Kaczynski the threat comes from LGBT people and from Europe where families can have two mummies or two daddies he said image copyright Getty Images image caption Jaroslaw Kaczynski has highlighted Polands Catholic heritage in focusing on LGBT issues Polands 1997 constitution states that a marriage is between a man and a woman  Civil partnerships be they between heterosexual or samesex couples are not legally recognised Christianity is part of our national identity the Catholic Church was and is the preacher and holder of the only commonly held system of values in Poland he said Outside of itâ¦ we have only nihilism Senior Catholic Church figures have gone further most notably the Archbishop of Krakow Marek Jedraszewski who on numerous occasions has identified the LGBT lobby and gender ideology as the new threat to Polish freedom following the end of communism in 1989 calling it totalitarian and a great threat to our freedom  Where Polands main political groups stand on samesex

facts about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid19 than in April  with admissions running at 1600 a day across the UK We have to keep our foot to the floor he said No evidence schools spread lots of Covid  Third of social care staff still not vaccinated First travellers arrive for hotel quarantine stay Plan to end lockdown cautious but irreversible Mr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending Englands restrictions but that the government wanted this lockdown to be the last with cautious but irreversible progress He added his plan next week would set out as much as we possibly can about the route to normality even though some things are very uncertain Although he said he was increasingly optimistic he admitted he could not give an absolute castiron guarantee that we wont face further difficulties I dont want people to think Im not optimistic Theres been a big change  science is now in the ascendency over the disease he added Mr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year I think that in combination with vaccination will probably be the route forward he said Michael Kill chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association said the acknowledgement would give late night businesses the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity he added Could this be the last lockdown That is of course a huge shared hope and the governments stated aim It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in  Who knew then that wed be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later Boris Johnson has been accused at times of overpromising and underdelivering during this crisis Today again hes urging caution  even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well Thats because ministers really dont want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation It comes after  more than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend  calling for a commitment to a free life and the ending of lockdown measures before May Steve Baker the deputy chair of the lockdownsceptic Covid Research Group CRG of Tory MPs leading the call said schools should return on 8 March hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May  when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine media caption Johnson We want progress to be cautious but also irreversible Earlier No 10 said the intention was to start getting pupils back into school on 8 March but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages The PMs official spokesman said it was important the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week with details to be set out in Mr Johnsons road map on Monday The spokesman said he would not preempt what the road map might contain but added It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March if the science and evidence allows LOCKDOWN RULES  What are they and when will they end SCHOOLS  When will they reopen VACCINE  When will I get the jab NEW VARIANTS  How worried should we be The government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups  including everyone over the age of 50  by the end of April Mr Johnson said This would run alongside giving second doses within the 12week window to those in the top four priority groups who have already had a first dose All those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions as well as adult carers are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination  With every day that passes it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid Science as Boris Johnson said is in the ascendancy It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use  two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results There is confidence the mutations while presenting a challenge can be overcome Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants No vaccine is 100 effective and some people may choose not to take it Thats why advances in treatment are vital too A cheap steroid dexamethasone is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients And last week it emerged an arthritis drug tocilizumab could also further improve survival chances There is still a long way to go but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back Speaking at the same Downing Street briefing NHS Englands chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as two sprints and a marathon He said the UK had passed the finishing line of the first sprint and now had a second sprint between now and 30 April to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups The marathon will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed Sir Simon added Meanwhile on Monday the UK recorded another 9765 new coronavirus infections according to the latest government figures It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10000 since 2 October A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend In other developments A third of social care staff in England have not had a Covid vaccine  Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said despite them being among the groups prioritised The first travellers required to stay at governmentprovided quarantine hotels under tougher border rules  have begun arriving in the UK Research by a team at the University of Warwick suggests that schools  do not appear to play a big role in spreading coronavirus in the community  DOWNTIME SYMPHONY  An hour of

close Share page Copy link About sharing Immigration has become one of the biggest issues in British politics in recent years and a story about migrant numbers again features heavily in the papers The Daily Telegraph leads with Theresa Mays admission that the government had been  blown off course  in its attempts to curb immigration to the UK and was unlikely to reduce net migration figures to the under100000ayear target it had set itself The home secretary gave an interview to the paper confirming that the coalition was shelving its pledge to achieve the reduction by 2015 It was a pledge David Cameron had said was a no ifs no buts promise the Telegraph notes Mrs Mays assertion that the rising migration figures were partly as a result of the British economys strength compared to EU rivals cuts no ice with her Labour counterpart the paper adds Continually making and breaking grand promises on immigration is only undermining confidence in the entire system Labours Yvette Cooper says The Daily Mail says the abandoning of the pledge has triggered a  furious political row  It says recent figures show net migration is currently running at 240000 a year The Daily Express highlights former Conservative minister  Peter Lilleys comments  that Most people believe Britain is full  and they are right We are already a nation of more than 60 million We cannot take any more and have to shut the door The Daily Mirror focuses on Ed Milibands vow to  shut rogue job agencies that undercut wages and exploit workers He will stop big firms using rogue agencies to hire staff on the cheap the paper says and ban job Â­agencies recruiting only from abroad Its a theme taken up by the Guardians editorial which says agency working and zerohours contracts have driven down pay levels to a level that encourages migration from lowwage economies Tackling Britains  hyperflexible underregulated labour market should be a priority  it adds image copyright Getty Images The Daily Telegraph has a feature by Mats Persson of the think tank Open Europe Mr Persson whose ideas the prime minister is said to be considering argues that inwork benefits  such as tax credits social housing and access to the NHS  should not be immediately available to new arrivals from other EU countries These benefits are a taxpayerbackedsubsidy enabling migrants from low cost countries to work at jobs most British workers would say they couldnt afford to take Mr Persson illustrates his point by arguing that a typical Polish migrant can up his or her takehome pay by 95 by coming to Britain and claiming working benefits but if those benefits were withdrawn the same Pole would be earning 27 less than if he or she had stayed in his or her native country The Express notes that former chancellor Kenneth Clarke has called the idea discriminatory Disquieting backdrop Mrs Mays pronouncements were not just on migration but addressed the threat the UK faced from potential terrorism by jihadists image copyright PA image

the Daily Telegraph the home secretary says Britain is facing the greatest terror threat of its history The idea that Britain faces a worse threat than during the IRAs bombing campaign is a  disquieting backdrop  the papers leader column says The Guardian focuses on another announcement Mrs May is expected to make that insurance companies will be banned from reimbursing ransom payments The measure is designed to  cut funding to barbaric terror groups  the paper explains In another story the Guardian casts doubt on whether the US airstrikes in Syria are undermining support for Islamic State IS jihadists The paper carries a series of interviews with Syrian opposition fighters who say support for IS is growing because of the bombing both from civilians and armed insurgents

move back in with them There is a real lack of jobs Its not just the graduates from this year competing for jobs its the graduates from last year she tells the paper In its editorial the paper says that the problem is not selfish oldies but poorly paid and insecure work coupled with a lack of affordable accommodation One alarming fact in the report is that most selfemployed people earn markedly less now than they did five years ago  This should disturb everyone because the rapid rise in selfemployment is constantly extolled as a good thing  the welcome liberation of the workforce from the

nearly 10000 accounts blocked Weve all struggled over the past year going in and out of lockdown but for 19yearold Phoebe theres been no escape online She was first trolled after posting body positive photos and messages on social media And she reckons the pandemic made things worse A photo Phoebe posted to mark International Womens Day in March last year sparked a torrent of abuse and attracted hundreds of comments about how she looked Its every single day This kept happening across the whole of 2020 It got to the point where from July I have not had a weeks break from any online abuse  In these last couple of months its been every single day there will be something or some incident or some comment Phoebe has been reporting abusive posts and blocking accounts that were sharing them Half of women and nonbinary people polled by online abuse charity Glitch and the End Violence Against Women Coalition say theyve experienced online abuse since the pandemic began And a poll of 2000 people for the National Childrens Bureau which was published in November 2020 suggests that more people were experiencing and reporting online abuse as bullying in schools decreased  because most people were learning from home image copyright Phoebe Jameson image caption Phoebe says she uses social media to try to be the woman the teenage me didnt have Phoebe says comments and DMs led to her making a suicide attempt in December It got to the point where the comments made me feel like I couldnt be here anymore really I ended up in hospital When she later posted about her suicide attempt online she received more abuse It was horrific I just logged off for the rest of Christmas and New Year to just enjoy it and not think about whats being said online she says Im not in that place now but I cant say Im not going to be in that place again from trolling because I didnt think that would ever happen to me I never thought it would reach that point Hyperdisgust during pandemic Imran Ahmed is the CEO of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate He says there has been an industrial level of trolling during the coronavirus pandemic and part of this has included online bullying Right now we are primed to think of things that arent like us as being dangerous he tells Newsbeat Think about literally what Covid is  someone you love could kill you just by coming near you  So were primed to think I dont want to see people I dont want to get too close We are in a hyperdisgust phase He says people who troll others online dont get a thrill from the abuse they send but from seeing the reaction from their victim If you give them what they want and show anger and pain that incentivises them to gain that pleasure again By taking away the possibility of gaining that pleasure by blocking them theyll stop He also says defending someone against trolls can sometimes do more harm than good because you rebroadcast compound and worsen the abuse He says blocking and reporting abusive posts and accounts is still our best option but also to remember that extreme cases may be against the law I shouldnt have to step away When Phoebe reported the death threats to her local police they recommended she log off social media She did that in the short term for her mental health but it isnt something she wants to do permanently This is becoming part of my life more especially  because were all virtual now Phoebe says I dont want to have to censor myself I think thats the other thing I tried to be a positive person for others and for my teenage self Im trying to be the woman that my teenage self never had It gets tough but I dont feel like I should have to step away because some people dont want me to be existing in that space Avon and Somerset police who Phoebe reported her situation to says on its website that its  officers will deal with online abuse  only in the most extreme cases These include a threat to someones life targeting specific individuals and persistent harassment and ongoing abuse image copyright Phoebe Jameson Phoebes decided not to pursue matters with the police But she does want social media companies to make it harder to set up fake account on their platforms  which is where a lot of the abuse she experienced came from Shes set up an organisation called The Speak Up Space where victims of sexual violence and harassment can share their stories and look for help and advice And despite the abuse she receives still feels like the positives of being social media outweigh the negatives It was nice when I had a break I just stuck to

About sharing Related Topics Brexit MPs say they now fear for their safety when they go to be interviewed by the media on a green opposite the Houses of Parliament What is going on For decades now College Green has been used as a venue for broadcast interviews  For MPs it has the advantage of being convenient  they simply have to stroll across the road from the House of Commons to be guaranteed a bigger audience for their views than they would ever get from speaking in the chamber For broadcasters College Green provides the allimportant sense of being at the heart the action and gives them access to a steady stream of willing interviewees image copyright Getty Images image caption AntiBrexit demonstrator Steve Bray talks to officers on College Green It has traditionally been seen as a haven for backbenchers eager to get on the airwaves Broadcast insiders call it the honeypot  MPs booked to do an interview by one outlet are collared by producers from rival outlets as soon as they come off air and ushered towards another microphone  Some MPs and ministers prefer to be interviewed in the more controlled and less muddy environment of the TV studio Police under pressure over MP harassment Most broadcasters including the BBC have studios at Westminster not far from College Green  where they can be interviewed down the line by presenters in another location College Green has traditionally tended to be pressed into action on big Parliamentary occasions such as budgets or general elections On really big occasions the main evening news bulletins will be presented from an elevated platform on College Green offering a commanding view of the Palace of Westminster all lit up at night for added drama News presenters dont always have parliamentary passes so hosting bulletins or news channel segments from within the building itself is not possible But the extra space and freedom of the openair studio makes the green a more desirable location anyway image copyright Getty Images image caption ProBrexit demonstrators are also making their voice heard TV cameras were not allowed in the Commons chamber until 1989  and broadcasters were allowed to film interviews with MPs in the building in only 2000 initially from a glass booth in the central lobby Strict rules remain about where cameras can be placed Filming on the green gives broadcasters more control as well as allowing guests without parliamentary passes to take part in live debates One thing the broadcasters cant control of course is what goes on in the back of their shots Interruptions by placardwaving protesters are an occupational hazard for anyone filming outside Parliament  People have every right to stage protests  the roads and greens around Parliament are public rights of way  and in normal times there is little real friction Brexit has changed that dynamic however The media has set up what is starting to feel like a permanent tented village as the story continues to dominate the news bulletins They might not broadcast from there every day but it has become a focal point for demonstrators The site is now ringed by metal barriers and the police have increased their presence The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day  A BBC spokeswoman said We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times  The Parliamentary authorities have issued revised safety advice to MPs planning to take part in media interviews on the green media caption Brexit protesters chant Nazi and scum at Conservative MP Anna Soubry Most demonstrators  including the small group of antiBrexit campaigners who set up their banners and flags outside Parliament every day and the proBrexit Leave Means Leave group who join them on occasions  are peaceful although they have had occasional runins with the police and each other The most dogged of the antiBrexit protesters Steve Bray engages in a daily game of cat and mouse with the broadcasters as he tries to get his slogan in shot In recent weeks however a more aggressive brand of demonstrators from the proBrexit side have started showing up to harangue and intimidate certain MPs as they make the short journey from the Commons to the green and back again Commons Speaker John Bercow has described them in a letter to the Metropolitan Police as a regular coterie of burly white men who are effectively targeting and denouncing members whom they recognise and dislike  most notably female and those from ethnic minority backgrounds Journalists such as the Guardians Owen Jones have also been targeted Sky Newss Kay Burley says she has been interviewed three times by police investigating alleged incidents of abuse amid the chaos that is College Green at the moment She told BBC Radio 5 Live she supported the right of people to protest but it has become increasingly vile and aggressive and yes intimidating as well specifically targeting antiBrexit Conservative MP Anna Soubry when she was on air More than 100 MPs have now called on the Metropolitan Police to do more to protect MPs  the police say they are ready to deal robustly with any instances of criminal harassment but they have to strike a balance that allows for protesters to exercise their democratic rights  A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online farright campaigner James Goddard  He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles He told police outside Parliament they were fair game and if you want a war we will give you a war  Mr Goddard emerged as a DIY farright campaigner last year as he began to gather followers after campaigning in support of the thenjailed antiIslam activist Stephen Lennon aka Tommy Robinson  Before the incident at Parliament involving Ms Soubry hed been helping to organise Francestyle yellow vest protests  including attempts to block bridges in London  Mr Goddard relies on donations from his followers  he frequently runs crowdfunding appeals for his campaigns  On Tuesday evening Facebook confirmed it has closed his account  We will not tolerate hate speech on Facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke realworld violence said a spokesman Minutes later his separate Paypal crowdfunding page disappeared too Related Topics Anna Soubry Brexit More on this story Police under pressure over MP harassment Published 8

2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Submitted photo After being labelled the patient zero of an outbreak of Covid a CongoleseCanadian physician says he became a target for racist threats a pariah in his community and a scapegoat for local officials  When Dr JeanRobert Ngola heard that he had to pick up his daughter last May he quickly did the maths His daughter lived in Montreal with her mother about seven hours away from his home in Campbellton New Brunswick  As a family physician he knew that he needed to be as safe as possible to limit the spread of Covid to others But as a parent he had to come get his child so that her mother could attend a family funeral in Africa In order to get her and have contact with as few people as possible he hopped in his car and drove all day spending the night at his brothers before driving her back  Before leaving Dr Ngola called the local police asking for clarity around the laws about selfisolation   New Brunswick has one of the strictest quarantine policies in Canada Along with several other eastern provinces it has formed an Atlantic bubble  in the early months of the pandemic most forms of travel into the bubble were restricted and anyone entering had to quarantine for 14 days But as a frontline worker he says police told him he was exempt Not wanting to leave his patients without a doctor he decided to go back to work On 25 May Dr Ngola heard that one of his patients had been diagnosed with the virus He got tested and began to selfisolate with his fouryearold daughter  At 11am on 27 May he learned he too had the virus although he had no symptoms  Then his life began to fall apart Within the hour his identity began to spread online Later in the afternoon Premier Blaine Higgs who leads the provincial government was chastising him on live television At least two other people had contracted coronavirus due to the actions of one irresponsible individual Mr Higgs said after nearly two weeks without a single case image copyright Getty Images Although the premier did not name Dr Ngola directly by that time people had connected the dots and photographs of his office were circulating online Provincial health officials told the media Dr Ngola had contracted the disease in the neighbouring province of Quebec and spread it to others because he did not follow the 14day mandatory quarantine for people who had been out of New Brunswick But Dr Ngola and his lawyer Joel Etienne say the rules were not clear and Dr Ngola was following the same practices as people around him  They also dispute the provinces claim that he was patient zero India coronavirus Our neighbours made us Covid19 pariahs Students fed up with being blamed for virus spike Although no criminal charges were filed Dr Ngola faces a civil charge for violating the Emergency Measures Act and could face a fine up to C10200 7600 Â£6000 The case is currently making its way before the courts His employer VitalitÃ© Health Network immediately suspended him without pay for breaking protocols  I was the scapegoat As soon as my diagnosis is madeâ¦ one hour later my life changed he said In a statement to the BBC a spokesperson for Vitalite confirmed that Dr Ngolas suspension continues and declined to comment further  The premiers office did not respond to the BBCs request for comment The reaction from the community was swift and brutal Dr Ngola who is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo said people were telling him to go back to Africa and other forms of racist abuse  A SIMPLE GUIDE   What are the symptoms TEENAGE RITUALS  Growing up interrupted SUPERSPREADERS  What makes some events so risky Quarantining in his home with his small daughter he feared for his safety when his address was leaked online and had to go under police protection But he was also constantly under police scrutiny he says because people kept phoning in with bogus tips claiming to have seen him break quarantine Dr Ngola says the harassment was so bad he had to leave the province He was offered a job in a small community in Quebec where he has been living for the past several months He says he feels welcome there but his experience in Campbellton has left psychological scars  I cannot have the same life because now Im public he says This is not the first time hes had to start over Born in the Congo Dr Ngola had wanted to be a doctor since he was a small child after coming down with polio and being unable to get the appropriate medical treatment because it was too costly  My childhood ambition was to become a doctor in order that children like myself would be spared he says He paid his way through school by tutoring other students and practised medicine during his countrys brutal civil war In 2000 he immigrated to Belgium where he had to retrain in order to continue to be a doctor Then five years later he relocated to Canada because he felt he would face less prejudice as an African immigrant Once again he went back to school in order to practise medicine Now he feels disillusioned Dr Ngola says he believes his race and immigration status played a factor in how he was treated not only by the public at large but by the provinces top officials image copyright Submitted photo What is the difference with me The difference is Im black and Im a foreigner Dr Ngola said  Although he felt like a pariah at home around the country his fellow physicians were rallying to his defence In September 1500 physicians signed a letter condemning his treatment and demanding an investigation into how his name was leaked to the press  All of us signed below have felt tremendous anger discomfort and frustration with the backlash that followed once you were publicly identified What unravelled thereafter was unjust unkind and dehumanizing the letter which was spearheaded by Dr Danusha Foster read We strongly believe that systemic racism coupled with the stigma surrounding individuals infected with the Covid19 virus have significantly contributed to the crucifixion of your character within the public eye Dr Foster a family physician who lives in Ontario says that when she first heard about Dr Ngola she like many others judged him Were in a deadly pandemic and health professionals should be held to a higher standard at this time because were supposed to be modelling for the general population what we should be doing she told the BBC image copyright Submitted photo image caption Dr Denusha Foster But after hearing about the abuse he was suffering and reading media articles critical of the provinces investigation she began to feel sympathy  He was being judged in the public eye before the facts were known she says She says patient confidentiality is the core of the doctorpatient relationship and whoever leaked his name should be held to account After talking about his case on online physicians groups she decided to organise the letter of support to show Dr Ngola that he wasnt alone  I hadnt even written my letter and I already had 800 names that wanted to sign she says We realised as we watched this case that what happened to Dr Ngola could have happened to anyone of us if we made one little mistake Did he break the rules Over 40 cases and two deaths have been connected to the outbreak in the Campbellton region since 27 May But it remains unclear if Mr Ngola was the source Anyone entering New Brunswick from another province outside the Atlantic Bubble is supposed to quarantine for 14 days  But residents of Campbellton which is on the border of Quebec were allowed to cross the border without selfisolating for certain reasons such as if they worked in Quebec had to attend a medical appointment in Quebec or if they shared custody of a child in Quebec According to the provincial guidelines  all such workers and individuals who are exempt from selfisolation must travel directly to and from work andor their accommodations selfmonitor and avoid contact with vulnerable individuals Dr Ngola spent about 30 hours in Quebec including an overnight stay with his brother to rest up after the sevenhour drive He also saw two colleagues in TroisRivieres although they were masked and socially distanced He also had contact with a petrolstation employee Dr Ngola said many of his coworkers went back and forth to Quebec and did not fully selfisolate so he did not think he was breaking the rules  image copyright Getty Images His employer Vitalite Health told the CBCs Fifth Estate that all workers were ordered to selfisolate after returning to the province unless they lived in Quebec  Mr Etienne says regardless of whether his client broke the rules the province failed to do its due diligence before blaming him for the outbreak He says they had not finished contacttracing the four individuals in Quebec whom Dr Ngola had contact with before claiming the doctor was the source of the Covid cluster in New Brunswick He says their own private investigator found that neither his brother the two colleagues nor the gas station employee tested positive for Covid His daughter however did Both she and her father have made a full recovery  There had been at least one confirmed case of Covid in Campbellton in the days prior to Dr Ngolas diagnosis and his lawyer says he could have got it from community spread Related Topics Democratic Republic of Congo Canada Coronavirus pandemic New Brunswick More on this story Canada Covid

before being smuggled to the islands via East Africa Made up of 115 islands the Seychelles has many porous borders which makes them hard to monitor and easy for drugs to come into the country Morning

PAcemaker image caption Flag protests took place across Northern Ireland including this one at city hall At the end of 2012 and throughout 2013 loyalist protests took place across Northern Ireland over the decision to fly the union flag at Belfast City Hall only on designated days Dozens of police officers were injured and scores of people arrested The protests also saw the middleground Alliance Party targeted including a death threat against East Belfast MP Naomi Long and councillors homes attacked in Bangor and Newtownards How did the protests start On Monday 3 December 2012 Belfast City Council voted to fly the union flag at city hall only on designated days  Nationalists at Belfast City Council had wanted the union flag taken down altogether but in the end voted on a compromise from the Alliance Party that it would fly on designated days Unionists said they considered the changes to be an attack on their cultural identity  A loyalist protest outside the building erupted into violence minutes after the motion was passed Disorder also broke out in east Belfast Fifteen police officers were injured as well as a press photographer and two security guards Police were criticised by Sinn FÃ©in for not anticipating the violence Council staff removed the flag at 0700 GMT on Tuesday It is now only flown on 18 designated days Why is the issue important to unionists Parades and flags are important symbols to loyalists who describe them as expressions of their culture The decision at Belfast City Hall followed a difficult but not explosive marching season during which there were numerous arguments and disturbances over specific parades  Many loyalists claimed that some nationalists were trying to erase their identity from Northern Ireland  The unionists argued that the flag had flown for decades above Belfast City Hall and the other parties should have left it alone Were loyalist paramilitaries involved Former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Matt Baggott told a press conference on 7 January 2013 after four successive nights of disorder in east Belfast I am concerned that senior members of the UVF in east Belfast   as individuals  have been increasingly orchestrating some of this violence  That is utterly unacceptable and is being done for their own selfish motives There is no excuse whatsoever for violence as weve said and we will be investigating that and taking the appropriate action Previously assistant chief constable Will Kerr had said members of both the Ulster Defence Association UDA and Ulster Volunteer Force UVF had been involved in violence around flag protests and that were now seeing senior members actively involved in orchestrating the violence How did the protests spread In the weeks before the city hall vote up to 40000  leaflets  criticising Alliance were distributed in a joint operation carried out by Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Unionist Party activists image copyright Pacemaker image caption The Alliance Party became an object of loyalist wrath Alliance accused the unionists of a blatant attempt to ramp up tensions over the union flag issue Unionists insisted their defence of the flag was a matter of principle and they wanted peaceful constructive protests However with the involvement of loyalist elements and others using social media the protests took on a life of their own spreading well beyond central Belfast  Protests followed in towns such as Carrickfergus Coleraine and Ballymena  Roads were also blocked in parts of Northern Ireland The Alliance Party was the target of threats and violence East Belfast MP Naomi Long was threatened as was councillor Laura McNamee An Alliance Party office was destroyed in Carrickfergus and councillors homes attacked in Bangor and Carrickfergus Why was the Alliance Party a target of loyalist wrath Alliance holds the balance of power on Belfast City Council and could have voted down the original motion to remove the flag on all

June 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright iStock Every year tens of thousands of people are conned by online scammers but it is not only the authorities taking action a network of techsavvy volunteers is also working to expose them We waste scammers time we waste their resources and we make them believe they are not as good as they think they are Jill  not her real name  explains to the  BBCs Victoria Derbyshire programme  She is part of a global network of socalled scam baiters who spend their evenings trying to unearth online con artists by pretending to fall for their tricks The ruses can range from emails saying the recipients have won the lottery to longlost relatives who have left them an inheritance Scammers are always going to be there but if we can take them down a peg and take a victim away from them any time we can then we are doing something good Jill adds One of the main techniques explains Wayne  a scam baiter who often works with Jill  is by leaking scammers details and their conversation scripts online The aim is for these to filter through to searchengine results so potential victims will be alerted if they type in the scammers name Wayne says police and other authorities use the data too image caption Wayne admits the scam baiters are not always the best people to help police the internet The scam baiters say they do not earn a penny from their work and that they have other reasons for taking on the con artists One man from the US who wished to remain anonymous wanted to turn the tables after his mother was caught up in a grandparent scam and came close to losing 5000 Â£3900 For Wayne the motivation is simply the buzz he receives from knowing he can help someone  He says people have contacted him via his website on the verge of suicide Questions remain however over whether scam baiters are sufficiently equipped  or best placed  to deal with scammers rather than the authorities Official advice is to report any suspected offenders to Action Fraud  the UKs national fraud and cybercrime centre which focuses much of its resources on prevention and raising awareness  And Wayne says scam baiters do point people towards the official routes when they feel out of their depth But Jill argues they still play an important role as advances in technology and the fact many of the scammers are overseas mean it is difficult for authorities to catch such criminals And they reject the label vigilante Vigilantes work outside the law says Wayne Twisted humour Waynes setup is rudimentary He works under various aliases mostly named after characters from his favourite childrens television shows of his youth He often makes himself seem more vulnerable  and potentially gullible  by pretending to have recently broken up from a partner To bait you do need to have something of a twisted sense of humour he jokes image copyright iStock Both Wayne and Jill always wait to be approached by scammers rather than seeking them out But they dont have to wait long Their names are on a socalled suckers list  effectively a database of people thought to be easy to con  which is passed around by scammers online The latest to get in touch is a man who emails Jill to say she has won the lottery in Africa Pretending to be husband and wife Wayne and Jill make a joint call back the aim being to waste the scammers time by arguing about which one of them gets the money Death threat They often have other scam baiters on standby who can be brought in to play other characters in their facade to confuse the scammer  and waste their time  for as long as they wish Surprisingly Jill considers her biggest success to be the time she received a death threat from a scammer she had targeted If you get a death threat you know youve really wound someone up I had one scammer driving round Madrid for a day trying to find Lynn who had gone to Madrid Of course I hadnt gone to Madrid I was in my front room He got so upset and said Im going to come and find you I dont care what the penalty for murder is in the UK Im going to find you image caption Jill says scammers deserve to be treated as criminals Jill tells it as a funny anecdote but it underlines the dangers involved I take great care in protecting my online persona she says I bait with email addresses that arent traceable I dont use any of my reallife information All of my characters are based somewhere 100 miles away from where I live Asked whether the death threat suggested scam baiters were taking their cause too far she firmly disagrees None of us are taking this far enough These people are criminals They dont deserve our sympathy They rob our elderly relatives so they deserve to be treated as criminals If we could get them arrested we would

who closely follow conspiracy and extreme right groups online the warning signs were all there At 0221 Eastern Standard Time on election night President Trump walked onto a stage set up in the East Room of the White House and declared victory We were getting ready to win this election Frankly we did win this election His speech came an hour after hed tweeted They are trying to steal the election He hadnt won There was no victory to steal But to many of his most fervent supporters these facts didnt matter and still dont  Sixty five days later a motley coalition of rioters stormed the US Capitol building They included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory members of Stop the Steal groups farright activists online trolls and others  On Friday 8 January   some 48 hours after the Washington riots  Twitter began a purge of some of the most influential proTrump accounts that had been pushing conspiracies and urging direct action to overturn the election result Then came the big one  Mr Trump himself The president was permanently banned from tweeting to his more than 88 million followers due to the risk of further incitement of violence  The violence in Washington shocked the world and seemed to catch the authorities off guard  But for anyone who had been carefully watching the unfolding story  online and on the streets of American cities  it came as no surprise The idea of a rigged election was seeded by the president in speeches and on Twitter months before the vote  On election day the rumors started just as Americans were going to the polls A video of a Republican

to a hashtag StopTheSteal The message behind it was clear  Mr Trump had won a landslide victory but dark forces in the establishment deep state had stolen it from him In the early hours of Wednesday 4 November while votes were still being counted and three days before the US networks called the election for Joe Biden President Trump claimed victory alleging a fraud on the American public Mr Trump did not provide any evidence to back up his claims  Studies carried out for previous US elections  have shown that voter fraud is extremely rare image copyright Getty Images By midafternoon a Facebook group called Stop the Steal was created and quickly became one of the fastestgrowing in the platforms history By Thursday morning it had added more than 300000 members Many of the posts focused on unsubstantiated allegations of mass voter fraud including manufactured claims that thousands of dead people had voted and that voting machines had somehow been programmed to flip votes from Mr Trump

nearly half a million comments shares likes and reactions  Dozens of other groups quickly sprang up in its place  image copyright Getty Images The idea of a stolen election continued to spread online and take hold Soon a dedicated Stop the Steal website was launched in a bid to register boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the vote On Saturday 7 November major news organisations declared that Joe Biden had won the election In Democratic strongholds throngs of people took to the streets to celebrate But the reaction online from Mr Trumps most ardent supporters was one of anger and defiance They planned a rally in Washington DC for the following Saturday dubbed the Million MAGA Make America Great Again March Trump tweeted that he might try to stop by the demonstration and say hello image copyright Getty Images Previous proTrump rallies in Washington had failed to attract large crowds But thousands gathered at Freedom Plaza that sunny morning One extremism researcher

conspiracy theories were also there Capitol riots Who broke into the building US Election 2020 Who are the Proud Boys  and who are antifa As night fell clashes between Trump supporters and counterprotesters broke out including a brawl about five blocks from the White House  The violence  although largely contained by police on this occasion  was a clear sign of things to come  By now President Trump and his legal team had invested their hopes in dozens of legal cases Although a number of courts had already dismissed fraud allegations many in the proTrump online world became fascinated with two lawyers with close ties to the president  Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood  Ms Powell and Mr Wood promised they were preparing cases of voter fraud so comprehensive that when released they would destroy the case for Mr Biden having won the presidency Watch Aleem Maqbools film America Storming the Capitol in which he examines the question  how safe is American democracy  Ms Powell 65 a conservative activist and former federal prosecutor told Fox News that the effort would release the Kraken  a reference to a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies The Kraken quickly became an internet meme representing sprawling unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud Ms Powell and Mr Wood became heroes to followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory  who believe President Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state made up of Satanworshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party media business and Hollywood What is QAnon What is the Kraken conspiracy  The lawyers became a conduit between the president and his most conspiracyminded supporters  a number of whom ended up inside the Capitol on 6 January  Ms Powell and Mr Wood were successful in whipping up sound and fury online but their legal efforts came to nothing When they released almost 200 pages of documents in late November it became clear that  their lawsuit  consisted predominantly of conspiracy theories and debunked allegations that had already been rejected by dozens of courts The filings contained simple legal errors  and basic misspellings and typos  Still the meme lived on The terms Kraken and Release the Kraken were used more than a million times on Twitter before the Capitol riot As courts rejected Mr Trumps legal cases farright activists increasingly targeted election workers and officials Death threats were made against a Georgia election worker and Republican officials in the state  including Governor Brian Kemp Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the official in charge of the states voting systems Gabriel Sterling  were branded traitors online Mr Sterling issued an emotional and prescient warning to the president in a press conference on 1 December  media caption This has to stop someones gonna get killed Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the

Supreme Court rejected  an attempt by the state of Texas to throw out election results  As the presidents legal and political windows continued to close the language in proTrump online circles became

breaching the walls of Jericho This echoed the rally organisers call for Jericho Marches to overturn the election result Nick Fuentes the leader of Groypers a farright movement that targets Republican politicians and figures they deem too moderate told the crowd We are going to destroy the GOP The march once again  turned violent   Then two days later  the Electoral College certified  Mr Bidens victory one of the final steps required for him to take office  On online platforms supporters were becoming resigned to the view that all legal avenues were dead ends and only direct action could save the Trump presidency  Since election day alongside Mr Flynn Ms Powell and Mr Wood a new figure had rapidly gained prominence among proTrump circles online Ron Watkins is the son of Jim Watkins the man behind 8chan and 8kun  message boards filled with extreme language and views violence and extreme sexual content They gave rise to the QAnon movement  In a series of viral tweets on 17 December Ron Watkins suggested President Trump should follow the example of Roman leader Julius Caesar and capitalise on fierce loyalty of the military in order to restore the Republic  Ron Watkins encouraged his more than 500000 followers to make CrossTheRubicon a Twitter trend referring to the moment when Caesar launched a civil war by crossing the Rubicon river in 49BC The hashtag was also used by more mainstream figures  including the chairwoman of Arizona Republican Party  Kelli Ward  In a separate tweet Ron Watkins said Mr Trump must invoke the Insurrection Act which empowers the president to deploy the military and federal forces Mr Trump met Ms Powell Mr Flynn and others at a strategy meeting at the White House the following day 18 December  During the meeting according to the New York Times Mr Flynn called on Mr Trump to  impose martial law  and deploy the military to rerun the election The meeting further stoked online chatter about war and revolution in farright circles Many came to see the joint session of Congress on 6 January normally a formality as a last roll of the dice  A wishful story began to take hold among QAnon and some MAGA supporters They hoped that VicePresident Mike Pence who was set to preside over the 6 January ceremony would ignore the electoral college votes The president they said would then deploy the military to quell any unrest order the mass arrest of the deep state cabal who had rigged the election and send them to Guantanamo Bay military prison   Back in the land of reality none of this was remotely feasible But it launched a movement for patriot caravans to organise ride shares to help transport thousands from around the country to Washington DC on 6 January image copyright Getty Images Long processions of vehicles flying Trump flags and sometimes towing elaborately decorated trailers gathered in car parks in cities including Louisville Kentucky Atlanta Georgia and Scranton Pennsylvania  We are on our way one caravaner posted on Twitter with a picture of about two dozen supporters At an Ikea parking lot in North Carolina another man showed off his truck The flags are a little tattered  well call them battle flags now he said As it became clear that Mr Pence and other key Republicans would follow the law and allow Congress to certify Mr Bidens win the language towards them became vicious Pence will be in jail awaiting trial for treason Mr Wood tweeted He will face execution by firing squad Online discussion reached boiling point References to firearms war and violence were rife on selfstyled free speech  social platforms  such as Gab and Parler which are popular with Trump supporters as well as on other sites In Proud Boys groups where members had once supported police some turned against authorities whom they deemed to no longer be on their side  Hundreds of posts on a popular proTrump site TheDonald openly discussed plans to cross barricades carry firearms and other weapons to the march in defiance of Washingtons strict gun laws There was open chatter about storming the Capitol and arresting treasonous members of Congress On Wednesday 6 January Mr Trump addressed a crowd of thousands at the Ellipse a park just south of the White House for more than an hour Early on he encouraged supporters to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard but he ended with a warning We fight like hell and if you dont fight like hell youre not going to have a country anymore So were going to were going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenueâ¦ and were going to the Capitol image copyright Rex Features To some observers the potential for violence that day was clear from the outset  Michael Chertoff former secretary of homeland security under President George W Bush blamed the Capitol Police who reportedly turned down offers of assistance from the much larger National Guard ahead of time He characterised it as the worst failure of a police force I can think of I think it was a very foreseeable potential negative turn of events Mr Chertoff said  media caption Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol To be blunt it was obvious If you read the newspaper and were awake you understood that youve got a lot of people who have been convinced there was a fraudulent election Some of them are extremists and violent Some of the groups openly said Bring your guns Still many Americans were astonished by Wednesdays scenes like James Clark a 68yearold Republican from Virginia I find it absolutely shocking I didnt think it would come to this  he told  the BBC But the signs were there for weeks A hodgepodge of extreme and conspiratorial groups were convinced that the election was stolen Online they repeatedly talked about arming themselves and violence  Perhaps the authorities didnt think their posts were serious or specific enough to investigate They now face pointed questions For Joe Bidens inauguration on 20 January Mr Chertoff is expecting a much stronger showing by security services than last Wednesday night  But that hasnt stopped many on extreme platforms calling for further violence and disruption on the day  There are questions too for the major social media platforms which enabled conspiracy theories to reach millions of people Late on Friday Twitter deleted the accounts of Mr Flynn the former Trump advisor the Kraken lawyers Ms Powell and Mr Wood and Mr Watkins Then Mr Trump himself  Twitter permanently suspends Trumps account Arrests of those who stormed the Capitol continue But most of the rioters still live in a parallel online universe  a subterranean world filled with alternative facts  They have already come up with fanciful explanations to dismiss Mr Trumps  video statement  posted on Twitter the day after the riots in which he acknowledged for the first time that a new administration will be inaugurated on 20 January He cant possibly be giving up they contend Among their new theories  its not really him in the video but a computergenerated deep fake Or perhaps the president is being held hostage  Many still believe Mr Trump will prevail Theres no evidence behind any of this but it does prove one thing  No matter what happens to Donald Trump the rioters who stormed the US Capitol are not backing down anytime soon Additional reporting Olga Robinson and Jake Horton All photographs

exactly is an executive order and how significant are they to a presidents legacy One of the first ways a new president is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders  While legislative efforts take time a swipe of the pen from the White House can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice  President Donald Trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege  Given his predecessors reliance on executive orders to circumvent Congress in the later days of his presidency he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle  What are executive orders Heres a look at some of what Mr Trump has done so far Climate change policy reversal Mr Trump signed the order at the Environmental Protection Agency EPA undoing a key part of the Obama administrations efforts to tackle global warming The order reverses the Clean Power Plan which had required states to regulate power plants but had been on hold while being challenged in court Before signing the order a White House official told the press that Mr Trump does believe in humancaused climate change but that the order was necessary to ensure American energy independence and jobs Environmental groups warn that undoing those regulations will have serious consequences at home and abroad I think it is a climate destruction plan in place of a climate action plan the Natural Resources Defense Councils David Doniger told the BBC adding that they will fight the president in court  Immediate impact  A coalition of 17 states filed a legal challenge against the Trump administrations decision to roll back climate change regulations The challenge led by New York state argued that the administration has a legal obligation to regulate emissions of the gases believed to cause global climate change Mars Inc Staples and The Gap are among US corporations who are also challenging Mr Trumps reversal on climate change policy  Travel ban 20 After an angry weekend in Florida in which he accused formerpresident Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower Mr Trump returned to the White House to sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban  The executive order titled protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States was signed out of the view of the White House press corps on 6 March The orders new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system   The updated ban Temporarily halts entry to citizens for 90days of six Muslimmajority countries Iran Libya Syria Somalia Sudan and Yemen  Removes Iraq from the previous list due to increased vetting of its own citizens Delays implementation until 16 March Allows current visa holders to travel to the US Does not affect permanent visa holders Green Card holders  Suspends the refugee programme for 120 days Treats Syrians like any other refugee or immigrant Removes the religious clause favouring religious minorities  namely Christians Immediate impact  Soon after the order was signed it was once again blocked by a federal judge this time in Hawaii  Trump signs new travelban directive Undoing Obamaera waterway regulations Surrounded by farmers and Republican lawmakers Mr Trump signed an order on 28 February directing the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers to reconsider a rule issued by President Obama The 2015 regulation  known as the Waters of the United States rule  gave authority to the federal government over small waterways including wetlands headwaters and small ponds The rule required Clean Water Act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources which the president described as puddles in his signing remarks  Opponents of Mr Obamas rule including industry leaders condemned it as a massive power grab by Washington Scott Pruitt Mr Trumps pick to lead the EPA will now begin the task of rewriting the rule and a new draft is not expected for several years  Immediate impact  The EPA has been ordered to rewrite or even repeal the rule but first it must be reviewed Water protection laws were passed by Congress long before Mr Obamas rule was announced so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen Instead the EPA must reevaluate how to interpret the 1972 Clean Water Act Coal waste A bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obamaera regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste Senator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an attack on coal miners  The US Interior Department which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December had said it would protect 6000 miles of streams and 52000 acres of forests Business regulations An attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses  Described as a twoout onein approach the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop The Office of Management and Budget OMB will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney Some categories of regulation will be exempt from the twoout onein clause  such as those dealing with the military and national security and any other category of regulations exempted by the Director Immediate impact  Wait and see Trump moves to cut business regulation Travel ban first version Probably his most controversial action so far taken to keep the country safe from terrorists the president said It included suspension of refugee programme for 120 days and cap on 2017 numbers indefinite ban on Syrian refugees ban on anyone arriving from seven Muslimmajority countries with certain exceptions cap of 50000 refugees The effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding USbound flights or held when they landed in the US   Immediate impact  Enacted pretty much straight away But there are battles ahead Federal judges brought a halt to deportations and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban  much to the presidents displeasure  Trump border policy Whos affected Border security image copyright Getty Images image caption A fence is already in place along much of the USMexico border On Mr Trumps first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015 he made securing the border with Mexico a priority He pledged repeatedly at rallies to build the wall along the southern border saying it would be big beautiful and powerful  Now he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise  One order declares that the US will create a contiguous physical wall or other similarly secure contiguous and impassable physical barrier The second order pledges to hire 10000 more immigration officers and to revoke federal grant money from socalled sanctuary cities which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government despite their leaders saying otherwise  Immediate impact  The Department of Homeland Security has a small amount of money available about 100m to use immediately but that wont get them very far Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars  money that Congress will need to approve Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republicanled Congress will need to come up with 1215bn more and the funding fight  and any construction  will come up against issues with harsh terrain private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans  The department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges but without a court injunction the money can be removed The Center for Biological Diversity an environmental group along with Arizona Democrat Raul Graijalva have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration  They argue the Department of Homeland Security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands  How exactly will Trump build the wall Two orders two pipelines image copyright Getty Images image caption With the stroke of a pen On his second full working day the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines  the Keystone XL and Dakota Access Mr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated and using American steel was a requirement Keystone a 1179mile 1897km pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change The second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site  Immediate impact  Mr Trump has granted a permit to TransCanada the Keystone XL builder to move forward with the controversial pipeline As a result TransCanada will drop an arbitration claim for 15bn in damages it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement Mr Trump made no mention of an American steel requirement Construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from Nebraskas Public Service Commission The Dakota Access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil  Keystone XL pipeline Why is it so disputed Dakota Pipeline Whats behind the controversy Instructing federal agencies to weaken Obamacare In one of his first actions as president Mr Trump issued a multiparagraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nations healthcare system The order states that agencies must waive defer grant exemptions from or delay any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states individuals or healthcare providers  Although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have its viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obamaera healthcare regulations wherever possible Immediate impact  Republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the US healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation That means Mr Trumps executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine Obamacare  Can Obamacare be repealed Reinstating a ban on international abortion counselling image copyright Reuters image caption Abortion activists were among the many protesters that came out against Trumps presidency one day after his inauguration Whats called the Mexico City policy first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan prevents foreign nongovernmental organisations that receive any US cash from providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country even if they do so with other funding The ban derided as a global gag rule by its critics has been the subject of a political tugofwar ever since its inception with every Democratic president rescinding the measure and every Republican bringing it back  Antiabortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this  and he didnt disappoint them Immediate impact  The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants The US State Department has notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US funding for United Nations Population Fund UNFPA would be withdrawn arguing that it supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation The agency has denied this pointing to examples of its lifesaving work in more than 150 countries and territories  This policy will be much broader than the last time the rule was in place  the Guttmacher Institute Kaiser Family Foundation and Population Action International believe the order as written will apply to all global health funding by the US instead of only reproductive health or family planning Trumps order on abortion policy What does it mean Withdrawing from the TransPacific Partnership image copyright Getty Images image caption The TPP pact would have affected 40 of global trade The TransPacific Partnership once viewed as the crown jewel of Barack Obamas international trade policy was a regular punching bag for Mr Trump on the campaign trail although he at times  seemed uncertain  about what nations were actually involved The deal was never approved by Congress so it had yet to go into effect in the US Therefore the formal withdrawal is more akin to a decision on the part of the US to end ongoing international negotiations and let the deal wither and die  Immediate impact  Takes effect immediately In the meantime some experts are worried China will seek to replace itself in the deal or add TPP nations to its own free trade negotiations the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership RCEP excluding the US TPP What is it and why does it matter Related Topics White House Donald Trump

millions of young people who are now reading and watching every new rumour and development related to his death It should make media houses more responsible says Dr Pathare adding that some of those young people could be in a mentally vulnerable situation He also blames some media houses limited understanding of mental health issues  image copyright Getty Images image caption Congress party leaders in Bihar have demanded a federal probe Mental health is a largely unaddressed issue in India and one that ironically has been wrongly portrayed by Bollywood for years Our films mostly portray a depressed person as crazy or as somebody who is always sad Dr Pathare says A TV channel recently broadcast an exclusive video that showed Sushant relaxing at his home a few months before his death The channel declared that the actor looked happy in the video and offered it as clinching evidence that he was not fighting depression Dr Pathare says this shows the channels narrow understanding of the subject Its a myth that a depressed person is always sulking he adds The Mumbai police have also been criticised for releasing details such as what the actor was searching for on the internet a few hours before his death image copyright Hindustan Times image caption The actor often spoke about struggles of making it in Bollywood without any connections Vikram Singh a former top cop in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh says the police should not be releasing such sensitive information How it helps the investigation is beyond my understanding The risk is that many young people may try to search for similar things and it could lead them into a dark place he adds Politics and a turf war Elections are due to be held later in the year in Bihar  the actors home state So its not surprising that politicians want to be seen fighting to get justice for Sushants family Bihars Chief Minister Nitish Kumar has recommended that the case be investigated by the federal investigative agency the CBI  or Central Bureau of Investigation The federal government run by Mr Kumars coalition partner the Bharatiya Janata Party has accepted the recommendation and the CBI has begun its probe

war A Bihar police officer who travelled to Mumbai to investigate the case has been quarantined for allegedly breaking Covid19 restrictions  Such public display of turf war has been really ugly For gods sake a family has lost their son and you need to show some sensitivity Mr Singh says adding that all investigative agencies need to work together to get justice for Sushants family Closure is

human informant inside alQaida who provided the tipoff to MI6 even relaying the serial number of the device it was hidden in British counterterrorism police then located and defused the bomb inside the plane at East Midlands Airport If that had gone off as planned over Chicago hundreds would have been killed said the former intelligence officer  Dr alJabri transformed Saudi counterterrorism

commander killed in a US drone strike The deaths in Qasem Soleimanis hometown of Kerman led to the ceremony being delayed The burial is the last in a series of funeral events that have brought millions on to the streets in Iran Soleimanis killing has raised fears of a conflict between the US and Iran The head of the Quds force was tasked with defending and projecting Iranian interests abroad and was hailed as a hero by many in his home country Immediately after his death Iran threatened retaliation How did USIranian ties get here A basic guide Does this mean war Your questions answered and more  What does international law say about the assassination Voices from Iran Soleimani did not deserve such a fate To the US Soleimani was a terrorist and in explaining why he ordered the strike President Donald Trump said he was acting on an imminent threat What happened in Kerman The crush in the southeastern Iranian city happened at the start of a funeral procession that had drawn vast numbers of people on Tuesday morning ahead of the planned burial Eyewitnesses told BBC Persian the streets were not wide enough to hold the number of people and with other roads closed off there was nowhere to escape to A coroner quoted on Irans Isna news agency put the death toll at 50 with those injured numbering more than 200 Video online showed people on the ground their faces

in Iraq and a powerful leader among Iraqs Shia militias The US reportedly denied a visa for Irans Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to visit the UN in New York this week a move that appears to breach an

parliamentarians have approved a motion designating the US Army and the Pentagon as terrorist organisations and allocated extra funds for the force once headed by Soleimani A show of unity Analysis by Kasra Naji BBC Persian Only seven weeks ago Iran witnessed the biggest and most violent antigovernment demonstrations in decades Security forces killed anywhere between 330 and 1500 protesters in more than 100 cities across the country Thousands more were injured and arrested So why have so many people come out to pay homage to Soleimani in spite of widespread discontent There is no doubt that feelings are running high Arguably the most important man in the countrys armed forces has been assassinated by the US which for many is the archenemy of Iran But it is also clear that the government launched a massive effort to mobilise as many people as possible A huge turnout sends a strong signal to Donald Trump that the government enjoys widespread support It sends the message that a war with Iran would rally Iranians behind their leaders in the event of foreign aggression and that any war could well be long and costly Read Kasras analysis in full What are the latest USIran exchanges In an

revolutionary Had the constitution allowed it he might have been able to turn his modest successes into a story alluring enough to win another term of office But in a reaction against the monopolisation of power by Marcos in the 1970s and 80s Mr Aquinos mother Corazon  who led the movement that overthrew Marcos  also oversaw a new constitution which limited presidents to a single term

caption Critics blame a young electorate with no memory of the regime of Ferdinand Marcos for the political return of his family At the other end of the Philippines in Iliocos Norte Ferdinand Marcos is also feted as a hero and saviour 30 years after he was overthrown in the first people power uprising Back then Marcos and his freespending wife Imelda were vilified as symbols of greed corruption and repression  But today the Marcos museum in his home town of Batac which glorifies his life and achievements is crowded with visitors from all over the country Many of them are young  more than half of those eligible to vote were not born when Marcos was overthrown Some came out won over by the melodramatic representation of Marcoss sacrifices they had watched inside and the viewing they had of his embalmed body lying in state next door image copyright Reuters image caption Despite thousands of deaths Imelda Marcos late husband is respected by many for big infrastructure projects high exchange rates and authoritarian rule His daughter Imee is governor of the province Even Imelda who at 86 is in poor health is running unopposed as a congresswoman A host of other Marcoses and their relatives are contesting many of the 240 or so positions up for grabs in the election And his son Ferdinand Jr or Bongbong has been leading the polls to win the vicepresidency  running a slick social media campaign which appeals to the young in particular In vain have the victims of the older Marcoss martial law in which thousands were imprisoned and tortured cried warnings about forgetting the past When I asked Bongbong how much of a problem his fathers reputation was he laughed Quite the opposite  its a boost he said  image copyright Getty Images image caption While domestic issues have dominated the elections foreign policy consequences could be felt as far away as Washington If the polls are correct Mr Duterte and Mr Marcos could end up running this country Noone is sure how they will do it nor in what state they will leave this countrys fragile democracy when they are finished But after holding out so much promise when it was born 30 years ago that democracy has delivered little of substance to most Filipinos and they cannot be expected to care too much if it is put at risk Related Topics Philippines More on this story A beginners guide to the Philippine elections

Copy link About sharing image copyright Blizzard image caption Starcraft is a fastmoving strategy game played in real time Robots that train themselves in battle tactics by playing video games could be used to mount cyberattacks the UK military fears The warning is in  a Ministry of Defence report  on artificial intelligence Researchers in Silicon Valley are using strategy games such as Starcraft II to teach systems how to solve complex problems on their own But artificial intelligence AI programs can then be readily adapted to wage cyberwarfare the MoD says Officials are particularly concerned about the ability of rogue states and terrorists to mount advanced persistent threat attacks which can disable critical infrastructure and steal sensitive information Human trounces AI at StarCraft game Nightmare robots show off softer side AI plays video game to learn about world Not only will AI increase the variety and tempo of cyberattacks it will also decrease the cost and increase the variety of actors able to undertake this activity the report says  As the requirement for skilled specialists involved in the attack diminishes the limitation will become access to the AI algorithms needed to conduct such an attack  In other words any actor with the financial resources to buy or steal an AI APT advanced persistent threat system could gain access to tremendous offensive cybercapability even if that actor is relatively ignorant of internet security technology  Given that the cost of replicating software can be nearly zero that may hardly present any constraint at all This is likely to be a live issue by 2020 or soon thereafter  For example the stateoftheart AI is being trained in tactical reasoning by playing computer strategy games  AIs like this could then be readily adapted to drive APT cyberattack tactics where the AI is competing against human or nonadaptive automated cyberdefenders The report cites Googles DeepMind artificial intelligence research project which is using Starcraft II  a realtime strategy game for PC and Mac users launched in 2010  to train programs to think for themselves Londonbased DeepMind which says it is committed to making the world a better place through artificial intelligence by solving complex problems such as climate change has also used Atari and Go games to train its systems But like other artificial intelligence researchers those at DeepMind were attracted to the complexity and fastmoving nature of Starcraft which involves a threeway conflict between humans the insectoid Zerg and Protoss aliens  image copyright YONHAP Reuters image caption Go player Lee Sedol pits his wits against Googles AI programme AlphaGo DeepMind said testing its artificial intelligence agents in games that are not specifically designed for artificial intelligence research and where humans play well was crucial to their development  Starcraft players build bases to gather resources that help make combat units to seek out and destroy opponents Other technology companies including Facebook have now developed artificial intelligence bots to play the game after makers Blizzard Entertainment released tools to enable them to do so Human players trounced artificial intelligence bots made by Facebook DeepMind and other companies in a Starcraft tournament in November suggesting there is still some way to go before the robots take over Steven Murdoch an information security research fellow at University College London said artificial intelligence bots with the ability to carry out sophisticated cyberattacks on their own were fairly far away Even those that could play games such as Go and Starcraft against humans were not very creative and relied on following a simple set of rules  As technology advances more automation will be available particularly for the delivery of malicious software but the preparation of attacks and development of tactics will still require human expertise for the foreseeable future he told BBC News AI programs could be stolen and misused as the MoD says in its report but current systems are quite specific to a particular task and it takes considerable skill and expertise to adapt a system to a new application area he added The MoD report says the private sector is leading the way in artificial intelligence research  and the technology industrys reluctance to appear too close to defence or security agencies is creating a skills shortage in the military Some Western commercial entities have publicly declared policies stating they will not contract with defence or security agencies which may compound the challenges facing the MoD says the report  This is in stark contrast to other states which have enshrined access rights to expertise technology and data in their national legislation The report proposes setting up a register of security cleared UK nationals with AI and robotics skills to be called on in times of emergency Related

sharing image copyright EPA image caption Attackers encrypted users devices and typically demanded a ransom of 300600 in Bitcoin The US and UK governments have said North Korea was responsible for the WannaCry malware attack affecting hospitals businesses and banks across the world earlier this year The attack is said to have hit more than 300000 computers in 150 nations causing billions of dollars of damage It is the first time the US and UK have officially blamed them for the worm Thomas Bossert an aide to US President Donald Trump first made the accusation in the  Wall Street Journal  newspaper Mr Bossert who advises the president on homeland security said the allegation was based on evidence He did not produce any evidence in the article but said US findings concurred with judgments from other governments and private companies He added that Australia Canada and New Zealand also share the US conclusion that North Korea was behind the attack Following the interview the UK Foreign Office also blamed North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions The National Cyber Security Centre assessed that is highly likely that the North Korean Lazarus hacking group had committed the attacks  Minister for Cyber Lord Ahmad said in a statement  In May Windows computers hit by the cyberattack had their contents locked with users asked to a pay a ransom to have their data restored EU police body Europol called the scale of the attack unprecedented Why blame N Korea now Analysis Gordon Corera BBC security correspondent  Britains National Cyber Security Centre part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency first attributed the May 2017 Wannacry attack to North Korea within weeks of the ransomware spreading  The speed was because the UK led the international investigation after the National Health Service was hit hard  The US intelligence community may have taken longer to concur with that assessment but there is still the question of why the White House is only going public now  Governments used to be cautious about attribution in cyber attacks but it is becoming increasingly common  beginning with the claim North Korea was behind the attack on Sony in 2014 and more recently involving Russias alleged hacking in the 2016 US election  This latest claim is almost certainly an attempt to put more pressure on North Korea in the crisis over its nuclear programme with the attempt to rally international support behind the notion that the country is a real danger  whether from cyber weapons or nuclear weapons And to make the case that further action of some kind needs to be contemplated image copyright Reuters image caption Mr Bossert warned that we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us In the Wall Street Journal piece Mr Bossert said North Korea must be held accountable and that the US would continue to use a maximum pressure strategy to hinder the regimes ability to mount cyberattacks He did not specify what action if any the US government planned to take in response to the findings North Korea is already facing major economic sanctions after being redesignated a statesponsor of terrorism last month  amid tension over its nuclear programme and missile tests  Malware patches and worms defined UK say cyberattack was launched from North Korea North Korea has acted especially badly largely unchecked for more than a decade and its malicious behaviour is growing more egregious WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless Mr Bossert wrote   As we make the internet safer we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organisations or hostile nations he went on The tool kits of totalitarian regimes are too threatening to ignore  He added that Microsoft and Facebook both acted to disable North Korean cyberattacks on their own initiative last week without any direction or participation by the US Microsoft later issued a statement  saying that last week the company working together with Facebook and others in the security community took strong steps to protect our customers and the internet from ongoing attacks by an advanced persistent threat actor known to us as ZINC also known as the Lazarus Group Among other steps last week we helped disrupt the malware this group relies on cleaned customers infected computers

report which indicates hundreds of files were indeed copied The documents which were stolen over a period of many months relate to Arrow III missiles unmanned aerial vehicles UAVs commonly known as drones ballistic rockets Cyber Engineering Services CyberESI tracked the activities of the hackers over eight months between 2011 and 2012 It said the data taken by the hackers suggested they had been after intelligence relating to Iron Dome Iron Dome is a complex antimissile defence system which can intercept and destroy rockets and shells The technology has been widely credited with preventing the deaths of many Israeli civilians during the ongoing conflict with militants from Gaza CyberESIs report compiled in 2013 also indicates the attacks were made using highly sophisticated tools resembling those used by Chinese hackers to infiltrate US defence firms  an attack in which the Chinese government denies any involvement image copyright Getty Images image caption Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert stands next to a Rafael missile The data collected makes strong indications that the actors behind this attack originated from China it says This assertion is based on the activity during the past year that Cyber Engineering Services has observed on compromised networks as well as the geolocation of the IP internet protocol addresses retrieving the exfiltrated data The nature of exfiltrated data and the industry that these companies are involved in suggests that the Chinese hackers were after information related to Israels allweather air defence system called Iron Dome Gigabytes stolen CyberESI which operates out of Maryland in the US monitored data being stolen from two leading Israeli defence contractors Israel Aerospace Industries IAI a governmentowned company that develops missiles and aircraft Rafael Advanced Defense Systems a governmentowned company established in 1948 which develops surfacetoair missiles A spokeswoman for IAI initially confirmed to Mr Krebs the attack had taken place and been reported to the appropriate authorities However IAI subsequently said the information reported regarding the leakage of sensitive information is incorrect and only its civilian nonclassified network had been hacked A spokesman for Rafael said the company did not recall such an incident image copyright AP image caption The hackers allegedly took documents related to the Arrow missile But the report seen by the BBC suggests sensitive data was taken from IAI and that Rafaels network was compromised with hackers able to deactivate security software and harvest authentication data including passwords In total the report says gigabytes of data were stolen from the Israeli companies including word documents power point presentations spreadsheets PDFs executable exe files Some of the stolen technical documents are said by CyberESI to have contained intellectual property data and were marked as being controlled by US government International Traffic in Arms ITAR regulations  US connections Both IAI and Rafael were heavily involved in developing the Iron Dome missile defence system which allows Israel to intercept rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip  The US which already collaborates with Israeli firms over Arrow III  jointly designed by IAI and Boeing now wants to invest in future versions of Iron Dome technologies In May 2013 the Pentagon accused China of carrying out a sophisticated cyberspying campaign on US diplomatic economic and defence organisations The raid on the Israeli companies bore similar characteristics experts at CyberESI told the BBC using tools that were known to originate from China The attacks were part of an advanced persistent threat APT  a form of highly organised and targeted hacking APTs have been used for industrial espionage in the past and tend to use sophisticated methods not easily available to the vast majority of cyberthieves  image copyright AFP image caption The US wants to invest in future versions of Iron Dome technologies Executive emails stolen CyberESIs report also featured a third Israeli company Elisra originally a US company and now a leading supplier to the Israel Defense Forces IDF Elisra which is not involved in Iron Dome appears to have been comprehensively infiltrated by the hackers who stole data from folders named Military Spacs and UAV and infiltrated the email accounts belonging to the chief executive and several senior managers The attackers also stole passwords and signin details allowing them to roam around the networks undetected  Elisra did not respond to a BBC request for comment In January 2014 another security company reported that 15 Israeli defence computers had been compromised via a malicious email

media caption The BBCs John Sudworth was detained while filming the reported hub of the hacking operation A secretive branch of Chinas military is probably one of the worlds most prolific cyber espionage groups a US cyber security firm has said  Mandiant said Unit 61398 was believed to have systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data from at least 141 organisations around the world The White House said it has taken its concerns about cybertheft to the highest levels of Chinas government China has denied hacking and questioned Mandiants report Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei Determining their origins are extremely difficult We dont know how the evidence in this socalled report can be tenable Mr Hong added that Beijing firmly opposes hacking has taken steps to prevent it and is also a victim of cyber attacks In an indication of the military sensitivity around the Shanghai site pinpointed by the report as home to the hacking group the BBCs John Sudworth and his camera crew were briefly detained by soldiers when they went to film the facility They were only released once they had handed over their footage Extensive campaign In its unusually detailed report  USbased computer security company Mandiant said it had investigated hundreds of data breaches since 2004 most of which it attributed to what it termed Advanced Persistent Threat actors The details it had uncovered it said convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese government is aware of them The most prolific of these actors is APT1 which Mandiant says is a single organisation of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006  From our observations it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen it said adding that it was likely governmentsponsored and one of the most persistent of Chinas cyber threat actors  We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a longrunning and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support said Mandiant The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to the site of 12storey building in the Pudong area of Shanghai It said that Unit 61398 of the Peoples Liberation Army is also located in precisely the same area and that the actors had similar missions capabilities and resources Among the findings about APT1 in the report were that it is staffed by hundreds possibly thousands of proficient English speakers with advanced computer security and networking skills has hacked into 141 companies across 20 industries 87 based in Englishspeaking countries and is able to steal from dozens of networks simultaneously has stolen hundreds of terabytes of information including blueprints business plans pricing documents user credentials emails and contact lists  stayed inside hacked networks for an average of 356 days with the longest lasting 1764 days targeted industries identified by China as strategically important under its Five Year Plan for economic growth Groundless Unit 61398 has for some time been suspected by the US of being central to Chinas cyber espionage programme the New York Times reports  Mandiant admitted there could be one alternative explanation for its findings that a secret resourced organisation full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghaibased telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multiyear enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398s gates performing tasks similar to Unit 61398s known mission Several governments foreign companies and organisations have said in the past they suspect China of carrying out extensive cyber espionage over periods of several years On Tuesday White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the Obama administration had repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials including in the military and we will continue to do so  Mr Carney declined to comment specifically on the contents of the report Last month the New York Times said its systems had been infiltrated over a period of four months after it wrote a report on the alleged wealth of Chinas outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao Mandiant which the paper hired to investigate traced the hack to China However the paper said its breach had been attributed to a different group The Wall Street Journal also reported a

2011 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption Look into the ball What does 2012 hold for business technology Although those of us following the Mayan long calendar may be heading into 2012 with some trepidation for those taking a longerterm view here is our annual peek into what next year holds Just as there are 12 days of Christmas 12 people from across the technology spectrum give their insights to what the next year will hold  We have the first six here with part two following on Friday Its been a  turbulent year for technology  and enterprise is no exception  The consumerisation of IT continues apace with more and more of us bringing our own devices to work Cloud computing seems to be almost ubiquitous and virtualisation no longer sounds like something to do with the transporter in Star Trek  These topics and more all  made it into last years predictions  So what do the experts think is hovering on the horizon in 2012 Tom Standage  Digital Editor The Economist Number one would be social networking in business I think this is going to be very significant because there are a number of reasons why companies might want to do this I think theyve been slow to because of the perception that using social networks is wasting time what you might call social notworking image caption Tom Standage sees 2012 as the year NFC will finally take off And in fact the opposite is true I think the chances are that the future of enterprise software looks like Facebook  Were seeing some companies adopting this already through systems like Chatter Salesforce Yammer and Jive  theres a whole bunch of them The other thing of course is that people entering the workforce at this point are used to using social media so if you give them enterprise software that looks like Facebook theyll feel right at home  Another thing to watch for is that Google may lose control of Android Its because the tablet market is going to be divided between Amazon and Apple from the looks of things Its very hard to see how anyone else can get in in the middle  image caption The future of enterprise software looks like Facebook Amazon can subsidise the cost of its tablets using subsidies from the sale of content and other things They are essentially portable shops a very clever idea  I think its entirely possible that they dominate at the bottom end and Apple dominates at the top end because it has scale it can buy screen and processing power like noone else can and it has the pricing power of its incredibly strong brand  This is a problem for Google because if this does happen that means that the dominant kind of Android tablet is the kind where Android itself is sort of hidden and is controlled by Amazon The third thing is what happens to Research in Motion RIM Someone will buy them I think The question is will they buy the whole of RIM in its current form image caption Blackberries for sale  and will manufacturer Research in Motion be bought as well RIM itself could split in two into its hardware and services division and start offering Blackberry services as an app I would be very surprised if RIM is still a company in its current form this time next year One of my predictions from last year I would like to reiterate and that is wireless payments  I was expecting the iPhone that came out this year to have an NFC near field communication chip in it and to shake up wireless payments  It didnt happen Im still convinced its going to happen I think its going to happen next year and the iPhone 5 will have an NFC chip in it  This I predict will be the latest example of where Apple blesses a technology that is out there but not really being done properly and Apple comes along and goes This is how you do it Elissa Fink  Tableau Software Firstly big data is just getting bigger and starting to really impact not just the IT organisations and the people that know how to deal with data but also the everyday knowledge worker the everyday manager and the everyday business leader who have a lot of data they need to get through to make good decisions image caption Even more adoption of mobile technologies will take place in businesses Number two is that the pace is quickening towards making enterprise software more like consumer software Making it easier to use faster with far less training than ever before And then number three would be mobile Mobile adoption is going mainstream in business Organisations are adopting tablets and particularly the iPad at very fast rates and people want to be able to access their information wherever they are even if its just in a meeting next door I would say these are the top three trends were seeing in no particular order William Dudley  Group director operator services Sybase 365 I think were going to see significant press not from Apple but about Apple My prediction is that one of the things the iPhone 5 will do that will be significant will be to support NFC NFC is just a trigger to start the process of paying for goods But NFC doesnt do any good unless merchants have a point of sale capability to accept that  image caption The next incarnation of the iPhone will be a major moment in 2012 says William Dudley And given that Apple has a tremendous database around their app store and iTunes I would suspect that Apple would want to play a part in creating a point of sale ecosystem  I dont have a lot of details but I kind of suspect that this could be a place where they could play and have a big impact Apple really has been a catalyst for multiple parts of the industry Not to say that Google wont continue to accelerate their payment purchasing mobile service Number two is probably around devices  I think were going to see Windows Phone not die a slow death but sort of hold its own  I think RIM isnt done yet Blackberry devices are popular worldwide and in some markets in the Middle East and the UK theyre very popular And theyre certainly very well engrained in enterprises  RIM has got some capabilities and features that the Apple Android even Windows Phones do not So I would not count them out yet Ben Holmes  Partner Index Ventures Theres been enormous coverage of 3D printing When we invested last year in a 3D printing company it was still science fiction but it is rapidly moving from science fiction to science fact I think its an incredibly powerful concept the idea of consumers being able to choose and make devices and products themselves I think its just at that point where the costs are falling very rapidly that its now becoming more affordable Two years ago it was used by highend architectural practices and by Formula One teams to design and prototype their engines image caption 3D has evolved from science fiction to science fact picture courtesy of Shapeways I think increasingly the smartphone is becoming a sort of remote control for the world around you  Already you can order your food through this device you can use it to hail a cab to find concerts and control the heating in your house Then theres mobile gaming A lot of VCs venture capitalists are probably attacking this theme Facebook gaming is massive  but mobile gaming is still pretty small despite the success of some big names like Angry Birds I think a lot of the games which are doing well in iOS and Android they are fairly crude ripoffs of what happens on Facebook I think very few companies have really thought deeply about the types of games that fully leverage this device I think there will be a Zyngasized company or bigger built off the back of mobile  Zynga has probably 5060 of the social gaming market The biggest company in mobile gaming has a 15 share Neil Campbell  Global head of security Dimension Data I think 2011 was the year of awareness when it comes to advanced persistent threats an organised group or government that commits cyber attacks and sadly 2012 will be the year that advanced persistent threats continue at an incredible pace to plague the internet  And I say that because theyre relatively simple in their execution theyre taking advantage of relatively simple vulnerabilities and they produce a lot of output in the form of all the information that becomes available to the perpetrators  which can be used for a number of reasons from espionage to fraud to blackmail image caption Neil Campbell predicts a tough year for cyber security Until that becomes very difficult to carry out then well see the popularity of advanced persistent threats continue to increase The thing that would stop the vulnerabilities being there is really basic security  Weve been talking about this for years When you think about the effort it takes to secure a network it tends to be getting it perfect that takes the effort it should be relatively easy to secure the basics What conversation could be carried out today without cloud sneaking in there  The security needs of the cloud are down to the capabilities of the cloud provider in the rush towards the cloud Im sure there will be many situations where the two dont match Bring your own device BYOD  which is the trend for people to buy their own work devices  can only increase as each generation becomes more computer literate image caption The cloud could bring security conflicts between businesses and service providers Thats left organisations with the choice of embracing that trend and proactively developing a stance and policies on BYOD  If you ignore it people find ways to bring their favourite device to work and make it work That can include things like setting up their own wireless access points or driving a hole through your firewall to access their email  People can be very creative when it comes to using technology they love in the way that they want to use it Steven Prentice  VP and analyst Gartner The control that the IT department has traditionally had over IT is perhaps more illusory than they thought  It is slipping away The increasing use of mobile devices and consumerisation people using their own systems social computing and social networking collaboration tools the rise in software as a service  business units are buying services as opposed to going to the IT department for systems It is a challenging time and IT leaders need to be proactive in their approach and changing their attitudes  The thing thats going to hit most organisations I think is the whole big data explosion  It is driven by the wider internet of things the proliferation of connected devices producing a mountain of data  Organisations are always saying give us better data to help us make better decisions I think IT is on the verge of being able to deliver some of those things Its not going to be easy there are all sorts of technology variables to be weighed but the data can be collected the data can be analysed I think the internet of things is going to be one of those potential game changers Mobile has become or is becoming the dominant form of access to the internet  I think that the whole social thing the investment bubble on this is going to burst Weve seen some outrageous valuations during the dotcom boom While I dont think that anyone is suggesting that social is going to go away theyre perhaps going to be a bit more realistic Part two of our look ahead will be published on Friday 30 December

Reuters The unprecedented hacking of celebrity Twitter accounts this month was caused by human error and a spearphishing attack on Twitter employees the company has confirmed Spearphishing  is a targeted attack designed to trick people into handing out information such as passwords Twitter said its staff were targeted through their phones The successful attempt let attackers tweet from celebrity accounts and access their private direct messages The accounts of Microsoft founder Bill Gates Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West were compromised and shared a Bitcoin scam It reportedly netted the scammers more than 100000 Â£80000 The attack has raised concerns about the level of access that Twitter employees and subsequently the hackers have to user accounts By obtaining employee credentials they were able to target specific employees who had access to our account support tools They then targeted 130 Twitter accounts  Tweeting from 45 accessing the DM inbox of 36 and downloading the Twitter Data of 7 — Twitter Support TwitterSupport  July 31 2020   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites View original tweet on Twitter Twitter acknowledged that concern in its statement saying that it was taking a hard look at how it could improve its permissions and processes Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons the company said Not all the employees targeted in the spearphishing attack had access to the inhouse tools Twitter said  but they did have access to the internal network and other systems Once the attackers had acquired user credentials to let them inside Twitters network the next stage of their attack was much easier They targeted other employees who had access to account controls Analysis By Joe Tidy cybersecurity reporter Twitter isnt clarifying whether or not their employees were duped by an email or a phone call The consensus in the information security community is that it was the latter  Phonecall spearphishing commonly known as vishing is bread and butter for the sort of hackers who are suspected of this attack  The criminals obtained the phone numbers of a handful of Twitter staff and by using friendly persuasion and trickery got them to hand over usernames and passwords that gave them an initial foothold into the internal system Twitter hack What went wrong and why it matters FBI investigates major Twitter hack As Twitter puts it the scammers exploited human vulnerabilities You can imagine how it possibly went  Hacker to Twitter employee Hi Im new to the department and Ive locked myself out of the Twitter internal portal can you do me a huge favour and give me the login again The fact that Twitter staff were susceptible to these basic attacks is embarrassing for a company built on being at the forefront of digital technology and internet culture  Twitter said the initial spearphishing attempt happened on 15 July  the same day the accounts were compromised suggesting the accounts were accessed within hours This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems the company said This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service media caption Technology explained What is phishing Twitter did not state whether the attack involved voice calls despite a previous report from Bloomberg stating that at least one Twitter employee was contacted by attackers through a phone call Phishing is most commonly done by email and text message encouraging recipients to click on links that take them to websites with fake login screens Spearphishing is a version of the scam targeted at one person or a specific company and is usually heavily customised to make it more believable One victim whose account was compromised told the BBC there were several things Twitter could have done differently They shouldnt give the ability to a single employee to remove both email address on file and twofactor authentication they said I understand why theres a need for this  for example if a dormant account has a very old email thats inaccessible and youve lost your phone or something  but it should require two employees to sign off They also said communication from Twitter was poor It took 10 days to reset this account with no actual personal response from Twitter I literally got a click here to continue automated email from

moment a group of undercover police arrested Grant West on a train A computer hacker who sold the personal data of thousands of people on the dark web faces jail after admitting a string of offences  Police began investigating Grant West 26 after he conned details from Just Eat customers in 2015 The personal data of around 165000 people was compromised Detectives later found he had 63000 credit and debit card details  and seized more than Â£500000 in bitcoins belonging to West He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud computer misuse and drug offences West from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent used phishing emails to extract customer data from various companies  Between July 2015 and December 2015 he targeted online food delivery firm Just Eat using a scam in which customers received a bogus email offering a voucher in return for answering questions about the service  image caption Grant West sent fake emails to customers offering vouchers The emails allowed West to harvest information  including customers names addresses and payment card details  in order to sell to other criminals There is no suggestion that Just Eats own computer systems were hacked or compromised  Detectives believe he targeted customers of just about every major online vendor from Argos to Uber as part of his criminal enterprise using millions of email addresses to indiscriminately trick people into revealing their financial information Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the nowdefunct online dark web market Alpha Bay with the user name courvoisier The details were sold as Fullz  a slang term on the dark web used to describe a full set of customer details that would allow others to defraud individual bank accounts and credit cards  image caption West would ask Just Eat customers to answer questions about the service The courvoisier account sold details belonging to 9627 people  many of whom lost significant amounts to other online fraudsters Police say West made more than Â£180000 from the scam The proceeds from his business were converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts  The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than Â£200000  but also gave specialist detectives from Londons Metropolitan Police their first lead West used his girlfriends laptop and police traced the computer via a series of IP addresses despite his best efforts to cover his digital tracks As detectives moved in on West they realised that getting their hands on the laptop with his fingers on the keyboard was crucial  A team of covert officers tracked West and while he was using the computer in the first class carriage on a train from Rhyl to London officers pounced on him seizing the unlocked computer  The arrest was captured on the trains CCTV On the laptop they found the financial information of more than 100000 people      image caption The dark web page used by West Officers also raided Wests home address and found an SD card with the details of 63000 debit and credit cards seven million email addresses with passwords and the details of more than 500 companies  all the components required to commit mass online fraud They also seized Â£25000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis  As well as financial information West also sold cannabis online  which he shipped to customers  and how to guides for fellow hackers  Police say West treated his fraudulent activity as a day job sometimes spending 18 hours a day hacking financial information and doing online deals  At first sight his lifestyle was simple  the family home was a caravan in a residential park  but West funded luxury holidays and goods with stolen credit card details  His former girlfriend Rachael Brookes 26 from North Wales also enjoyed the cash generated by the frauds At one point using stolen details to buy a new bikini  She was sentenced on Wednesday to a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorised access of computer material His Honour Judge Michael Gledhill QC told Ms Brookes that she was very fortunate indeed not to be jailed and said of her relationship with West that she had fallen into the arms of a villain and a rogue image caption West used his girlfriend Rachael Brookes laptop for his criminal activities West has no formal qualifications and although he directed the frauds investigators believe he was working with others Bitcoin wallets belonging to West were emptied the day after he was arrested At current prices those Bitcoins are estimated to be worth Â£15m  Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gallagher  who led the investigation  said police were uncovering the darkness and shady areas where criminals operate on the dark web and were bringing them into the light   There was a myth that Bitcoin in particular and cryptocurrencies more generally was anonymous and it was also a myth that people can operate with impunity on the dark web and remain anonymous he said A spokesperson for Just Eat said We were made aware of a phishing scam which took place in 2015 and at the time took steps to mitigate thisâ¦ at no point were Just Eat systems compromised or breached Protecting our brand and our customers from online fraud is of utmost importance to us  West will be sentenced on 25 May Correction 19 September 2018 This article has been amended to remove any

About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption It took minutes for the scammer to take over Six weeks ago a young woman called Zed not her real name was in a meeting at work when a message popped up on Facebook Messenger from a distant friend Hey babe it began The friend asked Zed to vote for her in an online modelling competition which she agreed to do  But then  disaster Adding her email address to the competition register had caused a tech meltdown her friend said She needed to borrow her email login to fix it quickly and restore her votes  Zed was unsure The friend begged  her career was at stake she pleaded Still in the meeting and powerless to make a call Zed gave in  a momentary leap of faith Except it was not her friend that she was talking to  someone else had got into the account and was pretending to be her  Its a scamming technique known as spear phishing image copyright Getty Images What is spear phishing Phishing uses behavioural psychology to trick victims into trusting the attacker in order to obtain sensitive information said Paul Bischoff of  Comparitech  who also talked to Zed  Spear phishing is less prevalent but far more dangerous Spear phishing targets an individual or small group of people The attacker can gather personal information about their target to build a more believable persona How do I protect myself Besides never sharing the credentials for your online accounts a good way to stay safe is to enable twostep authentication This means that users must enter another code besides their password received for example by their mobile phone to log in This can usually be set up in the security settings for your account or during the signup process Twostep authentication is offered by Gmail Hotmail Apple Amazon Yahoo Facebook and Twitter  among others  Within minutes Zed watched in horror as she was locked out of one account after another as well as her Apple iCloud where she stored all her data  including a photo of her passport bank details and some explicit pictures The hacker took control of all her IDs as they were all linked to the email address details she had supplied  The scammer also activated an extra layer of security called twostep authentication meaning that they received all alerts about her accounts and could reset them Then a man called The number had a Pakistan area code  He started the call by saying he didnt want any drama he didnt want me to cry he wanted me to talk to him like a professional she said He sounded young perhaps a college student she thought Get news from the BBC in your inbox each weekday morning Immoral He accused her of leading an immoral life He had seen her photographs he knew she had smoked and had boyfriends and was sexually active  He asked her what her parents would think and was furious when she said they already knew He claimed he had hacked thousands of women Zed says He said 10 or 12 he had felt bad about because he couldnt find anything about them that was wrong Zed was not part of that group He said he was happy when he hacked my account That I deserved everything He told her he would post the explicit pictures on her Facebook page  where she has more than 1000 friends image copyright Getty Images image caption The scammer said he had targeted thousands of people I offered him money I asked if I could pay He said Dont talk about money He sounded irritated she said Instead he wanted her to perform a sex act for him on camera  Zed refused Either you do it for me or you do it for the whole world he told her  and uploaded one of the photos to Facebook  Zed had already warned her boyfriend and parents who assembled an army of friends waiting to report activity on her account Within 15 minutes it had been disabled by Facebook  but she still received concerned messages from contacts A friend who is like a brother sent me a message  it wasnt him who had seen the photo but a friend of his she said I feel like I mustnt think too much about how many people saw the photos The last thing the scammer said to her was Have a great life It seemed to me the only reason he was doing this was to morally police women and get them to do stuff for him Zed said image copyright Comstock image caption The man didnt want money He wanted a gallery of explicit photographs of women That seemed to be his motive Zed does not consider herself to be digitally naive She is a bright articulate 20something from India who works in the media industry on the US east coast I have been tech savvy and on the internet almost my entire life  but Ive never really seen the power of what people can do until now she says  Regaining control of her accounts has been a struggle It took Zed a month to get her Apple ID back after engineers created a bespoke questionnaire for her containing answers that were not stored in her account Gmail and Facebook have also been restored but she has lost Snapchat and her Hotmail address  her central account which she had used for more than 13 years  Chink in the armour I feel for the poor woman  these scams are so easy to fall for said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University I think what it shows is that security is a combination of people process and technology  You can be very savvy in any one or two of these but scammers are superb at finding novel combinations that frankly we just wouldnt think of  I know it sounds so obvious but regardless of who they are you should not share your username and password  Give these scammers a small chink in the armour and they are sadly brilliant at getting in and running amok in your digital life Zed still uses iCloud but does not store personal stuff on it anymore  and has activated twostep verification everywhere   I still see the value in the storage But I will never ever give any information away again she said Zed originally decided to share her story on community site Reddit after trying to find others who may have been conned by the same man I was really shocked to discover that I found absolutely nothing she said I was hoping that speaking up about it would remedy that problem and encourage others to share their stories It also felt like the only way to get back at him As far as Zed knows the scammer has not been caught Cybercriminals come in all shapes and sizes said prof Woodward  Their motive is not always monetary gain As we have sadly seen of late revenge or just being plain malicious is a growing trend  Related Topics Cybersecurity Social media More on this story How hackers handle

link About sharing image caption Javed Khans dad was impressed with his new wheels Bitcoin has soared to trade at an eyewatering 48000 Â£34820 following the news that Tesla has bought 15bn of the cryptocurrency  Enthusiasts will tell you its the future of money  but investing in the notoriously volatile virtual currency can be a rollercoaster and its not without risk The hunt for new coins using powerful computers is also  causing a surge in energy demand   which is not so good for the environment Here are some of your Bitcoin adventures It paid for a holiday in Iceland James Saye tech consultant  image copyright James Saye I first invested in Bitcoin in 2017  I was nervous about putting too much in so I went for around Â£500 I cashed it in for Â£2500 during one of its peaks and had a great holiday in Iceland  the cash came in handy Iceland is lovely but expensive I bought in again in 2018 when the price was lower so Im still in but I dont regret cashing out when I did Its part of my pension plan Heather Delaney founder of Gallium Ventures image copyright Heather Delaney Ive been the silent cryptoinvestor I put in Â£5 at the very beginning and Ive built it slowly and steadily over time I see it as a longterm strategy meaning the rapid highs and lows are not ones that cause me anxiety  although ask me as I near my retirement and we shall see what I think then Based on how much I have invested in Bitcoin over time versus what I see today I have a 58541 increase in my investment  Ive never cashed it out  but I have converted some to other currencies as the market has fluctuated I know loads of people who have done exciting things with their investments but for me its part of my pension plan I know Im not typical  He didnt get a single penny back David Stubley founder of 7 Elements cybersecurity firm image copyright David StubleyGetty Images We had a client whose Bitcoin wallet was fraudulently accessed and all the money was transferred out of it He had intended to use it as a deposit on a house The man had been spooked by reports of fluctuations in the currency and decided to check his wallet But he clicked on a fraudulent link which led him to a phishing site a complete clone of the real thing He had 84 bitcoins and the fraudsters transferred 83 of them At the time in 2017 they were worth 475000 We tracked the payment on the blockchain a kind of shared digital public ledger  we could see it rolling across various wallets and finally it reached a wallet containing 15m of currency While the final identity of the fraudsters could not be identified we were able to have the wallets frozen so at least denying access to the stolen funds Our client was irate but philosophical Today that stolen Bitcoin would be worth Â£28m Once its gone it really has gone I bought a Bentley  Javed Khan independent trader  image copyright Javed Khan My Bitcoin journey didnt start as an investment At first it was a form of transferring money I didnt have to wait for confirmation from banks and so on  it was convenient In 2018 I noticed Id make a transfer leave some Bitcoin in my wallet and Id see the prices go up  and before I knew it I was seeing profit which surprised me I had been telling my friends I was using it as a transfer tool I hadnt thought about investing in it In January 2020 I cashed in my Bitcoin profits and bought a Bentley in Dubai where I now live I sent a video from the showroom to my mum and she cried she was really proud I would only put in money that I could afford to lose The most Ive lost is the transaction fees  when the price drops I dont lose faith  I think the best time to buy Bitcoin is when nobodys talking about it  wait for the hype to die down My electricity bill was A600 a month when I was mining Bitcoin Rohan Muscat project manager and electrical engineer image copyright Rohan Muscat I became aware of Bitcoin in 2010 but being a bit of a hardware geek I wanted to mine it In late 2016 I bought a pair of graphics cards to mine and at first I did pretty well with it A startup Id done some consulting for gave me some Horizon State tokens another form of cryptocurrency to pay part of my way and in January 2017 those plus my mined assets were worth A40000 Â£22000 I decided to trade it a bit and investigated bots while moving to bigger scale mining  At first it paid for itself but then it went downhill and was borderline breakeven My electricity bill shot up to A500A600 a month because the mining rig needed so much power I ended up selling the mining gear and Im currently sitting on about A2000 in crypto  I could have made more if Id jumped in and out but the emotions and risks in trading have burnt me and Id rather not take the risk  Bitcoin helped me buy my house Daniel Crocker business owner  image copyright Daniel Crocker In 2012 I was doing an apprenticeship at an IT company At lunchtime we used to chat about little ways of making money on the side Nobody had really heard of Bitcoin but we decided to give it a go and we spent a few weeks on it  It didnt last long but luckily I kept hold of mine  I traded them in last summer and got half the deposit for my house Ive still got a little bit but Im just going to sit tight  its not something I want to pin my future on  I do know people who have gone in deep but I think Ive been lucky enough already Related Topics

Unprecedented changes in lifestyle in the coronavirus pandemic led to an acceleration in shifts in criminal behaviour in Wales a crime expert has said Levels of reported crime fell across Wales from October 20192020 including in the first few months of the pandemic But figures show reports of cyber crime stalking and harassment spiked Professor Martin Innes said challenges were unprecedented in modern times The Cardiff University professor said while it was hard to predict the future an increase in digital crime during the pandemic teamed with the economic impact and increases in social tension mixed for a worrying cocktail for postlockdown crime Covid lockdown rule breakers could make pandemic longer Policing Covid in Wales Coughed at and spat on Police forces across Wales have repeatedly warned of being  under immense pressure  during the pandemic as they try to enforce Covid laws while dealing with serious and violent crime Recent figures  released by the Office of National Statistics  show 245591 crimes were reported to Welsh police forces between October 2019 and September 2020 a 7 fall on the year before although this does not include fraud figures The number of fraud offences increased by 8 to 14845 during the same period While the number of burglaries 18 thefts 22 and shoplifting offences fell between September 20192020 stalking and harassment reports increased by 11 in Wales with 36770 reports Domestic abuse charities also reported marked  increases in calls for help when schools returned in September  after abuse was not reported during lockdown Prof Innes director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University said crime had been shifting for years but lockdown had seemed to accelerated rates of personal and digital crime as people were stuck at home and spending more time online DyfedPowys Police saw the largest increase in reports of stalking and harassment offences with 5229 reports a 34 increase compared to the year before In North Wales police reported an increase in stalking and harassment crimes as well as a rise in disability and transphobic hate crime media caption A BBC investigation has found online scams selling fake protective equipment and coronavirus tests While the coronavirus pandemic has seen many acts of kindness police have warned some criminals have used Covid19 to scam people out of their life savings Figures  published by Action Fraud  show victims of cyber crime and fraud in Wales have reportedly lost Â£354m with almost 13000 crimes reported since the start of lockdown on 23 March Health officials and police have warned scammers claiming to work for the NHS are targeting vulnerable people online offering fake Covid vaccines in return for cash or personal details DyfedPowys Police also reported a  significant increase in romance fraud  with victims in west Wales losing Â£13m between January and November last year with officers saying criminals are targeting the lonely in lockdown image caption Prof Innes said that empty shops could become hot spots for antisocial behaviour when lockdown was eased Prof Innes said the shift to cyber such as online hate crime drug dealing over apps and smear campaigns was a huge challenge for forces and they would need to invest in expertise and technology to be able to recover evidence He said the impact of the pandemic on drug trade and gang operations like County Lines was concerning as criminal operations would have changed Just like everybody else has changed their behaviour in the pandemic those involved in drug behaviour have probably done the same and probably some of those innovations theyve made will stick At a recent North Wales Police and Crime panel Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said that officers were predicting an increase in digital cyber criminality and it would be a complex and challenging area for the future media caption He would push shove and kick me out of bed South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael warned increased levels of serious violence and domestic abuse were likely to continue following the pandemic In a report to the  South Wales Police and Crime Panel Mr Michael  said The scale of the economic downturn and subsequent rate of recovery will fundamentally shape the post pandemic crime and disorder landscape in the medium to long term He added People are spending more time online  increasing the risk of phishing grooming cyber attacks and sextortion  Payment preferences are also shifting to increasingly be online which again opens up opportunities for online fraud Meanwhile reports of public order offences also increased across all four forces by 8 with DyfedPowys Police recording an increase of 29 during the year to September 2020 In DyfedPowys and Gwent Police areas documents show the forces said crime had increased after lockdown measures were first eased in summer 2020 In  Gwent reports of sexual offences increased by

lockdown media caption Covid lockdown rule breakers flee Cwmbran salon in police raid In the  DyfedPowys area drug offences increased during the first lockdown in March  before decreasing significantly later in 2020 The force warned that public tensions remained high due to Covid restrictions and this had led to the number of reports of public order offences remaining high There had been exponential increases in antisocial behaviour reports due to breaches of lockdown rules it said In July and August when restrictions began to ease there was a sharp rise in violent attacks but the force said this was down to an increase in alcohol related incidents In North Wales by the start of December officers had issued 582 fines for Covid19 restriction breaches with two Â£10k fines issued for illegal music events media caption The impact of Covid rulebreakers Prof Innes said when lockdown measures were eased again antisocial behaviour and low level public disorder could spike in communities and with people struggling due to losing their jobs crime levels would return to prepandemic levels People have been cooped up and there wont be an awful lot of things for people to do as the weather gets nicer he said We can already see some of the social tensions kind of bubbling away when you look across Europe Longer term we are going to see a lot of empty shops and town centres

cybersecurity specialist and author of Hackable How To Do Application Security Right says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop While many larger companies may well have done this not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so but Mr Harrington stresses its importance Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned controlled and configured by the company he says This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants image copyright Ted Harrington image caption Ted Harrington says that workers should not be too scared to report a possible cybersecurity breach Definitely dont have staff using their personal computers for work says Sam Grubb an Arkansasbased cybersecurity consultant and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it he says So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen This might affect the work you are doing or in a worstcase scenario lead to the compromise of coworkers devices or other company devices such as servers Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a  VPN or virtual private network  so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firms servers and everyone else in the company image copyright Getty Images image caption Should firms give home workers shredders Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities he says Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers lions and bears you drive through the underground tunnel where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side However even with work laptops VPNs and the latest cybersecurity software systems in place staff can still make damaging mistakes such as falling prey to a phishing email  a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some  that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid19 or invited to have the vaccine  They ask the recipient to clink on the link which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer New Tech Economy  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape For this reason both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cybersecurity training Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face says Mr Grubb  Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit She says for example that employees should avoid talking about work on social media while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out image copyright Tsedal Neeley image caption Harvard Universitys Tsedal Neeley says that staff need to know who to call in the IT department With even the most cybersecurity aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to If an employee falls victim to an attack make sure that they know a who to contact and b that their outreach is welcome and wont result in termination he says You dont want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes Tsedal Neeley a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cybersecurity problems to Engaging with their firms ITcybersecurity experts is crucial she says Peter the computer network manager says this engagement should be frequent Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100 confident about and it does not hurt to ask your IT department It is better to check than be compromised Related Topics

Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Reuters image caption Singles Day is a shopping event created by Chinese online retailer Alibaba which rakes in billions of dollars in sales every year Singles Day the worlds biggest online shopping event has kicked off with consumers estimated to spend billions of dollars  much of which is being eyed by scammers This years event is expected to continue to break records across Asia as more people stay home and shop online amid the Covid19 pandemic while those unable to travel overseas for shopping trips are expected to revenge spend online  It represents a huge honeypot for scammers who over the years have come up with increasingly innovative ways to trick consumers from creating fake apps to claims of formaldehydesoaked clothes Some shoppers in China have lost tens of thousands of dollars to such ruses What are Chinese police saying this year Authorities from several provinces including Anhui Jiangsu and Sichuan have issued warnings on social media platform Weibo about a fake refund phone scam How it works a person impersonating a customer service officer from an ecommerce site phones the victim to inform him that a recent purchase is either out of stock or damaged and that as compensation they will give him a refund that is more than the amount that he paid He then asks the victim for bank account details so that he can process the refund  Singles Day 3m people 4000 planes and ships China continues to bounce back from virus slump Police say they have already seen many such instances in the past few weeks during preSingles Day sales A woman in Yunnan province recently lost a total of 200000 yuan 30000 Â£22900 recently after she was tricked into believing that she would be getting a refund on 200 yuan worth of clothes that she bought on ecommerce platform Taobao  She had transferred money to scammers multiple times after being told that there were problems with their system and that she had to pay to unfreeze her account  What other Singles Day scams have taken place before The fake refund scam has seen various iterations over the years In 2018 scammers reportedly posed as customer service officers offering refunds on clothes said to be ruined by excessive formaldehyde One woman in Wuxi city lost 44000 yuan 7000 this way after she scanned a QR code sent by a scammer which asked for her bank details  Last year the formaldehyde scam was tweaked to trick mothers into believing that the chemical had tainted their orders of baby diapers  media caption Alibaba Singles Day Dollars or data Other scams involve counterfeit shopping apps which are made to look and function like those by retailers such as Taobao and JDcom As they look so similar to the real deal victims are tricked into giving away personal information such as mobile numbers and bank account details  According to a 2018 report by Chinese online security firm 360 Security Brain close to 4000 fake shopping apps were downloaded on more than 300000 mobile devices in China in November that year  image copyright Getty Images image caption Some have been scammed by counterfeit shopping apps made to look like those by retailers such as Taobao There have also been reports of fraud related to cashondelivery packages where confused family members are asked to pay cash upfront when signing for delivered packages to their door  Why are there so many Singles Day scams  Singles Day is the worlds biggest online shopping event in terms of spending with much of the revenue generated by Chinese online retail giant Alibaba  Last year their gross merchandise value on Singles Day reached more than 210bn yuan Â£23bn US31bn which is double that of Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined This year Alibaba is claiming to have hit 372bn yuan of sales within the first 30 minutes of the event including preSingles Day orders Originally created by the company as a Chinese shopping festival its now expanded across the region with other online retailers in countries such as Singapore Thailand and the Philippines all holding their own versions image copyright Getty Images image caption Staff sorting out parcels after Singles Day last year in the Chinese city of Jiujiang Also known as Double 11 as it is held annually on 11 Nov  the shopping festival offers buyers huge discounts on everything from household items and fashion accessories to cars and even houses The huge number of transactions during this period presents scammers with ample opportunities and ecommerce fraudulent activities saw significant growth during the sales period across Asian countries last year according to data by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky  Mr Yeo Siang Tiong general manager for South East Asia said victims often fall prey to scams on Singles Day because they get caught up in the excitement while trying to get the best deals In addition many of the phishing scams in particular have become quite convincing making it hard for consumers to differentiate between truth and fiction he said  What can shoppers do to protect themselves  Never give away critical personal information such as bank account details over the phone Ecommerce platforms such as Taobao would typically have a customers bank information already saved in their system so refunds should be able to be processed automatically  Fake refund scams also often offer you more than what you paid for which would rarely happen in a real situation If it sounds too good to be true it probably is  As for Internet phishing scams double check web addresses if you are redirected to them from other landing pages said Kasperskys Mr Yeo or try to access deal pages directly through the legitimate website Related Topics Jack Ma China Alibaba More on this story China

Italian Japanese and Turkish languages have been found The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns 1 Click here for a cure image copyright Proofpoint  image caption Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen Researchers at the cybersecurity firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments  The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details It says up to 200000 of the emails are being sent at a time  We have seen 35plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns with many using fear to convince victims to click says Sherrod DeGrippo from the companys threat research and detection team Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day Its obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for

input all their financial and tax information Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email says Carl Wearn head of ecrime at Mimecast And certainly do not click on

This little measure can save you they claim But Proofpoint says the attachment doesnt contain any useful advice and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger  This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims every move online To avoid this scam be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO as they are

an example of hackers weaponising fear and panic  It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page where people are encouraged to enter their email and password Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page making it seem even more authentic  Of course the hackers now have control of the email account Cofense says the combination of a rather good forgery and a high

sharing image copyright Reuters EasyJet has admitted that a highly sophisticated cyberattack has affected approximately nine million customers It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details accessed The firm has informed the UKs Information Commissioners Office while it investigates the breach EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April This was a highly sophisticated attacker It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted the airline told the BBC We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code  known as the CVV number  on the back of the card itself EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks  It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting company intellectual property rather than information that could be used in identity theft There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused however on the recommendation of the ICO we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays In response to the breach the ICO  said that it was investigating People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly When that doesnt happen we will investigate and take robust action where necessary It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its  advice on its website  on how to spot such scams Phishing  Phishing attempts  which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data  have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis  Google is  blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day  to Gmail users It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid19 said Ray Walsh a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on he said Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future  As a result it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data Turbulent times The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel leaving airlines struggling financially These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet said Mike Fenton chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan To add to the companys woes it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed When it comes to cyber security the airline industry doesnt have a great record  The British Airways breach in 2018  should have been a wakeup call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an alltime low after this image copyright Getty Images image caption British Airways was fined a record Â£183m over a large data breach in 2018 British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018  Initially it said that only 380000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details The ICO later issued a record Â£183m fine over the breach Compensation payouts to customers could see that reach Â£3bn Under GDPR General Data Protection Regulation if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data it could face fines of up to 4 of its annual worldwide turnover It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but if so consumers could be eligible to claim compensation raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers Millions of EasyJet customers details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers  but even more people now need to be vigilant Generally personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims names make fraudulent purchases or sell on to other criminals The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear Their provider should already have stopped the card a new one will be issued and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018 some found this a frustrating and timeconsuming task Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords and be wary of any unexpected transactions Everyone else particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages  Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet banks or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves Are you an EasyJet customer Have you been a victim of the cyberattack Share your experiences by emailing  haveyoursaybbccouk  Please include a contact number if you are willing to

close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Russian spies are targeting organisations trying to develop a coronavirus vaccine in the UK US and Canada security services have warned The UKs National Cyber Security Centre NCSC said the hackers almost certainly operated as part of Russian intelligence services It did not specify which organisations had been targeted or whether any information had been stolen But it said vaccine research had not been hindered by the hackers Russia has denied responsibility We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain We can say one thing  Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts said Dmitry Peskov a spokesman for President Putin according to the Tass news agency The warning was published by an international group of security services the UKs NCSC the Canadian Communication Security Establishment CSE the United States Department for Homeland Security DHS Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency CISA  the US National Security Agency NSA One expert said it was plausible that despite the Kremlins denials Russian spies were involved The received wisdom is that in cyberspace attribution is difficult but not impossible commented Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank Usually the security services are much more hedgy in their language if they think there is any doubt  Cozy Bear the named group has been implicated in past cyberattacks and has left quite a trail and there are fairly good links to the Russian state itself In recent years Western security agencies have become more willing to call out hackers targeting companies and organisations in their countries in the hope it will deter them  But the latest accusations are more unusual since officials are directly pointing the finger at Russian spies rather than talking generally about statebacked hackers or using other more cautious references  And they are also challenging them over targeting something that the general public recognises as being highly sensitive  coronavirus vaccine research  rather than simply some company or government departments information  However on another level we should not be too surprised by the claim  Understanding vaccine research and other details about the pandemic has become a top target for intelligence agencies around the world and many others including Western spies are likely to be active in this space The UK US and Canadian agencies said the hackers had exploited software flaws to get access to vulnerable computer systems and had used malware called WellMess and WellMail to upload and download files from infected machines They are also said to have tricked individuals into handing over login credentials with spearphishing attacks Phishing  emails are designed to trick the recipient into handing over their personal information Spear phishing  is a targeted and personalised form of the attack designed to trick a specific individual Often the email appears to come from a trusted contact and may include some personal information to make the message seem more convincing But one cybersecurity expert said the Russians were unlikely to be the only ones involved in such a campaign They have lots of people we have lots of people the Americans have even more people as do the Chinese commented Prof Ross Anderson from the University of Cambridges Computer Laboratory They are all trying to steal this kind of stuff all the time Who is accused of being responsible image copyright Crowdstrike The NCSC calls out a hacking group called APT29 also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear It says it is more than 95 certain that the group is part of the Russian intelligence services Cozy Bear was first identified as being a significant threat actor in 2014 according to the American cybersecurity firm Crowdstrike It describes the group as being  aggressive in its tactics and nothing if not flexible changing tool sets frequently The unit has previously been implicated in  hacking the US Democratic National Committee  DNC during the US Presidential election in 2016 In 2017 it  attacked Norways Labour Party  defence and foreign ministries as well as the countrys national security service The  report includes recommendations that can help protect organisations from cyberattacks  Throughout 2020 APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid19 vaccine development in Canada the United States and the United Kingdom highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid19 vaccines it said UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health On Thursday the UK government also said Russians had almost certainly  sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election  through illicitlyacquired documents We worked very closely with our allies to ensure we would take measures to keep that information safe said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany and we continue to do so and we are aware of those activities What else has the US said by Tara McKelvey in Washington DC The National Security Agency along with our partners remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cybersecurity advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing Covid19 pandemic said NSA cybersecurity director Anne Neuberger  Earlier in 2020 John Demers an assistant attorney general for US national security warned that hackers working for foreign governments were trying to steal vaccine research  He said that the first nation to find a vaccine first will gain clout on the world stage with a significant geopolitical success story For that reason hackers have been pursuing vaccine research in several countries Demers and others who work in US intelligence have been watching their activities closely  Now intelligence experts know more about the goals of the hackers and

link About sharing image copyright PA image caption Emeli Sande JayZ and The Ting Tings We usually hear about phishing attacks in the technology world  when impostors try to scam people out of money by tricking them into handing over their personal details  But now its said the technique has found its way into pop music Producer Richard X says hes received contact from fraudsters disguising themselves as industry workers requesting he sends them music They get a little bit of information by searching databases publishers catalogues or reading forums says X sat in his London studio  Thats enough for them to write a cheeky email disguised as someone from the management touring agency or someone related to the artists in an attempt to get you the producer to send them finished tracks or demos Fandriven Richard X who has worked with Kelis MIA and the original Sugababes puts this recent development down to the actions of techsavvy rabid fans  You might think that someone wouldnt fall for these emails but in a high turnover fast environment which making records is now things are needed instantly Its possible that you would send something explains X I know of a producer recently who did send out the demos and the masters to a random person Online leaks of music traditionally come from a range of sources  everything from the artist passing new music on to a friend to a journalist leaking a promotional copy or even a producer being careless with a storage hard drive  This development comes as many of the collaborations which regularly fill the top 40 have been recorded without the artists ever having been in the same room Instead parts of songs are recorded and exchanged online via email digital lockers or upload sites Earlier this month he tweeted a link to a pop phishing email hed been sent Not to encourage things but it does seem like an interesting way of trying to get hold of these unreleased gems he says The fandriven mentality and rightly so is that they want to hear new things and will do anything to get the exclusive I personally dont think its a big evil piracy network behind it all Sales threat   Whatever the motives Paul Smernicki Head of Digital at Universal Records says its a broad problem his company is increasingly on the look out for  People through the label have been made aware to be vigilant he says With that particular method the intent can only be interpreted as malicious He says music leaking online from his artists Universal  the worlds biggest record label looks after everyone from Lady Gaga to Take That is a relatively frequent occurrence If someone walked up to you in the street dressed as a policeman and tried to get you to do something that would be pretty shocking says Smernicki  The ingenuity is surprising but not the intent He says pop phishing is among the acts of fraudsters who really want to damage an album campaign and that if music fans can get access to tracks for free it could hurt sales Some people lots of people may not go and buy the album he says People invest loads of time energy and emotion into doing their jobs and doing them as well as they possibly can To have the rug pulled out from under is really hard He says security can be an issue and points to JayZ and Kanye Wests Watch The Throne album as an extreme example of artists taking music protection into their own hands  The rappers held tracks on fingerprintprotected hard drives and recorded in popup studios in international hotel rooms  Artists view From it being mastered to it hitting shelves its not unusual for a track or an album to be sat waiting for months  Brits Critics Choice winner Emeli SandÃ© finished her debut album last year but it doesnt get released until 13 February She says she hoped it wouldnt leak but that it feels almost like an inevitability now that someone will find it and it will get out Its a real shame if it affects actual sales SandÃ© told Newsbeat  People dont understand how much work goes into making a record How much time and how hard it is to even get it released I feel quite upset that it happens The Ting Tings second album Sounds From Nowheresville has already appeared online despite not being released until March Multiinstrumentalist with the Salford band Jules de Martino takes a different view  Art should always have a price Im not a big fan of people stealing stuff even if its a penny he explains  But if youre doing your stuff honestly creatively and its good then I think you will stay in the game as long as you can  sales apart If youre doing all right that price comes

link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Theyre exploiting the fear uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldnt have otherwise says Morgan Wright a former senior adviser to the US Department of State antiterrorism assistance programme Hes talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the dark web who have found a new angle  anxiety over Covid19 Mr Wright who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency NSA about the exploitation of human behaviour  He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor The Tor browser is privacyfocused meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it image copyright Morgan Wright image caption Mr Wright used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency NSA What is Tor Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software known as the Tor browser to use it The name is an acronym for The Onion Router Just as there are many layers to the vegetable there are many layers of encryption on the network It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory and continues to receive funding from the US State Department It attempts to hide a persons location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several nodes  which in this context means using volunteers PCs and computer servers as connection points Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity To the website that ultimately receives the request it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain  known as an exit node  rather than the person responsible Since the beginning of the global pandemic marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid19 related products and services Soughtafter N95 masks gowns gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces Last month security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale  Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products and as a result these items are not cheap an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about 370 Â£300 while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between 1015000 Â£812000 One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web  such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles  because these industries are currently dormant  Many criminals also see an opportunity  as the majority of people are working from home there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place  There was suddenly a huge shift on the dark web of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor  More Technology of Business How coronavirus is changing NHS technology The robot assistant that can guess what you want Solar power moves towards a breakthrough step The stealthy drones that fly like insects The secret chemical cocktails behind coronavirus testing Phishing scams have also been on the rise These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data which can then be used to steal money or someones identity  The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding grants or being furloughed says Javvad Malik security advocate at training company KnowBe4 Now there are Covid19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web  meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates he adds In addition many services and products including phishing kits are being offered at discount in coronavirus sales There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years who are now offering discounts because they believe its the best time to make money and spread these kits says Liv Rowley threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv a computer and network security firm image copyright Blueliv image caption Intelligence analyst Liv Rowley monitors dark web scammers The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure anonymous way  While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose  speaking to others anonymously on forums According to Mr Malik these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web he says As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation many others may be pushed onto the dark web These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come  image copyright Javvad Malik image caption Conspiracy theories flourish on the dark web says Javvad Malik The flipside to this is that many journalists activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship Tor versions of many news outlets  including the BBC  and New York Times may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states for instance  Netblocks a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic  including hospitals These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid says Charity Wright cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights The coordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web image copyright IntSights image caption Dark Web scammers are targeting healthcare says Etay Maor We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcarerelated information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors Theres even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff says Etay Maor from IntSights  At its core the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for  from a privacy and security perspective But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain Thats the doubleedged sword that as a society we havent quite worked out how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms says Javvad Malik  Related Topics

up since the global pandemic was declared image copyright Action Fraud image caption Action Fraud has reported a number of scams relating to the sale of fake medical products Guidance issued by the National Cyber Security Centre NCSC has detected more UK government branded scams relating to COVID19 than any other subject since the start of March There are now 2500 they are aware of ranging from fake offers of tax rebates to bogus medicines The organisation says criminals are primarily targeting people with Covid19 related phishing emails  These attempt to make individuals hand over personal or even bank details usually by clicking on a link first A SIMPLE GUIDE   What are the symptoms NEW GUIDANCE  What must I do NEW RESTRICTIONS  What are they LOOKUP TOOL  Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS  Visual guide to the outbreak One particular scam asks Android users to download a coronavirus tracker app to see cases in their area  In fact it installs ransomware  a type of software aimed at stealing information  on the users phone  Emails may spoof organisations such as the World Health Organization WHO or an individual with Dr in their title the NCSC says A known scam purports to be sent on behalf of the government and is offering payments to people as part of its promise to battle Covid19 image copyright Colin Holder image caption Security expert Colin Holder says criminals are likely to be using landlines to target individuals during the crisis The National Crime Agency NCA says fraudsters are adapting their behaviour under lockdown As a response it says it is redoubling its efforts to bring them to justice and is deploying more officers online So far the NCA has taken down six web domains known to be exploiting the virus However one expert believes criminals are also exploiting the fact that people are at home by calling landlines Founder of the Fraud Alert website and former Metropolitan Police detective Colin Holder is one of many security experts who monitor dark web criminal forums for signs of new scamming methods Often criminals will share templates or guides showing how to crack passwords and defraud people He said they would now look to cash in on landline numbers they may have purchased in recent years  They are trading a vast amount of mobile numbers every day but a lot of people now dont answer mobile numbers they dont recognise Mr Holder said If you are at home you are very likely to answer your landline  so we have seen home numbers being traded quite consistently This is the time they will look to use them Criminals never want to spend money but where else can you get someone elses home phone number from now Mr Holder said criminals will often start the call with the home occupants name to lull them into a conversation Then if they have some data from an official source it makes them sound legitimate he added Mr Holder said criminals may not even ask for a bank account  they may be looking for a piece of information that could lead to a password or the answer to a commonly used security question such as mothers maiden name image copyright Sean McGrath image caption Sean McGrath of proprivacycom says the number of malicious websites launched during the crisis has reached 80000 Editor of the proprivacycom website Sean McGrath has compiled a list of newly registered websites linked to phishing scams or considered malicious by security companies since the outbreak In January there were 1772 new URLs registered worldwide In March that jumped to 62771 They include website titles such as childcarecoronacom and heatingincoronacom  Many appear to look legitimate and feature the same wording and branding as the World Health Organisation At the very least the websites are spreading misinformation said Mr McGrath They are part of campaigns that want to spread a message that is disingenuous At the other end these are sites that by getting you to download something are installing malware or ransomware on your computer The criminality is spreading at the same rate as the virus itself Mr McGrath said the websites work by preying on a need for information in a time of crisis Most are sent out as a link in a phishing email How to stay safe Action Fraud has urged people to watch out for scam emails that appear to be from official sources and to research sites before buying goods online  It says you should also always install the latest software and app updates to protect devices from the latest threats For more advice on internet shopping visit the  Action Fraud

caption Watch the moment Mark Telling finds out hes been a victim of fraud A BBC investigation has found criminals are setting up fake businesses on an industrial scale and successfully applying for governmentbacked Covid emergency loans  with no intention of paying the money back They claim up to Â£50000 on each application The Bounce Back Loan Scheme  or BBLS  was announced in April and is designed to help small firms stay afloat during the crisis  The loans are 100 backed by the government and do not have to be paid off for six years They are interest free for the first 12 months and are administered by 12 banks But we have uncovered evidence criminals are taking advantage of the system and could be making millions of pounds  Scandal One fraud expert a retired detective has called it a scandal and said we may never know the true scale of the problem The Treasury insists banks are taking appropriate precautions and the government would take criminal action against the most serious cases The revelations come after the head of the National Audit Office  told the Guardian  the BBLS was the riskiest of all the bailout measures So how does the fraud work Gangs steal victims personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums They then set up a bogus business in their name After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank The rules state the scheme should only apply to firms set up before 1 March 2020   But weve seen successful applications for companies that were created as late as June Free money We met a fraud investigator who has successfully infiltrated a criminal gang online His work is highly sensitive so he asked to remain anonymous He showed us the details of multiple people who had their personal details stolen of businesses set up in their names and Bounce Back Loans applied for Typically the criminals apply for the maximum of Â£50000 The fraud investigator told us it seems to be free money for the scammers There are hundreds possibly thousands of people involved engaged in this Its going to cost us billions he said We also obtained data from Companies House that indicates a sharp increase in the registration of new companies after the BBLS was announced  In early March registrations were running at 15602 per week After lockdown that figure halved to 7571 per week  Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the scheme on 27 April Registrations then rose to a record 21616 by the end of June  We dont know how many of those new companies might be fake  or how many

paid off for 10 years and offer a range of flexible payment options  The  loan scheme is an extension of earlier offers which some businesses complained they could not access as the lending criteria was too strict  The NAO report warned that the speed with which the scheme was rolled out heightened the fraud risk It took a month to ensure businesses could not receive more than one loan  My name was used to steal a government Covid loan Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100000 loan applications on first day The Public Accounts Committee said it was the governments largest and most risky business support scheme  It says it will not assess the valueformoney of the scheme as the loans will not start being paid back until May next year  The NAO analysis said losses from the scheme are likely to reach significantly above normal estimates for publicsector fraud of 05 to 5  The report also said the UKs five biggest banks will make nearly Â£1bn between them from the scheme Taxpayers expense Meg Hillier chair of the Public Accounts Committee said the loans had been a vital lifeline for many businesses  But she added that the government estimates that up to 60 of the loans could turn bad  this would be a truly eyewatering loss of public money  The bounce back loan scheme got money into the hands of small businesses quickly and will have stopped some from going under But the schemes hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayers expense Sadly many firms wont be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem  Analysis Angus Crawford BBC news correspondent  Todays report confirms what many people had suspected   In May the government had to get money to small businesses as quickly as possible before tens of thousands of them went bust   But to do that they had to make compromises on credit and fraud checks  This opened the doors to a whole range of problems  including fraud by organised criminal gangs   Weve found evidence of more than 100 bogus firms set up by scammers to make fraudulent applications  getting the maximum Â£50000 each time   Theyve used the stolen personal details of innocent victims to set up the fake companies  victims who wont know anything about it until the letters demanding repayment start arriving through their doors next summer  How its done  Gangs steal victims personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums  They then set up a bogus business in their name After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank The taxpayer is in the same position  waiting to find out how much the scheme will ultimately cost us  The warning from the National Audit Office is clear  it has the potential to be very high Sue and Dave Burden from the south of England were shocked to find that Sues identity had been stolen to set up a company and claim a bounce back loan  Ive gone from tears to anger she told the BBC Now Im going to be scared to do anything The stateowned British Business Bank BBB which supervises the bounce back loan scheme twice raised concerns firstly in May  The BBB expects it will pay out Â£107bn in interest payments to the high street lenders that provided the cash  Most of this will go to UKs five biggest banks Barclays HSBC Lloyds NatWest and Santander which provided Â£313bn of funding According to latest Treasury figures  there have been 155 million applications for the loans with 126 million approvals We targeted this support to help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we wont apologise for this a government spokesperson said Weve looked to minimise fraud  with lenders implementing a range of protections including antimoney laundering and customer checks as well as transaction monitoring controls  Any fraudulent applications can be criminally prosecuted for which penalties include

sharing image copyright Bella Dorey image caption Bella Dorey says the Instagram hack is gutting and will hit the firm financially This week after seven years of building up thousands of Instagram followers a small company on the south coast of England found its account had been hacked The English Stamp Company tried to let Instagram know But in a response that evening the social media giant said the account had been permanently deleted Were sorry for any inconvenience this causes Instagram which is owned by Facebook said in the automated message Its gutting the fact that its the last seven years of work and its disappointing that Instagram appears unwilling to help says Bella Dorey 27 one of three people in the firm who manage the account Reliant The company which makes rubber stamps was founded in 1992 by Bellas father and mother Jon and Sasha and has seven employees It had built up nearly 29000 followers on its Instagram account and was hoping to get to 30000 by Christmas It uses Instagram as its main marketing tool and was relying on the social media platform to boost Christmas sales especially as coronavirus has put a stop to the usual exhibitions the company uses to showcase its wares Travelex strikes rescue deal but 1300 UK jobs go Blackbaud Hack Universities lose data to ransomware attack We are going to suffer a loss financially says Bella How do you put a value on more than 28000 followers Hack and demands On Tuesday the company got a message from Instagram saying there had been an unusual login to its account from a computer in Huddersfield The BBC verified with a computer security expert that this message was genuine Bella and a colleague immediately tried to get in contact with Instagram but just four minutes later they got an email from the hackers who called themselves Carlo Minhift image copyright Westend61 Good Day We apologize for the inconvenience Your account has been temporarily blocked the email said The hackers said they would wait two hours then start clearing the account by deleting photos if Bella and her colleagues did not respond The next day the hackers revealed their intention had been to extort money from the small firm But they were too late Instagram had already deleted the account We didnt want to ruin your account but you dont respond to us We realized that you will not pay us No not really We apologize for not being convenient but we unfortunately start clearing the account after 30 minutes and sell it See you later the hackers said Target Attacks on Instagram users while rarer than other forms of cyber attack are becoming increasingly common as a growing number of influencers and companies market themselves on the platform according to Professor Alan Woodward a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey He said the decision of the English Stamp Company not to engage with the hackers was brave but he said it was the right one You shouldnt pay the ransom he said Theres no guarantee youll get the account back the money will be used to fund further crime and youll just paint a big target on your back as a payer Quite a lot of attacks of this nature rely on socalled  phishing emails  which try to trick users into revealing sensitive information like usernames and passwords by posing as a reputable website Credential stuffing is another ploy used by hackers who use personal data harvested elsewhere to gain unauthorised access to accounts The best way to deal with an Instagram attack is to try to preempt it by beefing up your security beforehand Professor Woodward said Make sure passwords are strong and dont reuse them across sites he added Instagram offers twofactor authentication by sending a code to your phone People can check whether their usernames or passwords have been breached through a website called  haveibeenpwnedcom  which is run by Troy Hunt a Microsoft security expert Facebook says Instagram is working with The English Stamp Company to try to recover their account as soon as possible Businesses are an important part of our community and we take their safety and security seriously the company said We notify people if we see any unauthorised changes to an account and in the few instances hacking occurs people can recover accounts through the app and website Has your business Instagram account been hacked What was the impact on your firm

sharing  From caravans to kitchen tables and podcast production to pregnancy Ive been speaking to many women in and around the technology sector about how they have adapted to the challenges of working during the coronavirus pandemic  Research suggests women across the world have shouldered more family and household responsibilities than men as the coronavirus pandemic continues alongside their working lives And they share their inspirations frustrations but also their optimism I have a new business and a new life says Clare Muscutt who lost work her relationship and her flatmate as lockdown hit  This Tuesday is Ada Lovelace Day  an annual celebration of women working in the maledominated science technology engineering and maths Stem sectors And this year it has a very different vibe Varsha Amin technology and digital skills coach Hampshire image copyright Shadzig  Initially it felt like business was paused Confidence went  Ive now gone fully online The tech is there to support it And weirdly I think Ive benefited from it Im booking up months ahead  The digital skills gap is costing the economy billions People and even entire corporations are so far behind  Then you add in the complication of Covid And you think everything is going to go backwards But actually digital is growing exponentially  Im dyslexic so I have relied on tech to help get me where I am today Im a firm believer that tech can really enable anyone from anywhere to start their own business and make it fly My husband is a neuroscientist When Covid first hit he was redeployed to the front line And we had no childcare  There were days when I sat in front of my laptop and cried Getting the right balance is difficult In September my daughter started school In the future when she becomes more independent I will go all out on my business Jess Ratty  entrepreneur technology publicrelations company founder Cornwall image copyright Jess Ratty There is absolutely no doubt that this has been the hardest year of my life  I lost 40 of my business in two days at the start of lockdown  I had worked so hard to get to where I had got to And I was filled with fury that a pandemic had taken it away Every pitch we get I throw as much energy at the screen as possible  I find myself working longer hours to be more visible to my clients  I am driven by this fear that next week I could lose another couple But I have now got 60 more business back in Im used to working from home But the biggest problem was having my eightyearold daughter suddenly with me 247 when the schools closed  We all knew it might come But when it did it happened so fast It was really difficult having to work and do childcare at the same time  Before lockdown I would have said it was impossible Im embarrassed to say that she spent a lot of time watching Netflix and Disney But I am the breadwinner And my partner was working full time on our house renovation because until it was finished we were living in a static caravan Im now launching a new business this time in edtech education technology Im looking to do as many things as possible to protect those closest to me and prepare for the next impossible thing to happen  Clare Muscutt digital customer experience entrepreneur Essex image copyright willowdesignstudio What I used to do doesnt exist anymore  I had the life and career of my dreams And I had left the corporate world to do it  As soon as the pandemic hit my diary just emptied  The clients I had work booked with shut down any unnecessary spend  Then my relationship ended My best friend moved out of our flat And suddenly the only contact I had with others was through Zoom  I started having conversations with women in a similar field to me And we started sharing how we were feeling It made me think How can I bring this style of conversation to the world to help inspire others And that led me into podcasting  After a bad experience I taught myself how to do the production And it has led to me being paid to interview tech leaders elsewhere  My bills are now getting paid And the podcast is helping me to form an online community Before the pandemic I was living for the future  always looking forward to the next big event or trip away Now I dont know what the future holds or whether things will ever go back to the way they were But if they dont its OK  I have a new business and a new life Rebecca cybersecurity specialist Ireland I have worked from home before And at the start of lockdown I didnt think it would be that much of a big deal But it turned out that working from the kitchen table was very uncomfortable Eventually I finally got an old desk from a friend And I was so happy  Since lockdown began Ive seen quite a few cybersecurity issues with phishing and invoice redirection  when a malicious actor gets hold of a legitimate invoice and resends it but changes the bank details  Sometimes its small amounts here and there sometimes large amounts  Its often difficult to recover the money Im also four months pregnant with our first child I need new clothes But if you go to the shop you cant try anything on And I have no idea what size I am Plus I am limited in the times I can go out I dont drive It has to fit around work And we cant go at busy times because standing in long queues is so exhausting  I feel like Ive lost my independence  In addition they havent yet figured out how they are going to hold antenatal classes  I feel like I wont meet any other parents until my kid starts school Claire Broadley technical writer Leeds image copyright Mathew Dixon Before lockdown my husband and I ran our own company producing user guides and written content for websites Business income dropped by about twothirds during lockdown  We werent eligible for any government grants And because we still had a small amount of work we couldnt furlough ourselves  It felt like we were slowly marching our family towards a cliff edge  In May to my astonishment and relief I was offered my dream job remote writing about the internet and technology Working from home with the children has been the most difficult thing weve ever done  My son is seven He is very scared  Sometimes we cant spend the time with him that we would like to And most screentime rules have gone completely out of the window  The real issue for us now is testing  My young daughter caught Covid in July And she recently had a temperature again But it took six days to get a test result so my son was off school again And my husband was working until midnight to fit

Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Fraudsters are using the pandemic as an excuse to trick people out of their cash according to British banks UK Finance has warned that scamsters are preying on consumers financial fears and has named ten Covid19 scams the public should be wary of Criminals are impersonating trusted organisations like the NHS or HMRC to trick people the trade body said People should stay alert to avoid falling for the sophisticated schemes it said During this pandemic we have seen criminals using sophisticated methods to callously exploit peoples financial concerns to trick them into giving away their money or information said Katy Worobec managing director of economic crime at UK Finance Local councils have recorded a 40 increase in reported scams since the start of lockdown while Citizens Advice reckons one in three people have been targeted by a Covid scammer Taxpayers to lose billions to virus fraud  report Scam warning over NHS test and trace Fake lockdown fines among scams targeting public Some scams manipulate their victims by urging people to invest and take advantage of the financial downturn  Others impersonate wellknown subscription services to trick people to part with their cash and personal information Some criminals even pose as representatives from the NHS test and trace service to fool people into giving away their personal details We urge people to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign to keep their money and personal information safe from fraudsters said Ms Worobec The campaign encourages people to be suspicious of any unsolicited contact and Stop Challenge and Protect when they receive any messages out of the blue The ten scams to be wary of Covid19 financial support scams 1 Fake government emails which look like they are from government departments offering grants of up to Â£7500 The emails contain links which steal personal and financial information 2 Scam emails offering access to Covid19 relief funds which encourage victims to fill in a form and hand over their personal information 3 Officiallooking emails offering a council tax reduction The emails contain links that lead to a fake government website which harvests personal and financial information 4 Benefit recipients are offered help in applying for universal credit but fraudsters grab some of the payment as an advance for their services Health scams 5 Phishing emails claiming that the recipient has been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid19 They lead to fake websites that are used to steal personal and financial information or infect devices with malware 6 Fake adverts for nonexistent coronavirusrelated products such as hand sanitizer and face masks which simply take the victims cash and send them nothing Lockdown scams 7 Fake emails and texts claiming to be from TV Licensing telling people they are eligible for six months for free because of the pandemic Victims are told there has been a problem with their direct debit and are asked to click on a link that takes them to a fake website which steals their personal and financial information 8 Emails asking people to update their TV subscription services payment details by clicking on a link which is then used to steal credit card information 9 Fake profiles on social media sites are used to manipulate victims into handing over their money Criminals will often use the identities of real people to strike up conversation with their targets  10 Fake investment opportunities are advertised on social media sites encouraging victims to take advantage of the financial downturn Bitcoin platforms are using emails and adverts on social media platforms to encourage unsuspecting victims to put money into fake companies using fake websites Be cautious The Local Government Association LGA also warned about fake coronavirus test kits and hand sanitizers but said scamsters are also flogging medical products claiming to treat or prevent Covid19 It said local councils have also heard of messages about how to claim school meals funding and government grants and criminals coldcalling care home residents offering to do shopping errands One scam involves a message sent by text or email stating that the recipient has been fined Â£60 for leaving their home more than once a day the LGA warned Links in these messages connect to websites that steal a victims personal information or hack into their computer or phone People need to be cautious If something doesnt seem right or sounds too good to be true dont hesitate to end a phone call bin a letter delete an email or shut the door an LGA spokesperson said Citizens Advice warned that the most vulnerable people are often at greater risk of being contacted by a scammer Dame Gillian Guy chief executive of Citizens Advice said While so many people have pulled together to help and support each other through the challenges of coronavirus opportunistic scammers have instead chosen to prey on unsuspecting victims Weve had nearly a quarter of a million views of our web pages on scams during this pandemic and were urging everyone to only use trusted sources of information and be on the lookout for signs of a potential scam The charitys research showed almost half those with a disability or longterm illness had been targeted while half of those with an increased risk of Covid19 or those shielding had been too More than half of those who have lost personal income due to the virus had also been contacted Related

2019 comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption NCSC staff protect the UK from cyberattacks from their office in central London An attempt to defraud thousands of people using a bogus email from a UK airport was one of a range of cyberattacks prevented last year The scam used a fake govuk address but the messages were prevented from ever reaching their intended recipients The details were revealed by GCHQs  National Cyber Security Centre in an annual report  In all NCSC disclosed it had stopped 140000 separate phishing attacks This refers to the attempted online theft of bank details and other sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy person or organisation In addition the agency said it had taken down 190000 fraudulent sites  This often happened quickly The centre said that 64 of illegal sites were offline within 24 hours of being discovered and 993 eventually went dark This is the second time NCSC has published a progress report for its Active Cyber Defence programme The effort  which uses a mix of automated processes to defeat internetbased threats to the UK  was launched in late2016 One focus is to take down malware and phishing sites This is normally done by finding out who hosts the websites involved and then telling them that their clients are running a criminal operation Most providers take down the pages quickly although there are some exceptions   No such address NCSC has not shared the name of the airport the fraudsters attempted to impersonate last August But it did say that the failed scheme involved sending 200000 emails to members of the public asking them to pay a fee in order to receive a larger refund  Had the intended victims paid the sum they would have got nothing in return UK cybersecurity efforts criticised by audit office UK cybercentre thwarts hostile hackers UK moves to active cyberdefence The security centre also took the criminals real email address offline to ensure they could not receive any replies Another success was an apparent reduction in the number of attacks in which fraudsters had posed as HM Revenue and Customs Scammers often pretend to offer individuals tax refunds if victims provide bank accounts and a facilitation payment   At the start of January 2016 HMRC was the 16th most popular disguise used in phishing emails By the end of 2019 a series of new measures had reduced its global ranking to 146th Address book block Efforts were also made to prevent 14 million employees in the public sector from visiting malicious sites  This involved a service  known as PDNS protective domain name system  which effectively refuses to query the internets address book when appropriate So for example if a user typed in a web address whose domain name had previously been linked to illegal activity   eg dodgysitecom  the service would refuse to provide the related internet protocol address  eg 21658111789  required to connect to its computer servers NCSC said that PDNS had handled a total of 687 billion queries in 2018 of which it had blocked 574 million  image copyright Getty Images image caption The PDNS system prevents connections to computer servers that are known to host ransomware phishing attacks and malicious sites This included frustrating 450000 queries related to WannaCry  the malware that took down parts of the NHS in 2018 A further 230000 queries were obstructed relating to another piece of malware called BadRabbit The system even found evidence  of attempts to spread the Conficker worm  which was released as far back as 2008 NCSC added that BT has been working on its own version of PDNS and is blocking an average of 110 million malicious connections per month Weather centre Other incidents flagged by the report included a primary school being involved in the spread of a largescale malware infection because its antivirus system was not working an unnamed public sector organisation that deals with sensitive information getting breached because its employees had downloaded unauthorised software at least 318 public sector networks still routinely using Windows XP despite Microsoft having pulled nearly all support for the operating system in 2014 In the future the NCSC said it wanted to do more to map the UKs use of the internet in a piece of research it calls the Internet Weather Centre  The aim is to understand questions like what are the most commonly used cloud services and then use that knowledge to understand related vulnerabilities  It also wants to do more work to allow public sector users to scan and check how their infrastructure is exposed to the net to spot potential risks View comments Related Topics Fraud Cybercrime Cybersecurity Cyberattacks GCHQ More

officers against a US political party and its leaders  is or at least should be equally inflammatory The wreckage of what Robert Muellers team says were Russian strikes on the US can be measured in

sharing There are a lot of unanswered questions about the Twitter hack on Wednesday night  but one thing most agree on is it could have been far worse  Potentially thousands of people were scammed out of money after hijacked accounts of prominent verified users promised to double the money fans sent them in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin  Using Twitters internal systems the cybercriminals messages had a reach of at least 350 million people And it looks like it made them about 110000 Â£86800 in the few hours that the scam was active Huge engagement It was an unprecedented attack on privacy trust and security  But experts say the hackers could have caused far more damage As the boss of a smaller messaging service put it Thank God for greed Twitter has huge engagement in the US Japan Russia and the UK  Valid questions It is the platform of choice for some of the most powerful and prominent people in the world  Their posts have moved financial markets and caused diplomatic incidents With the US presidential election less than four months away there are now valid questions to be asked about whether Twitter can be relied upon in the lead up to the vote President Donald Trumps account was not taken over in the hack Favourite tools But many were watching to see if it would fall after his Democrat rival Joe Bidens account tweeted out the scam image caption Presidential hopefuls Mike Bloomberg who had sought the Democratic nomination and Kanye West who has said he will run as an independent were among those hacked We already know Russia is planning to meddle in the 2020 election just as they did in the 2016 election Dr Heather Williams from Kings College London said Socialmedia manipulation is one of their favourite tools So this hack shows just how vulnerable socialmedia platforms are and how vulnerable Americans are to disinformation  If something bigger was at stake such as the presidency this could have really disastrous consequences and undermine our democratic processes Worst in history The security implications of the hack are also widereaching not just for Twitter but for all social networks Early suggestions are the hackers managed to access administration privileges which allowed them to bypass the passwords of any account they wanted Twitter appeared  to confirm this in a tweet saying  We detected what we believe to be a coordinated socialengineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools image caption Celebrities including US boxer Floyd Mayweather and the singer Wiz Khalifa also lost control of their accounts Socialengineering could mean one of several things Go rogue It might imply a targeted phishing operation  a common tactic employed by cybercriminals who find out which individuals have the keys to a system they want to enter and then target them with personal emails that trick them into handing over details Or it might mean the perpetrators managed to convince one or several staff members to go rogue by offering a financial inducement or other means Major US Twitter accounts hacked in Bitcoin scam The Benjamin Netanyahu Twitter hack that never was The technology company is going to face huge pressure to be more specific Twitters reputation is the cost of this cyberattack World Economic Forum cyber lead William Dixon said This is a major security breach for Twitter  The worst in its history More cyberresilience is needed across the ecosystem to be able to protect social media users around the world Sensitive information Twitter is not answering reporters questions directly but said it had taken significant steps to limit access to internal systems while it investigated The company also said it was looking into what other malicious activity the hackers may have conducted or information they may have accessed The chief executive of the messaging service Element has raised the possibility confidential data was also exposed Its highly likely private direct messages were accessible for a short time Matthew Hodgson said Next time harvesting sensitive information could fuel a wave of extortion or something much worse image caption Technology companies Apple and Uber have more than 55 million Twitter followers between them The idea Twitter has the ability to take over peoples accounts no matter what security they have may shock some But experts say it is a necessary part of any membershipbased service Facebook Snapchat Instagram and YouTube have been approached for comment on their security arrangements  None has responded Highrisk accounts But Facebooks former chief security officer Alex Stamos told BBC News all consumerfacing companies needed a way to be able to help consumers recover hacked or otherwise lockedout accounts The change that can be made here is that Twitter can restrict this ability for highrisk accounts to a much smaller number of users or create tools that require one person to initiate and another to approve the change he said This is apparently what they have already done for President Trumps account following an incident in 2017  They will need to vastly expand these protections Lost control Beyond a potential loss of trust Twitter may now face legal consequences too The EUs General Data Protection Regulation GDPR says organisations such as Twitter have to show appropriate levels of security And if dataprotection officers judge Twitter failed to take adequate measures to protect European users it could be fined Earlier this year the companys

close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images A man shot dead by officers on Sunday during what police called an Islamistrelated terrorist incident had been out of prison for about a week So what is done in prisons to deradicalise people like  Sudesh Amman who stabbed people on Streatham High Street What do we know of Ammans past  Amman 20 served half of a sentence of three years and four months for terror offences He pleaded guilty in November 2018 to six charges of possessing documents containing information useful to terrorists  and seven of passing them on The documents included a manual on knife fighting  Before he was jailed Amman had convictions for having a broken bottle as an offensive weapon and possessing cannabis Whats done to deradicalise terror offenders  A programme called Healthy Identities Intervention HII is the UKs main inprison scheme to challenge the thinking of terrorism offenders  After the 2019 Fishmongers Hall attack the creator of the 10yearold scheme forensic psychologist Chris Dean told the BBC  there is no certainty all terrorism offenders can be reformed It aims to get offenders to think carefully often over a very long series of counselling sessions why they chose to turn to terrorist violence They are asked whether the violence or support of it defines their identity  image copyright Met Police image caption Amman had previous convictions for having an offensive weapon and possessing cannabis In some cases an offender may turn away from violence quickly But it is often more difficult when prisoners who have spent years in jail or supporting banned organisations are involved In the case of those aligned to jihadist organisations prison service imams also get involved in religious counselling sessions These have been criticised for using chaplains without the detailed knowledge of jihadist ideology required to break down extremist beliefs  How many prisoners take part In theory every prisoner convicted of a terrorismrelated crime is eligible to attend HII sessions or similar schemes  Some refuse to cooperate and others may not need specialist intervention because they have found their own way to change for the better  It is not clear whether the prison service has sufficient resources in place for all the prisoners who may want to take part  Prof Andrew Silke another expert in the field said last year there were waiting lists and  some offenders never get seen before their release date How many people are in prison for terror offences Who was the Streatham attacker Why do prisoners serve only half their sentence How successful are these programmes  We dont know Mr Dean told the BBC that HII had seen successes However there were also hard cases because of the psychological hold that other extremists or an ideology had over the life of an inmate  The HII programme has not been independently evaluated One reason is it would be unethical to carry out a scientific trial in which some offenders are released without receiving therapy just to see if they were most likely to reoffend  In 2015 the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove asked Ian Acheson a former prison governor to review how extremism was being handled Mr Acheson concluded that the system was full of flaws  How often do convicts pose a danger after release  This is the second time that a convicted terrorism offender has come out of jail and carried out an attack leading to their death at the hands of armed police  Usman Khan was shot dead by police  after he killed two people and injured three others in Decembers attack  at Fishmongers Hall London Bridge  The police have successfully caught other suspects who continue to plot after their release  including  a cell in Birmingham who were uncovered planning a marauding knife attack in the city  What do other countries do  Some nations separate Islamist extremist prisoners in jails to prevent radicalisation   The Acheson review found that in the Netherlands Spain and France the separation of extremist offenders had worked well It had improved prison safety and order That in turn had helped the authorities to better target counterradicalisation schemes at those who would most benefit  The UK only recently began operating socalled separation units for the highest risk detainees However there have been reports of disagreement within the prison service over whether they are being properly used Saudi Arabia claims to have had the most success targeting 3300 inmates since 2005 The authorities there claim an 80 success rate  with the remaining 20 returning to violence  The offenders go through a number of stages  Counselling in prison before entering a specialist rehabilitation facility Intensive cognitive behaviour programmes  aimed at addressing the way they think and respond to situations Introduction to a wider range of art cultural sporting and religious activities to help them return to normal life and society After care once they are back in society Related Topics Antiterror legislation Prisons Crime More on this story How many people are in prison for terror offences Published 6

CBS image caption Dogmauling victim Bethany Stephens was found dead in Virginia In Virginia US a young woman has died in tragic circumstances after being mauled by her own dogs Police said Bethany Stephens 22 was attacked by her two pit bulls while out for a walk  despite having raised them since they were puppies Locals were so shocked by the case that the sheriff had to release disturbing details of her death  to convince them the dogs were responsible What would make a dog turn on its owner so dramatically  Experts say its still unclear But generally speaking there are several factors that make dogs lash out Here are some to be aware of They dont like stress or Christmas Sean Wensley Senior Veterinary Surgeon at the Peoples Dispensary for Sick Animals PDSA says dogs can be aggressive when they feel threatened The motivation for lots of dog bites is fear he says Others are territorial  if theyre guarding something that they highly value or defending their favourite resting place their bed Or if theyve learned to defend say a dog bowl  that can result in aggression Dog behaviourist and trainer Carolyn Menteith notes that many dog bites occur during the holiday season and often its not their owner they snap with Christmas can make it worse as people ask people to just stay with their dog while they pop to the shops she says A houseful of guests descend excited children are around all day and walks may fall by the wayside leaving the dog bored and confused image copyright Getty Images image caption Christmas can be a confusing time for our canine companions picture for representation Were a very verbal species so when were not feeling comfortable we say something Ms Menteith says Our dogs only have body language cues to do that with Its easy to miss what theyre trying to tell us especially with a long list of undone Christmas chores  Look for signs of pain Regardless of the time of year owners with more than one dog should check how they behave to each other If theres competitive behaviour between them that can lead to aggression between the dogs that can potentially be directed at an owner Dr Wensley says   A generally pleasant dog is more likely to attack if its in pain  for example if its encouraged to move out of a doorway and that tweaks a painful joint image copyright Getty Images image caption Dogs can be aggressive because theyre scared  and may even go and hide after biting people file picture shows a dog in training Liver disease  which affects the brain  and brain tumours can also cause animals to behave unpredictably Mind the children NHS figures for 201415 showed that 7227 people needed medical attention after being bitten or struck by a dog with young children the most commonly affected Some 1159 under the age of nine were admitted to hospital Research published in the British Medical Journal BMJ found that 76 of dog bites to children were to the lips nose or cheeks  because of their height Bites to the neck are especially dangerous as a child can bleed to death if their carotid artery is severed Dr Wensley says children are potentially alarming for inexperienced dogs A small human who behaves slightly unusually who maybe squeals and tries to cuddle them pick them up wave their hands can make them quite fearful he says  Woman 80 jailed over dog attack Dog attack powers not being used How effective is the UKs Dangerous Dogs Act Before biting dogs will usually show several signs of anxiety They may lick their lips adopt a low posture put their ears back and potentially have their tail under their legs Children may be unable to read those signals  and many even think a dog baring its teeth is smiling media caption Katy Hastings reports Ms Menteith says that when a dog does attack the owner will often say it bit with no warning But in its own way the dog has been trying to say something for months We take dogs into our lives and then we dont listen to them as dogs she says Training is a good investment When thinking about whether its safe to leave your dog with children or adult strangers consider its past experiences Is it used to small people Can you really trust it to behave without you A problem we see is when young puppies arent exposed to everyday sights and sounds Dr Wensley says Perhaps theyve been reared on a puppy farm in the middle of nowhere or in a very rural location and then someone buys them off the internet meets them at a motorway services and theyre taken to an urban family environment and expected to understand the world they find themselves in  They can be extremely anxious and fearful and that will manifest as aggression  Early training is also key to avoiding future aggression  and its best to start while theyre still

are concerned in the Police Federation  That is the level of violence and determination that these animals have gone to And this is something we can not tolerate Analysis Tom Symonds BBC Home Affairs Correspondent At times there were as few as 50 police officers facing 100 or more violent protesters Horses and dogs were used to great effect but their numbers have been cut in the last decade  This means that arguably the police were outnumbered  To arrest one protester during the pandemic it currently takes an average of three officers and one vehicle since suspects have to be kept socially distanced   However public order commanders know that sending in snatch squads to make arrests also leads to a more violent response   So instead of clearing the streets and making arrests a decision was taken for police to hold their ground and gather evidence for later investigations   The result has given a dangerous impression  A feeling of a loss of control which was also a feature of the early stages of the 2011 riots in England   Workers from Bristol Waste spent the morning removing broken glass debris and offensive graffiti from the streets  Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the violence had made people already dealing with inequality in the city less safe and questioned whether the perpetrators were from Bristol or were protest tourists He said Smashing buildings in our city centre vandalising vehicles attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through  On the contrary the lawlessness on show will be used as evidence and promote the need for the bill This is a shameful day in an incredible year for Bristol These people should feel shame image copyright Colin Moody image caption Police riot shields and vans were sprayed with graffiti Sue Mountstevens Avon and Somersets police and crime commissioner said the behaviour was completely unacceptable She said Its disgraceful these men and women who started their days expecting a normal day of policing have all returned battered and bruised These people have shown reckless disregard of the lives and safety of our communities in central Bristol and our officers Cause chaos Whether you agree or disagree with the bill these men and women did not deserve to face the level of violence directed at them Nothing can justify such actions University student Rhianna Prewitt who attended the demonstration said This is a symptom of not allowing organisers to actually properly organise protests and by doing that extremists and people who are looking for a riot are going to take advantage to cause chaos Also if the government doesnt want us to protest during the pandemic why are they pushing through a significant law at this time without public scrutiny media caption Protesters clashed with police and threw fireworks into the crowd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the disorder was inexcusable and those involved should be identified and prosecuted where appropriate  He condemned the lawlessness by people who were intent on violence adding parallels could not be drawn between the protests in London against harassment and violence against women and the

sharing image copyright Dan KitwoodGetty Images image caption A Great White Shark pictured in Gansbaai South Africa Apparently if youre attacked by a shark it helps to have read the news Fortunately for surfer Charlie Fry  when a 2m 65ft long shark launched at him on a beach near Sydney he remembered a famous survival story  The source  Australian pro surfer Mick Fanning who punched a shark in the back live on TV during a competition in South Africa Both men were lucky enough to escape with their lives But is punching the predator really the best way out of that situation  We got some expert advice on how to survive a shark attack  Worstcase scenario If the shark decides youre prey Ryan Johnson is a shark researcher and documentary maker who studies great whites He told the BBC it depends if the animal is checking you out or has gone in for the kill  From my experience freediving with white sharks  if youre in that situation where you are getting attacked you have to do everything in your power he said Punching him in the face going for his eyes try to keep your hands out of his mouth  If you start touching them around the snout they can pick up your electroreceptions and they know youre possibly edible He advises using something hard  be it a camera a stick a rock  to push the animal away  In a situation where you dont have that going for the face and the gills and trying to keep your hands out of its mouth is always the best thing media caption Surfer Mick Fanning I punched the shark in the back What if it hasnt attacked yet If theres a shark nearby surely the best thing is to get away as fast as possible Actually no  The worst thing is to try to run away Mr Johnson advises Its like throwing a stick for a dog Fleeing often can entice a shark Standing your ground and trying to make yourself big and going vertical in the water is always the best response to make a shark keep its distance from you Should you carry knives or sticks Conservationist and wildlife author Richard Peirce who lives between Africa and the UK has had many sharks approach closer than I was happy with and agrees the best deterrent is a shove to the nose from a heavy object  perhaps a camera or a shark billy  basically a sharpened stick about two or three feet long Surfer Mick Fanning in another shark scare Australia brings in drones to protect swimmers Woman picks up shark in Australia rescue What about a knife Gosh no Hopeless hopeless he says All youre going to do is excite the animal Youve got a little knife four six eight inches long and youve got a two or three or four metre white shark or a three or four metre tiger shark Theres no chance whatsoever of fighting the shark And if you do start it bleeding you could well attract other animals in  Doesnt really bear thinking about But theres safety in numbers right Absolutely If youre diving in sharkinhabited waters make sure youre in a pair That way if a shark shows up you can keep the animal in sight  The shark is an apex predator Mr Peirce notes Its an ambush predator If they know that youre watching they will circle you  and thats happened to me loads of times  but what you do basically is try to slowly swim back together  So once again despite every instinct  dont panic dont splash   image copyright Science Photo Library image caption Tiger sharks are curious animals and can be found in warm shallow waters A great white doesnt want a mouthful of wetsuit and sinew  were not on the menu its just curiosity Sharks exhibit body language just like a dog You know when that dogs starting to growl bare its teeth  and its exactly the same with a shark When that happens youve got to be calm   And the worst time and place to swim Dont swim at dawn or dusk Mr Peirce advises Those are the times that sharks can make mistakes And those are also prime hunting times  And you wouldnt swim in an estuary situation Bull sharks live in fresh water and sea water You wouldnt swim anywhere near a fishing boat because they could be discarding guts and bits of old fish  all of which will bring in sharks and put them in feeding mode  media caption A British man has told 5 live Breakfast how he swam over four miles to safety after being followed by a tiger shark So how risky is it really There are over 400 species of shark and around a dozen are considered highly dangerous to humans  chiefly the great white tiger shark and bull shark The chances of dying in a shark attack are definitely extremely slim  The Florida Museum of Natural History puts the odds of a fatal attack at about 1 in 3748067   But of course the risk depends on your habits   surfers are obviously more likely to run into a fin than those who rarely set foot in the sea as Surfercom estimated     It also depends where you are The coasts of South Africa Brazil Hawaii and Fiji are all shark territory while in the US Florida and California are most affected There have been 18 shark attacks  including one fatal incident  in Australia this year according to the  Australian Shark Attack File   But overall sharks are at much greater risk from humans than we are from them  Some estimates suggest an astonishing 100 million die due to human activity every year   or around 11000 an hour Related Topics Animals Shark attacks Sharks More on this story UK doctor punches shark in

About sharing Related Topics Syrian civil war image copyright Reuters image caption Experts confirmed that the nerve agent Sarin was used in an attack in the Ghouta in 2013 A week after they gathered in Syria inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are finally gaining access to the site of an alleged chemical attack in the town of Douma Rescue workers and opposition activists say government aircraft dropped barrel bombs filled with toxic chemicals on Douma on 7 April killing more than 40 people and injuring hundreds more  Medics reported seeing patients with symptoms including foaming at the mouth blue skin and lips corneal burns and convulsions which they said indicated exposure to chlorine and possibly a nerve agent  The government and its ally Russia said the incident was staged but requested that an OPCW FactFinding Mission investigate the allegations media caption Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack For the inspectors getting into Douma is the first hurdle When they arrive they will face many more How do you gather evidence of a chemical weapon attack almost a fortnight after it happened in an environment controlled by forces accused of perpetrating the alleged attack The inspectors will be looking for three types of evidence environmental biomedical and documentary said Hamish de Bretton Gordon a British chemical weapons expert who has investigated previous attacks in Syria Environmental evidence could include debris from munitions as well as soil samples and chips of concrete from buildings Biomedical evidence includes blood hair and urine from victims Documentary evidence  witness testimony footage and social media posts What we know about the chemical attack Why is there a war in Syria If they find any weapon debris they will be swabbing it for samples Mr de BrettonGordon said They will be interviewing as many people as they can and attempting to verify the veracity of those witnesses And they will be trying to find the injured and the dead That was key he said  the injured and the dead Biomedical samples provide the most reliable evidence of the use of chemical agents  Urine can be good for identifying the presence of chlorine he said And blood samples will show the presence of a nerve agent as will hair image copyright CBS image caption CBS News found a yellow gas canister on the roof of a building allegedly targeted in Douma The nerve agent Sarin was used in an attack that killed hundreds of people in the Ghouta region outside Damascus in August 2013 In that case OPCW experts gained access to the affected areas after two days as part of a UN mission They collected a significant amount of biomedical evidence from survivors as well as environmental samples  Angela Kane a former UN high representative for disarmament affairs led the mission What we found in Ghouta was a very complex composite of Sarin Ms Kane said In its very pure form Sarin evaporates very quickly making it hard to detect But in 2013 the Sarin was cut with other chemicals which meant that it stayed a lot longer on the ground Finding proof of the allegations made by the residents of Douma may be more difficult On Tuesday the US state department warned that the delays in getting the OPCW inspectors into the town would further degrade any evidence on the ground  Russian military personnel are believed to have visited the attack site last week as rebel fighters were being evacuated The US ambassador to the OPCW said he feared they might have tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW FactFinding Mission Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied any interference media caption Seth Doane CBS visits the scene of the chemical attack in Douma In theory if you wanted to clean up a chemical attack site the first thing to do would be to locate and remove any debris from the munitions Mr de BrettonGordon said Then you would scrub down and clean anything contaminated by the chemical agents Counterintuitively a chlorinebased solution is often used You might also attempt to silence or remove witnesses from the location  A Guardian newspaper report  on Wednesday suggested that medics in Douma had been threatened and had their WhatsApp conversations inspected Another source of evidence is the dead Under the Chemical Weapons Convention OPCW inspectors should have access to any piece of evidence they want including corpses But first the bodies have to be found If the inspectors find no bodies that tells you something Mr de BrettonGordon said If those bodies have disappeared that would be a very strong indication that something was very wrong In Douma investigators will need to perform all of this work in an environment controlled by Syrian government and Russian forces Filming everything as the work was carried out was key said Ms Kane as well as tightly securing any evidence Those samples have to remain in your custody at all times she said You never let them leave your sight wherever you are onto the plane all the way to the the laboratory Related Topics Syria Syrian civil war Syria

sharing image caption The Demon Sheep ad rapidly gained notoriety Its less than a month until the US midterm elections and that means adverts that knock the opposition are coming thick and fast But do the attack ads work and what makes a good one Attack ads are not a uniquely American institution but many of the most powerful examples have come from the US  Lyndon Johnsons  campaign advert Daisy  despite only being shown once played a part in his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in 1964  Its ominous invocation of the dangers of nuclear war generated controversy But nearly five decades on many political scientists believe that negative advertising works It can complement positive advertising at different stages of a campaign Early in the campaign you will see a lot of positive advertising as a candidate introduces himself says Prof Stephen Ansolabehere of Harvard University and coauthor of Going Negative How Political Advertising Alienates and Polarizes the American Electorate Whats then left is to try and discredit the other guy Later in the campaign you see them trying to call attention to the failings  It could be issues it could be scandals The Daisy ad from 1964 didnt even mention Johnsons opponent It was left to the viewer to infer that the meaning was that Goldwaters policies could lead to cataclysm media caption Republican California Senate candidate Carly Fiorinas most notable attack on incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer was a seven minute web movie The crop of 2010 are usually quicker to name the target  Those attack ads that are intended for television are often only 30 seconds long  They can target the private life or moral rectitude of the opponent Louisiana congressman Charlie Melancon decided to take this tack in  an advert against incumbent Senator David Vitter   In July 2007 Mr Vitters phone number cropped up in phone records linked to a Washington DC brothel Mr Vitter apologised for a very serious sin but would give no further details Mr Melancons advert  in the style of a truecrime TV show  returns to these and subsequent allegations But this can be a dangerous type of attack even in todays brutal political arena I can imagine there are consultants who say your opponent is an adulterer or your opponent is a witch we have to hammer that home says Prof Michael Franz of Bowdoin College coauthor of Campaign Advertising and American Democracy  That is where the political scientists would say that is dangerous waters Voters sometimes dont like that style of attack and they could punish the sponsor of it  And attacks on the views of the opponent also have the possibility to backfire One of the most controversial ads of the runup to the midterms so far is Florida Democrat congressman  Alan Graysons attack on his Republican opponent Dan Webster  media caption Alan Grayson suggests in this video his opponent Dan Websters religious views could be compared to the Taliban A string of headlines about Mr Websters stance on women and audio clips of him talking culminates in the legend Taliban Dan Webster written in vaguely Arabic looking script  It drew fire with critics saying it had taken Mr Websters comments out of context and edited them misleadingly A  poll highlighted in the New York Times  suggests Mr Grayson lost much support in just one week after the release of the ad  This years US primaries saw some fruity adverts with the  Demon Sheep ad  already notorious in the field of attack ads Carly Fiorina attacked her Republican rivals fiscal credentials But who would have thought that such mainstream subject matter could result in an internet video featuring a man dressed as a sheep sporting demon eyes It generated criticism but also much buzz  Having dealt with her Republican rival Ms Fiorina must now deal with incumbent Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer  Her strategy involves both short ads like  her criticism of Ms Boxer  for insisting on being addressed as senator and longer internet ads like the extraordinary Hot Air The Movie which depicts Ms Boxer as a giant hot air balloon of egotism   Ms Boxers own  most recent attack ad  focuses on Ms Fiorinas record as an executive with HewlettPackard outsourcing jobs to China  Its a battle royale in much the same way as the fight between billionaire Meg Whitman and veteran Jerry Brown for the office of governor Ms Whitman has  used the words of Democrat President Bill Clinton  to damn Mr Brown  And Mr Brown  has been able to respond with  an attack on Ms Whitmans record as an Ebay executive   Third party adverts can be even more vicious  In this election there will be more third party advertising Third party adverts tend to be more negative says Prof Ansolabehere  This  advert from the National Republican Senate Committee  is an example attacking Illinois Democrat Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias for having links to organised crime through his brother  The best are short and pithy says Prof Ansolabehere with Connecticut  Republican Senate candidate Linda McMahons attack on her Democrat opponent  being a good example  That is a pretty good character attack straightforward grainy black and white images  A 30 second advert is four or five sentences It is a little tiny narrative about the candidate  Democrat rival Richard Blumenthals own ads again  take advantage of his opponents business background   image caption The Daisy advert is still inspiring imitators nearly five decades later While there are many who believe negative ads can work particularly to focus attention on a particular policy issue its not easy to quantify precisely how well they work  This applies even for those adverts widely perceived to have been successful One such example was the  Willie Horton ad  from 1988 in which it was suggested that Democrat presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had supported a policy which allowed a weekend pass  for a murderer who went on to commit a rape  There is a debate among historians about the Willie Horton ad says Prof Franz Some people say that was a successful attack adâ¦ but it may have worked against President George HW Bush And while efforts are made to research what topics will hurt the opponent its not an exact science  There is some testing of these messages through focus groups I dont think there is prevailing wisdom about the attacks that work says Prof Franz  Fred Davis chief executive of the Republicanoriented media firm Strategic Perception oversaw both the Hot Air and Demon Sheep web films and believes a successful attack ad is now simply one that gets people talking  It doesnt just run and go in one ear and out the other  it jolts them and makes them think You want everybody the next day talking about your ad The rise of YouTube means a successful media strategy is now a mix of 30second television adverts and longer clips aimed at viral web success  But the spirit of the attack remains the same

image copyright Mick LobbGeograph image caption The existing Velindre Cancer Centre is based in Whitchurch  and the new facility would be close to this site Plans for a new cancer hospital in Cardiff are risky for patients two experienced clinicians have said Health Minister Vaughan Gething is expected to announce whether  the new Â£180m Velindre Cancer Centre  in Whitchurch will be backed this week But the clinicians are concerned about the possible number of patient transfers from the centre to a larger hospital and the time that takes Health bosses said safety and care is at the heart of everything we do Velindre NHS Trust has previously said only 30 patients were transferred a year between its current cancer centre and Cardiffs University Hospital of Wales About 10 were designated as red the most serious by the ambulance service But following a Freedom of Information FOI request clinicians found the transfers were closer to 100 in recent years  The plans for the new hospital  have led to protests and a petition signed by more than 7500 people  opposed to it being built on the Northern Meadows site in Whitchurch The dispute over ambulance transfers has raised further concerns about the planned hospital image caption Protesters said they are not against the new hospital but do not want it built on green open land The clinicians have said they are also concerned Velindre might have played down the seriousness of amber calls  There have been more than 70 red or amber calls each year in recent years according to the FOI request The two clinicians  who asked to remain anonymous  discovered that average transfer times for amber calls in 2019 was just under an hour with another 45 minutes to be transferred to the ward after arriving at Cardiffs University Hospital of Wales One of the clinicians said The amber category are very unwell patients who need to have urgent care  Its not the eightminute response for heart attack but they do need help and that help cant be provided at Velindre They said amber calls can include patients having breathing difficulties stroke or major haemorrhage So the amber category are very unwell patients who need to have urgent care added the medic The idea that these are routine calls using the 999 system is disingenuous theyre definitely downplaying the figures The clinicians warned that developments in immunotherapy meant there was a greater risk of patients suffering side effects and claim the new Velindre should be on the site of a larger hospital such as the University Hospital of Wales  image copyright Velindre Cancer Centre  image caption Artists impression of the new Velindre Cancer Centre in Whitchurch They added the Northern Meadows proposal was outdated and the trust should look to build a centre similar to  the new Clatterbridge cancer hospital at Wirral  Im not just expressing a personal opinion  Im speaking for 30 clinicians at Velindre 57 doctors who signed a letter last year and the 163 senior clinicians who recently signed a letter to the health secretary said one of the clinicians  All of whom have expressed concerns that building an isolated unit here on the Northern Meadows without intensive care high dependency and all the other backup you need for sick patients is extremely risky Both clinicians said they have chosen to remain anonymous due to fear of online trolling and harassment In literature provided to the Senedd ahead of the petitions committee last week Velindre said that over the past five years no serious incidents had been reported to Welsh Government due to preventable deaths onsite relating to a delay in transfer to an acute hospital or due to the lack of critical care or anaesthetic support onsite Doctors deep concern over new cancer centre Protest over cancer hospital plan for city meadows It said Velindre Cancer Centre treats some of Wales most vulnerable patients  their safety and care is at the heart of everything we do and we work closely with our staff and colleagues in university health boards to provide the best cancer services possible for the people of southeast Wales The need for a new Velindre Cancer Centre is clear  The current building cannot sustain high quality patient care indefinitely given the age of the building and the increasing number of cancer diagnoses The trust said a recent review found colocating the new cancer centre at the University Hospital of Wales would not be an option for some time and action was required now to improved regional cancer services A Welsh Government spokesperson said We have conducted detailed scrutiny of the outline business cases for the new Velindre Cancer Centre and its enabling works  Welsh ministers are now considering the outcome of this formal process and a decision will be announced in due course Related Topics Vaughan Gething Cancer Whitchurch Welsh government NHS Wales Cardiff More on this story Cancer carer dies with coronavirus Published 12 April

for other people to act first In  a classic experiment  psychologists put people in a room and filled it with smoke to see how they would react People who were on their own were more likely to take action than those who were with other people  Make yourself a smaller target Where theres cover from sight theres cover from fire advises Ian Reed a former British soldier military instructor and chief executive of the Formative Group security firm The first thing is to try to get out of the way and make yourself a smaller target This can involve simply dropping to the ground but ideally means getting behind some sort of cover  Hard cover such as a concrete wall is the best option Obviously Hollywood has portrayed cars as being bulletproof but thats not necessarily the case says Reed Despite this even a car is better than nothing at all  When an attack happens in a tightly packed space a single bullet can end up injuring several people Keeping out of sight reduces the risk that you can be targeted deliberately and also the chances of being hit by someone simply spraying the room with fire  media caption Philonenko Gregoire says his prosthetic leg fooled the gunman who was checking people on the ground for movement Many survivors in Paris  did this instinctively   turning tables over to use as makeshift shelters or hiding behind speakers in the concert hall But the lack of cover on the main floor of the Bataclan meant not everyone there was able to hide  An Irish couple survived by playing dead Another survivor Theresa Cede told the BBC One guy was badly hurt and moaning so we tried to say Shh be quiet stay alive and dont move because every time there was movement somewhere there were more gunshots They are looking for movement  it will catch their eye explains Reed This is especially true if its dark  Some people in the Bataclan  did run for the exit when the attackers paused to reload This can be risky but in some scenarios running away is a good idea  The UK governments advice in its  document on dynamic lockdowns  is to run if there is a safe route out But if there is no safe way to do this it advises hiding The advice is summarised as run hide tell According to eyewitnesses on Friday several people chose to stay hidden in offices and toilets until help arrived  media caption Lassana Bathily I switched off the fridge and told customers to stay calm In January 24yearold  Lassana Bathily was hailed a hero  after hiding Jewish shoppers in a basement cold store during an attack by an Islamist gunman He switched off the fridge and the lights and ran to get help All of those he hid survived  Fighting back Rushing a gunman has worked in some situations In August  a train attack was foiled  in France after passengers overpowered the lone gunman But of the four passengers involved in subduing him one was in the Air Force and another in the National Guard The men only made the attempt after the shooters weapon jammed  image

he adds Its important to remember that many attackers will be working in teams Some will be wearing body armour and others could be carrying explosives  Adel Termos is thought to have saved  dozens of lives in Beirut last week after he tackled a bomber from behind But the suicide vest exploded and both Termos and the bomber died in the blast  Despite the dangers some people argue that its important to be ready to fight if necessary Members of the Islamic State group are not motivated by taking hostages says James Alvarez psychologist and hostage negotiator Theres nobody to negotiate with Your

from a window After the escape Once someone has managed to escape the situation its important for them to remain vigilant Get as far away as possible behind as much hard cover as possible and go to the nearest authority figures for help says Reed It can be dangerous to join big groups nearby and to take public transport Always assume that theres going to be a secondary device or action adds Reed The key is to take advice from police officers or other officials as they may have better knowledge of the situation  Help each other image copyright Getty Images The chances of being caught up in a major attack  are still low  But if it does happen cooperating with others can increase peoples chance of survival says Chris Cocking social psychologist and expert in crowd behaviour   After the 77 London attacks Cocking helped interview dozens of people involved and concluded that the quickest and most efficient way for a group to evacuate is for people to work together This is the only way to avoid situations such as a crowd getting jammed at a fire escape Cocking says that  most people are likely to try to help each other  even in extreme situations Theres an assumption that its everybody

I punched the shark in the back How do you stop a great white shark a creature that can grow up to six metres in length and weigh more than a tonne It is a question that has dogged authorities in those countries where people suffer attacks by sharks great white and others Attacks continue to happen and as long as they do so will the calls for preventative measures In the latest case Laeticia Brouwer 17 was  fatally attacked  by a shark on Monday while surfing off Western Australia In response Australias Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg has said he would consider new proposals including culling adding that the government would welcome any proposal to put human life first On Thursday the Senate environmental committee will hold a hearing  already planned before Laeticia Brouwers death  on shark mitigation strategies But what are the possible solutions Do they make sense And are shark attacks a big enough problem to warrant such measures image copyright Shark Shield The possible solutions 1 Shark shields A shark shield is a device that lets out an electromagnetic pulse to deter sharks and the Western Australia WA government has proposed offering a subsidy of A200 Â£117 150 to anyone wanting to buy one this is roughly equivalent to a third of the cost of the device On the other hand the WA opposition says shields would remain prohibitively expensive to most people even with a discount The University of Western Australias Oceans Institute has been tasked with testing different shark deterrents by Australias federal government  Speaking to media on Wednesday Prof Shaun Collin the institutes director said a shark shield proved to be an effective deterrent in 400 tests of an investigative shark attack  in which the shark approaches prey to assess what it is However he said the shields proved ineffective in ambush attacks in which the shark swims at speed from deep on seeing a silhouette  possibly of a surfer Can science stop sharks attacking humans 2 Shark nets media caption The shark net debate A shark net is stretched through the water to try and separate swimmers and surfers from what may try and approach them They are not new at all having been used across Australia for decades The New South Wales government ran a trial with a net from 201516 and in one aspect it proved successful  it caught 133 sharks in that time The down side A government report showed 615 other marine animals were caught including 90 threatened or protected species Close to half of them died after being caught in the netting The nets have been called cruel by campaigners and have been cut by activists Why the jump in NSW shark attacks 3 Drum lines and culling image copyright Getty Images This method too has been attacked as cruel  it is a baited hook suspended underwater and tied to a float on the surface of the water It is also anchored to the sea bed meaning the shark has nowhere to go once it has taken the bait Larger sharks are often shot smaller ones released It was a policy pushed in Western Australia under the states previous government and has been used in other Australian states There was some controversy that drum lines were not put in place on the beach where Laeticia Brouwer died But many also question their effectiveness  including the government now in place in WA On Tuesday the states Fisheries Minister Dave Kelly  told ABC  We made it clear in opposition that we dont see the merit in automatically deploying drum lines because they dont actually make our beaches any safer We want to focus on individual shark deterrence which can actually provide genuine protection for the people who are most at risk The possibility of an active cull  not just killing sharks caught in drum lines  was one raised by Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday And while Australias government is committed to  a programme  of conserving shark populations and proposals of culls are generally met with protests there is some support for a targeted cull An editorial  in the centreright The Australian newspaper  by its surf writer written after Laeticia Brouwers death said our insane shark conservation policies have cost another life adding that there was blood on the hands of the government Shark cull divides a nation There are plenty of solutions on the table  but just how big a problem are shark attacks in Australia When Laeticia Brouwer was attacked near Esperance on Monday she became the 15th person to be killed by a shark in Western Australia since 2000 but the first in the country since June last year The number of shark attacks in Australia  including fatal and nonfatal  has risen over the past century but in a way that is consistent with how Australias population has grown  But as horrific as those incidents are for everyone affected there is on average only one death due to a shark attack in Australia every year The number of people killed by a shark in Australian waters has changed little over the years despite the countrys population  and tourist numbers  booming In 1950 when there were  83m  people living in Australia two people were killed by sharks Last year with a population of more than  24m  there were still only two fatalities John G West who runs the Australian Shark Attack File which reports all attacks for the Taronga Conservation Society says the chances of being killed by a shark now are much slimmer than in previous years In  a 2011 report  he said the number of attacks that were fatal fell from  45  in the 1930s to  10  in the decade leading up to 2011 But while human populations have grown he points out that the number of sharks has fallen One thing though seems sure Encounters with sharks although a rare event will continue to occur if humans continue to enter the ocean professionally or for recreational pursuit Mr West writes Related Topics Australia Sharks More on this story A shark cull divides a nation Published 10 April 2014 Death

attack is unlike any they have seen before Supermarket giant Tesco has suspended some parts of its online banking system after it detected attempts to steal cash from customers accounts  It said it spotted suspicious transactions on 40000 accounts over the weekend with  money reportedly taken from about half of them Tesco has declined to elaborate on what happened or say how much cash went astray but said it was working with the National Crime Agency to investigate and find the culprits Is this the first of its kind Yes because this seems to be the first time that a UK bank has reacted so publicly by stopping some types of transactions on a web banking system because of online criminal activity  Banks are targeted all the time but typically those attacks just hit a few individuals so do not bring about a site closure In this case as far as we can tell a lot of people lost cash very quickly Security expert Troy Hunt said the incident was unprecedented in its scale He added that the shutdown was embarrassing for Tesco and indicated how serious it was image copyright maciek905 image caption Updates to websites can introduce bugs and vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit Was it hacked Tesco did not use the H word in its statement and in interviews its chief executive and other people speaking on behalf of the company have been careful in their choice of language It has said that the attack was sophisticated and that an initial investigation had revealed exactly what had happened So far it has not shared that information but Tescos actions in the wake of the weekends events do help to narrow down the possibilities By letting customers withdraw cash from ATMs use cards in shops and pay bills it suggests that whatever went wrong does not involve the core computer systems underpinning Tesco bank These systems used to be run by RBS but since 2008 Tesco has operated independently Security expert James Maude from software company Avecto said Tescos decision to suspend online transactions combined with the information that so many people were hit at once clearly suggests problems with its website All too often he said maintenance or website updates can introduce errors and bugs that were not present before Cyberthieves are constantly scanning valuable websites to spot changes and will swoop if one emerges It might also be the case that a third party connected to Tesco had a security issue and attackers got in via that route which has happened in some of the biggest attacks in recent memory image copyright Thinkstock image caption To improve protection on bank accounts use a unique hard to guess password Can it stop this happening again Most cybersecurity experts have a very jaundiced view of the world that they often sum up by saying Everything is broken and there is always a way in In short there is no way that any organisation can keep it and its customers and their data safe all the time Many organisations now assume they will be breached and set up monitoring systems to spot when that happens while also training staff to react quickly to fix problems Nik Whitfield from security firm Panaseer said often firms were caught out by vulnerabilities that emerge in software they use rather than through a change they make It can be hard for organisations to keep across these factors because they use so many software packages  In addition some of the bugs are found by malicious hackers who sell them to gangs that want to use them In these cases the first an organisation will know about a bug is when it is used against them  Tesco has had problems with some other webbased systems in the past In 2014 thousands of Tesco customers net accounts were deactivated after login names and passwords were shared online In that case  Tesco said attackers had compiled the data by using details stolen from other sites because some Tesco customers reused passwords How did it notice the suspicious activity Like many other banks Tesco has automatic fraudspotting systems that keep an eye on accounts and build up a picture of normal activity It is these kind of systems that can catch you out if you suddenly use your credit or debit card to buy lots of things from lots of different places in just a few minutes  It is these monitoring systems that are believed to have alerted Tesco to the problems that led to it suspending the site and halting transactions image copyright Getty Images image caption Most bank sites offer twofactor authentication which is worth using to improve security Can I protect myself against these kinds of attacks We still do not know the details of what happened so it is difficult to give concrete advice However it is worth taking a few simple steps to protect your online account  First choose a good password and do not reuse one that you use elsewhere Use the banks twofactor authentication and keep an eye on the transactions carried out via your account Keep security software on your PC phone or tablet uptodate and be on the lookout for phishing emails that capitalise on news about any breach  James Chappell chief technology officer at computer security service Digital

page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption Experts in the hidden web are now seeking clues about how the 27 sites were seized The hidden web community has started trying to find out how services and identities were compromised after police raids led to 17 arrests Last week several highprofile sites on the socalled hidden dark or deep web were seized Experts are looking at techniques the authorities may have used to decloak people running services accessed through anonymisation service Tor We were as surprised as most of you said the group that develops Tor In a blog post  the Tor Project team wrote We are left asking How did they locate the hidden services We dont know  In liberal democracies we should expect that when the time comes to prosecute some of the 17 people who have been arrested the police would have to explain to the judge how the suspects came to be suspects As a side benefit of the operation of justice Tor could learn if there are security flaws in hidden services or other critical internetfacing services image copyright Other image caption Sites seized showed the following caption The anonymity Tor offers means that it has become popular with criminals as a way to conduct their activities online But the Tor Project which receives funding from the US government is also seen as a key component for those who need anonymity on the internet for other important reasons such as activism in repressive regimes Operation Onymous Tor is one of several services that allows people to access what is generally referred to as the hidden deep or dark web Here sites that do not show up on traditional search engines are located  But more importantly users on Tor have their locations and therefore identities hidden This is achieved by routing a persons journey on the internet through various different computers in locations all over the world creating anonymity However with this latest raid the anonymity of users on Tor is again under question But one expert Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London told the BBC it was unlikely that Tor itself had been cracked Some major hidden markets are still available he noted Including some of the biggest  image copyright Other image caption The apparent owner of the nowclosed Doxbin posted the sites logs for other experts to pore over If they had a successful way of compromising hidden services they would have done it to everyone The shutdown of the hidden web services was coordinated by Europol in what it dubbed Operation Onymous  In a press release it said more than 400 services were shut  although it later clarified that to mean 400 pages were disabled Those pages had belonged to 27 individual services that were seized and closed The majority of the sites were selling drugs or other illegal paraphernalia while others dealt with the selling of stolen credit card data The most highprofile closure was of Silk Road 20  a site selling drugs set up after the closure of the original Silk Road site last year  The Tor Project went into detail listing possible methods of how the sites were compromised and their owners arrested They included Poor operational security   that is basic failings in running the websites On Silk Road 20 investigators noted that an email address identifying Blake Benthall whos been accused of running the site was found within its code Bugs in web applications   just as in the open internet elements used within pages such as video players or other interactive features on Tor can be vulnerable to bugs and exploits The Tor Project said some of the sites seized were likely to have contained quicklycoded eshops which as a result had weaknesses Bitcoin deanonymisation   Those using illegal services need a way to pay for what they are getting  and Bitcoin is often the virtual currency of choice While Bitcoin is far harder to trace than the use of normal payment methods it is certainly not completely anonymous  Recent research has demonstrated  ways to link Bitcoin transactions with a users location Denial of Service DoS attack   Highly theoretical at this stage law enforcement could orchestrate a DoS attack  where a site is flooded with visits  in an attempt to force traffic to access Tor through computers owned and monitored by the authorities Concerns about this complex technique  were raised earlier this year Hello internet supervillain here In an attempt to find clues as to the authorities tactics one owner of a seized site  who was apparently not arrested  released log files showing activity on his onion the term given to sites on Tor He offered the logs up to the community for scrutiny On a mailing list for Tor developers he wrote This will probably be a very humbling experience because unlike my fellow illegal onion operators both past and present I will actually be outside of a jail cell and able to read the ruthless dissection of my setup  media caption Troels Oerting from Europol explained to the BBCs Anna Holligan how the joint police operation unfolded On the bright side youre all are getting way more info from me than the pigs police will ever willingly cough up which means if they have some sort of magic onion decloak trick this mailing list discussion is a good chance at finding it His post titled yes hello internet supervillain here shared details of Doxbin a hidden website that allowed people to upload documents supposedly anonymously From the logs some have suggested that the DoS attack as detailed above was responsible for deanonymising users of the site Dr Murdoch noted that getting a real explanation for how Operation Onymous was carried out is unlikely Theyre not going to tell anyone about it because they want to do it again he said They want people to be afraid to run illegal hidden services Follow Dave Lee  on Twitter DaveLeeBBC Explainer What is Tor Tor is a special way to access the internet that requires software known as the Tor Browser bundle to use it The name is an acronym for The Onion Router  just as there are many layers to the vegetable there are many layers of encryption on the network It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory and continues to receive funding from the US State Department It attempts to hide a persons location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several nodes  which in this context means using volunteers PCs and computer servers as connection points Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity To the website that ultimately receives the request it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain  known as an exit relay  rather than the person responsible As well as allowing users to visit normal websites anonymously it can also be used as part of a process to host hidden sites which use the onion suffix Tors users include the military law enforcement officers and journalists  who use it as a way of communicating with whistleblowers  as well as members of the public who wish to keep their browser activity secret But it has also been associated with illegal activity allowing people to visit sites offering illegal drugs for sale and access to child abuse images which do not show up in normal search engine results and would not be available to those who did not know where to look Related Topics Cybersecurity Internet National Security Agency More on this story Huge raid shuts 400 dark net sites Published 7 November

Images image caption GCHQ is reported to have disrupted at least one chatroom service used by Anonymous GCHQ disrupted hacktivist communications by using one of their own techniques against them according to the latest Edward Snowden leaks Documents from the whistleblower  published by NBC  indicate UK cyberspies used a denial of service attack DoS in 2011 to force a chatroom used by the Anonymous collective offline A spokeswoman for GCHQ said all the agencys activities were authorised and subject to rigorous oversight But others say it raises concerns Dr Steven Murdoch a security researcher at the University of Cambridge said using a DoS attack to overwhelm a computer server with traffic would have risked disrupting other services Its quite possible that the server was used for other purposes which would have been entirely unrelated to Anonymous he said Its also likely that most of the chat that was going on about Anonymous was not to do with hacking because the people who join Anonymous are fairly wideranging in what they think it is legitimate to do Some have gone into criminality but many others just go out and organise protests letterwriting campaigns and other things that are not criminal Campaign group Privacy International is also worried There is no legislation that clearly authorises GCHQ to conduct cyberattacks said head of research Eric King So in the absence of any democratic mechanisms it appears GCHQ has granted itself the power to carry out the very same offensive attacks politicians have criticised other states for conducting The UK governments Cyber Security Strategy document  published in 2011  says officials should take proactive measures to disrupt threats to our information security but also notes that any such action should be consistent with freedom of expression and privacy rights Hacker arrests The latest documents are published  alongside an article  partwritten by Glenn Greenwald  The journalist is one of only two people reported to have access to all whistleblower Edward Snowdens leaked documents image copyright Getty Images image caption GCHQ has not discussed the specifics of the operations included in the Snowden leaks The article highlights that the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group JTRIG is the division identified as being responsible for the DoS attack   a unit whose existence had not previously been publicly disclosed The documents indicate the unit also spied on and communicated with chatroom users to identify hackers who had stolen information In one case agents are said to have tricked a hacker nicknamed P0ke who claimed to have stolen data from the US government They did this by sending him a link to a BBC article entitled Who loves the hacktivists Sexy P0ke is alleged to have commented  But when he clicked the link it is reported that JTRIG was able to bypass measures he had taken to hide his identity although it is not clear how image caption GCHQ is said to have tricked one hacktivist by sending him a link to a BBC article NBC reports that P0ke  a Scandinavian college student  was never arrested despite GCHQ learning his true name But the leaks indicate others were imprisoned as a result of JTRIG operations  One paper highlights the case of Edward Pearson  a hacker known as GZero  who was sentenced to two years in jail in 2012 for illegally acquiring credit and debit card details registered with PayPal A transcript of a chatroom conversation indicates that Pearson had contacted GCHQ agents claiming he knew a hacktivist they were investigating unaware of the agents true identity Grey area In addition to Anonymous the documents list LulzSec the ATeam and the Syrian Cyber Army as hacktivist groups GCHQ was concerned about In one case it appears simply warning activists that carrying out their own DoS attacks was illegal had the desired effect NBC reports that the notice was posted via Facebook Twitter email instant messenger and Skype  One alleged GCHQ document states that one month later 80 of those contacted had stopped using a hacktivist chatroom image copyright Lulzsec image caption Several of the Lulzsec hackers have been arrested after carrying out DoS attacks But the documents also indicate that GCHQ was willing to use DoS attacks itself as part of an operation codenamed Rolling Thunder which prevented hacktivists using a chatroom for 30 hours in September 2011 GCHQ has a longstanding policy of not commenting on specific intelligencegathering procedures but a spokeswoman said all its work was carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework Even so one cybersecurity expert said he had mixed feelings about the latest leaks We have to remember that cyberspooks within GCHQ are equally if not more skilled than many blackhat hackers and the tools and techniques they are going to use to fight cybercrime are surely going to be similar to that of the bad guys said Andrew Miller chief operating officer at Corero Network Legally we enter a very grey area here where members of Lulzsec were arrested and incarcerated for carrying out DoS attacks but it seems that JTRIG are taking the same approach with impunity More on this story Spy chief Snowden hurt US security Published 29 January 2014 NSAGCHQ cyberspy leaks A glossary Published 28 January 2014 Tech firms detail

comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Republicans have had some sharp words about Obamas economic policies  but do they add up Waterville Valley New Hampshire Skiers in bright clothes snake down the mountain side in the brilliant sunshine  of the White Mountains   But puffs of fine fog further up the slope are a telltale sign of an unseasonable annoyance No snow  The mist from half a dozen blowers is manmade snow The skiing is fine but the resort as a whole feels less wintry than it should That is a worry to some in a state where tourism long ago replaced manufacturing as the main source of income  Noone blames President Obama for the weather The White House isnt accused of stopping snow with too many regulations That is almost a surprise  But the Republican candidates vying to become their partys candidate for president do blame him for most of the countrys economic woes and do so in strong language  They suggest  hes killed jobs  and is taking the US on an unAmerican road Frontrunner Mitt Romney says in every speech that Obama is turning an enterprise culture into a Europeanstyle entitlement society  Given that the latest figures  suggest the economy  is picking up I wonder how this plays now Particularly in New Hampshire a state that is richer has less poverty and lower unemployment  than most in the USA  The Waterville Valley ski resorts boss is Chris Sununu the son of John  former White House chief of staff and New Hampshire governor  Chris Sununu says both as a businessman and a Republican he does blame Obama for the state of the economy When you have a strategy of big bloated government a lot of regulation and the sense that government can do better than the individual can thats just not what America was built on and thats not what drives a good free economy he says I put it to him that is fine as political rhetoric but question whether Obamas policies have really hurt his thriving ski resort Without a doubt Sununu said In the season I have close to 500 to 800 employees at any given time The healthcare costs alone can be enormous on that But if I dont know what the regulations are gonna be if I think government is going to be too overbearing on me then I have to hold my cash I have to hold back I cant expand I cant be creative I cant give my employees the benefits that they might need because I dont know whats coming down the road Its that uncertainty that so many businesses in America are facing today that we just gotta get out from underneath Not everyone agrees that the language of the campaign reflects reality At the house party for Republican candidate Jon Huntsman  which  I mentioned yesterday  I ran into Donald Byrne  Mr Byrne is the boss of a software company and an independent whos reregistered as a Republican so he can vote for the former ambassador to China and Utah governor  He says the language used about Obama is pandering to the base I think the Republican party in the United States has shifted very far to the right he says  Being a moderate is a negative in this campaign and thats very unfortunate because the majority of Americans are moderate and well balanced in their thought process There is too much pandering to these rightwing extreme sides It is the nature of elections that choices are put in stark easytounderstand terms I have no doubt that in 2012 two very different visions of America will be on offer  But does a polarised politics force cruder choices than might be good for a countrys economic health  I meet Bob Bastani a senior New Hampshire Republican and economist in his home overlooking New Hampshires beautiful coastal basin near Newmarket   He worked in the treasury team under the first President Bush most recently headed a bank in the Philippines and ran unsuccessfully for Congress  He told me that while politics still was a battle between the  economics of Milton Friedman  and  John Maynard Keynes   in reality neither theory can cope with the current crisis That battle between those two views has been the central debate in economics for almost 100 years now but they have converged somewhere in the middle Mr Bastani said  If you look at Keynesian economics they have moved much more towards an acceptance of monetary policy  Thats part of the problem the two have sort of met in the middle and are stuck there with no real policy prescriptions So there is no real blackandwhite answer much as we would like to have blackandwhite answers So if you have the two principal instruments of economic management no longer working then what do you do And thats the central conundrum Still campaigning in primary colours works well even if you have to govern in grey Republican voters choosing a candidate on Tuesday may be looking for the man best able to excoriate Obama rather than the one most suited to replace him By the time the polls close he may even have been blamed for the lack of snow  View comments

Reality Check image copyright Getty Images Following the London terror attack which left seven people dead and 48 injured Theresa May has said the UK must adapt to a new trend in terrorism There were 255 terrorismrelated arrests in the year ending 31 March 2016  according to the latest statistics from the Home Office The arrests led to 37 prosecutions In 2015 128 terrorist and extremist prisoners were released from custody the Home Office says Reality Check has been looking into the main powers the police and security services have to stop suspected terrorists Stop and search Under Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 the police can stop and search a suspect if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities Its difficult to know how many stop and searches are carried out under this power as most police forces dont separate Section 43 from other types of stop and search  One force that does hold the data is the Met police They say that 541 people were searched under the Terrorism Act in the 12 months to March 2016  a rise of 32 on the previous year  The police also have the power to search suspects even if they dont have suspicion of any links to terrorist activities  In May 2012 the rules were tightened the police can only carry out searches in designated places where they have reasonable grounds to believe an act of terrorism will take place  14 day detention At present anyone arrested under the Terrorism Act can be held without charge for up to 14 days In 2006 the law was changed in order to double the maximum period to 28 days Only six suspects were ever held for that length  In 2011 it reverted back to 14 days  This was during the coalition government when it was decided not to proceed with the annual vote in Parliament to keep it at 28 days Theresa May was home secretary at the time In the year to March 2016 46 people were detained under the powers  25 of whom were charged The longest anyone was held for was 13 days which happened on three occasions during that year Power to arrest suspects planning an attack The police can arrest individuals who they suspect of planning an attack Section 5 of the 2006 Terrorism Act made it a specific offence to prepare or help others prepare for an act of terrorism The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for life According to the CPS 25 people were convicted under Section 5 in the year ending September 2016 up from 11 in the previous 12 months There is no specific offence for carrying out a terrorist act If a perpetrator was arrested after committing an attack they would be charged with offences such as murder or grievous bodily harm It is also an offence for someone not to tell the police about someone they believe is involved in planning a terrorism act A conviction for this offence can lead to a five year maximum sentence  Banned organisations Organisations can be banned by the home secretary if they are believed to be participating promoting or encouraging terrorism  Being a member  or claiming to be a member  of a banned organisation can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and or a fine The  Home Office says  71 international terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000  Surveillance A small number of agencies are able to carry out surveillance inside residential premises or private vehicles The power requires authorisation by the secretary of state The Office of Surveillance Commissioners provides independent oversight The security services also have the power to intercept communication data The power is available to nine agencies including GCHQ and MI5  The Investigatory Powers Act passed in 2016 compels internet companies to keep records of every website and messaging service UKbased citizens visit for a year TPims Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures or TPims are a form of house arrest It applies to people who are deemed a threat but cannot be prosecuted or deported if they are a foreign national They were first introduced in 2012 and replaced controversial control orders Those under TPims can be subjected to electronic tagging having to report regularly to the police and surrendering travel documents A suspect must live at home and stay there overnight  possibly for up to 10 hours image copyright Science Photo Library image caption Electronic tags are used to monitor the movements of criminals The suspect is allowed to use a mobile phone and the internet to work and study subject to conditions In 2015 TPims were toughened by granting the ability to relocate subjects up to 200 miles away from their normal residence TPims initially last for one year although they can be extended to two It is possible for them to remain beyond the twoyear maximum if there is suspicion of further terrorism activity A breach of the TPims can lead to imprisonment As of November 2016 seven people were subjected to TPims  six of whom were British citizens Temporary Exclusion Orders Temporary Exclusion Orders TEOs were created by the 2015 CounterTerrorism and Security Act They apply to British citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad They are designed to stop suspects from reentering the UK unless they give themselves up at the border Those subjected to TEOs are only allowed to return if they make contact with the UK authorities If they do come back they are likely to face either prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers The Orders last for up to two years at a time and can be renewed Breaches could lead to a prison sentence The home secretary applies the TEO where they reasonably suspect that the subject is or has been involved in terrorismrelated activity while outside the UK The government released details on its disruptive and investigatory powers in February In the wake of the Manchester bombing the Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed they had been used once so far Port and border controls Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police the power to stop search and hold individuals at ports airports and international railway stations Initially individuals could be questioned for up to nine hours  although a change in the guidelines means it is now up to six hours The police also have the power to inspect electronic devices such as phones and laptops The police do not need prior knowledge or suspicion to use Schedule 7  although the Home Office says its done after informed considerations A total of 23717 people were stopped under the power in the year ending June 2016 a fall of 23 on the previous year Despite fewer people being stopped the number detained under the power has increased by 7 rising from 1649 to 1760 in the same period Read more from Reality Check

link About sharing image caption Whales undoubtedly have complex brains but are they capable of acts of revenge The revenge of a whale or an accidental tragedy A dramatic retelling of the story that inspired Herman Melvilles classic novel will be hitting our screens on BBC One this Sunday  but do whales really attack humans intentionally Sperm whales are relatively placid mammals and very few incidents in modern times suggest otherwise They mainly feed on squid and rarely attack apparently only when mistaking other mammals for seals or prey  In his 1839 book about the natural history of sperm whales Thomas Beale a surgeon aboard a whaleship described them as a most timid and inoffensive animal readily endeavouring to escape from the slightest thing which bears an unusual appearance But Dr Richard Bevan a zoologist and lecturer at Newcastle University suggests that a sperm whale may remember if it was previously attacked I have no doubt that an individual would remember being harpooned and might respond aggressively if it thought that it was threatened he said image caption Gregory Peck front second from right portrayed Ahab in the 1956 film version of Moby Dick On the other hand a large vessel like a whaling boat would probably look like a very large threat even to a full grown sperm whale so Id have thought it more likely to have moved away But 19th century literature seems to suggest otherwise with numerous stories of sperm whales attacking ships on purpose But were they fuelled by threat hunger or as in Melvilles classic novel even revenge In 1820 a giant sperm whale apparently 85 feet long the average is 50ft attacked a whaleship named the Essex causing her to sink Her crew were left adrift in three whaleboats lighter boats used in the capture of whales thousands of miles from land  Alone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the men had to decide whether to head for the nearest islands a thousand miles downwind to the west or set out on an epic journey of almost three thousand miles to reach the South American mainland  Fear of cannibals forced them to choose South America but they never made it Of the 21 crew members aboard The Essex just eight members of the crew were rescued after more than 80 days at sea with an incredible tale of starvation dehydration and unfathomable mortal desperation to tell  image caption Whaling was a lucrative business in the 19th Century driven by commodities such as whale oil Two members of the crew wrote accounts of the failed voyage First mate Owen Chases account was a widely circulated story of the time published just months after his return home The other written by cabin boy Thomas Nickerson 50 years later was not published but remarkably was discovered in an attic in 1960 80 years after Nickersons death Their accounts differ in places but what is indisputable is that they both recall exactly how their supposedly lucky ship sank It was stove by a giant whale Herman Melville heard this story met with the captain of the Essex and was inspired to write his classic novel Moby Dick Moby Dick was actually named after a real whale Mocha Dick first spotted by sailors in the 19th century near the island of Mocha near southern Chile Whales were often given pet names by sailors Tom and Dick were common  though there are no accounts of a Harry Mocha Dick was an albino whale described by explorer Jerimiah N Reynolds as an old bull whale of prodigious size and strengthâ¦ white as wool Legend has it that it killed 30 men and was covered in scars and punctured with spears from previous attempts to harpoon it before eventually being slaughtered in 1838 Sometimes described as Leviathans sperm whales truly are creatures of mythical proportions They have the largest teeth of any whale and live to be more than 60 years old They can dive deeper than any other sea mammal around 3km in order to catch their favourite deep sea food the elusive squid But it is the fact that they have the largest brains on Earth ones that are more complex  in certain ways  than those of humans that is perhaps most surprising Their cerebral cortex is much more convoluted than the human cortex and they are social creatures with strong bonds staying in stable social groupings and keeping constant companions throughout their lifespan  Dr Lindy Weilgart a research associate in the department of biology at Dalhousie University in Canada believes that in order to remember all their complex social relationships families more distantly related kin nonrelated group members they require a good memory In fact remembering traumatic past incidents could well have been the trigger for the whale that rammed the Essex Briefly I do believe a sperm whale is capable of the aggression necessary to attack a ship especially a mother if her young was threatened Dr Weilgart says I know whalers in general often harpooned calves but kept them alive so as to attract the rest of the family group which came in aid of the calf They then harpooned those adults she says a practice that was particularly cruel However Dr Bevan suggests that while the cetaceans do have large brainsâ¦ this is linked to their ability to process sound rather than being linked to what we regard as intelligence Whether they can feel emotions like vengeance is in dispute It is possible that the whale changed course underwater at the last minute and unwittingly collided with the ship  image caption The Whale on BBC One tells the story of the illfated voyage of The Essex Dr Per Berggren a lecturer in marine science at Newcastle University and specialist in marine mammals believes this to be nearer the truth  It is perhaps more likely that the ship accidentally hit the whale and sustained a leak large enough to sink the vessel But what is remarkable in the case of the Essex sinking is that the whale came back to strike a second time  First Mate Chase recalled I turned around and saw himâ¦ directly ahead of us coming down with twice his ordinary speedâ¦ with tenfold fury and vengeance in his aspect  The surf flew in all directions about him with the continual violent thrashing of his tail His head about half out of the water and in that way he came upon us and again struck the ship The ship brought up as suddenly and violently as if she had struck a rock and trembled for a few minutes like a leaf  Latest research shows that whales are selfaware sentient and more intelligent than previously thought They can feel pain and suffering and therefore potentially a level of cognitive function it is also now thought they can even experience feelings of love image caption Tilikum a captive orca was involved in the death of a trainer in 2010 Sperm whales do not have many predators killer whales orcas are known to have attacked sperm whales and occasionally sharks but since the early 1700s by a large the most serious predator of sperm whales has been homo sapiens  Whaling in the 19th century was a lucrative business as whale oil became immensely valuable for lighting oil lamps and making candles and soaps More than 900 whaleships were out to sea in the mid1800s hailing mainly from American ports with an average voyage length of three or four years  By the mid 19th century whale numbers were depleting rapidly But with the discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania in 1859 the American whaling industry had almost completely disappeared by the start of World War I  Whale hunting is now illegal in most parts of the world though still practised by some nations such as Norway and Japan and concerns about the welfare of whales in captivity are currently making waves in the news  The documentary film Blackfish about an orca in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando that was involved in several deaths has recently caused controversy for the theme park The documentary suggests that keeping the whales in captivity may be causing them to behave psychotically Acts including Willie Nelson and Barenaked Ladies have recently cancelled performances at the park in the wake of the films release But SeaWorld has issued a detailed rebuttal of claims in the film When First Mate Starbuck declares to Captain Ahab that Moby Dick seeks thee not It is thou thou that madly seekest him its likely he was telling an awful and haunting truth  Whether or not the sperm whale that attacked the whaleship Essex on the night of 20 November 1820 did so on purpose we will never know But the fascinating and undying rumour of his revenge certainly lives on The Whale will be shown on BBC One on

2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics New York truck attack media caption Trump on New York terror suspect Send him to Gitmo As presidential candidate Donald Trump made being tough on what he called radical Islamic terror a central plank of his election bid How has he responded to the first test of this nature since taking office In the immediate aftermath of the attack in New York on Tuesday evening Donald Trump offered a measured reaction His White House released a statement offering thoughts and prayers praising first responders and pledging federal support for the ongoing investigation  The president tweeted that that the perpetrator was a very sick and deranged person  the same words he used to describe the man who  killed more than 50 people  in Las Vegas a month ago  There were hints of what was to come however He tweeted about not allowing ISIS to return or enter our country and another about stepping up his extreme vetting border security programme Then on Wednesday morning the dam broke These are some interesting points about what followed Partisan swipes The president lashed out against Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer  who represents the state where the attack took place  for supporting an immigration lottery system that gives residency to 50000 applicants from nations that do not send many of their citizens to the US He called on Congress to end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program calling it a Chuck Schumer beauty although the system was set up in 1990 law that was passed with broad bipartisan support and signed by Republican President George HW Bush  As Republican Senator Jeff Flake pointed out on Twitter Mr Schumer was among a bipartisan group who recently tried to change the programme as part of comprehensive immigration reform Mr Trump also tweeted that Mr Schumer was trying to import Europes sic problems which prompted a dry response from the senator media caption New York truck attack Who is Sayfullo Saipov I guess its not too soon to politicise a tragedy  he tweeted  Trump supporters have been quick to throw the hypocrisy flag on their ideological counterparts as well  Still waiting for liberal

Schumer has countered with his own policy recommendations  urging the president to back away from proposed budget cuts to antiterrorism programmes Our city relies on it to snuff out attacks  he tweeted  It took less than 24 for hours for this latest incident to become drenched in politics A change of course In the aftermath of the devastating hurricanes that hit the US earlier this year and the Las Vegas attack in September the White House had cautioned that heated debates about politics and policy should be delayed To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm versus helping people or actually facing the effect of the storm is misplaced Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt  said  in response to a question about climate change was Hurricane Irma headed toward the Florida coast There will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place but thats not the place that were in at this moment Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the day after the Nevada mass shooting the largest in modern US history When asked why Mr Trump had suggested that his proposed travel ban was necessary shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016 Sanders replied that theres a difference between being a candidate and being the president  When it came to the New York attack however President Trump followed the Orlando route Different attacks a different response The presidents comments on Wednesday  stands in marked contrast to his reaction to other domestic terror attacks that have occurred during his presidency  After a white nationalist in Charlottesville drove a car into a crowd of counterprotesters killing one Mr Trump explained that he delayed commenting because unlike other politicians he wanted to make sure he knew all the facts before assigning blame I dont want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement he said media caption What Trump said versus what I saw  by the BBCs Joel Gunter But the presidents critics have pointed out his reticence when attacks involve perpetrators who are not Muslims He has not spoken at all about a man who  was arrested  on 6 October for trying to plant a nail bomb at an airport in Asheville North Carolina The suspect told police he wanted to fight a war on US soil Mr Trump also  held his tongue when another man  was arrested  on terrorism charges on 19 October for detonating a bomb in a parking lot in Williamsburg Virginia  For the president it seems the New York attack  like the Orlando mass shooting  merited a different response The Fox factor So what changed between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning  Mr Trump always seems to be at his most rambunctious on Twitter in the morning  in part because he likes to spend the time watching his favourite news programme Fox  Friends On Wednesday the show featured guests  including former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka and retired Lt Colonel Tony Shaffer  who repeatedly laid the blame for the New York attacks on US immigration policies they said were backed by Mr Schumer and Democrats  image copyright Getty Images image caption Donald Trump has called Fox  Friends one of his favourite news programmes The president followed the shows lead In two of his tweets he included the Fox  Friends Twitter handle  It has become a recurring occurrence during the Trump presidency The Fox News morning show runs a segment on a controversial topic and the president quickly fires off tweets on a similar theme Whether the subject is flagburning NFL protests Confederate monuments healthcare immigration Fox  Friends has become a window into the presidents mind and a preview of tweets to come Wednesday morning was only the latest example Related Topics New York truck attack Donald Trump

link About sharing media caption Tracey Hanson whose son was stabbed to death says the treatment of victims has been âinhumaneâ When Tracey Hansons son Josh was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack in 2015 it was the start of a tough journey through the criminal justice system She said she was passed from pillar to post throughout and the impact stays with her today Experiences like hers  and others who have been victims of crime  is driving a fresh call from Labour for a Victims Law to strengthen their rights  Labours shadow victims minister Peter Kyle said for too long those who suffer have been forgotten and squeezed out by the system  A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said a new version of the Victims Code coming into force in April will boost the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process and legislation will follow later this year  Crimes unreported as public lose faith in police Older victims of crime not cared for well enough says report Londons forgotten victims of violent crime Josh was 21 when he was stabbed in a bar in London which led to what his mum described as a retraumatising experience with the criminal justice system where you suffer unnecessarily over and over again She said Youre turning to the very resources that youve always believed as a citizen are there for you to help you at your time of need  When youre desperately in need of that help and support and its not forthcoming Honestly its just absolutely horrific I cant tell you the number of experiences Ive had but some are just inhumane image copyright Metropolitan Police image caption Josh Hanson was stabbed in London in 2015 One incident that has stayed with Tracey happened just days after her sons death when she went to see him in the mortuary At this traumatising time she was asked to sign forms deciding what to do with cells and tissue from his body I was asked to sign that on the day that I was seeing my son in a mortuary for the first time seeing my sons body laid out she said  Imagine that I mean I would have signed my house away I would have signed anything  I had no recollection of that experience until threeandahalf years later when I started to think about getting Joshs clothes Tracey said she was then told by email that she had signed the forms and his tissue had been destroyed She had also not been given her own copy of the document The mortuary keeps a copy the coroner the police keep a copy but you as a victim who has signed an extremely important document youre not even given a copy because there isnt one for you she said  Wheres the victims rights in that Tracey now helps other victims of crime alongside campaigning for a change in the law on unduly lenient sentences as she knows her experience is far from unique  Victims code All victims of crime have a set of rights set out in the Victims Code which includes a right to information and the right to make a victim impact statement But the Crime Survey of England and Wales found that in 201718 only oneinfive victims had heard of it  The code has recently been updated and the new version comes into effect on 1 April 2021 But despite  successive Conservative governments pledging to enshrine the rights into law  since 2015 legislation has yet to be put to Parliament  Labours Mr Kyle is increasing the pressure by introducing his own Victims Bill to Parliament saying putting the code on a legal footing is the baseline  with any law needing to go much further He said that too often there is no link between the victim and the system which can lead to cases failing and while it was not the fault of individuals working for criminal justice it must be addressed We have a system that unfortunately has focused so much on their part in bringing people to justice that its forgotten and squeezed out the victims themselves said the Labour MP I think that our criminal justice system will never be able to deliver the justice thats deserved and make sure that victims feel that justice has been done for them unless we can reconnect victims to the criminal justice system itself  Mr Kyle said his bill would introduce consequences into the system to make victims rights unignorable What would Labours Victims Law include image copyright Getty Images Ensuring victims are read their rights at the same time as perpetrators Creating a register for people who run departments in the justice system which routinely ignore victims rights Giving victims of persistent antisocial behaviour the same rights as victims of crimes Making the Victims Commissioner independent of government and able to launch their own investigations The Conservatives promised again in their manifesto at the 2019 election to introduce a Victims Law But Vera Baird QC the Victims Commissioner for England and Wales said the need for a law really gets more urgent as time goes by She said there had been a significant fall in confidence about the criminal justice system from victims and she saw the results in her office day to day  Ms Baird added We urgently need victims rights to be put into law  They are not hard to do and they dont attack the

Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics George Floyd death image copyright Getty Images image caption Police stand in Washington DC with a Black Lives Matter sign in the background When massive protests against police brutality broke out across the US in May 2020 Charles Billups was not at all surprised A black policeman in New York for decades before his retirement the former officer 60 tells the BBC Its the chickens coming home to roost  This is something thats been mustering for a while says Mr Billups Not for the first time has anger against law enforcement in America spilt out into demands for change  national attempts to reform the countrys patchwork of nearly 18000 police departments have periodically cropped up since the early 20th Century But outrage over a spate of deaths of black Americans at the hands of police especially the death of George Floyd a former club bouncer asphyxiated during an arrest has spurred a clear bout of soulsearching within police departments themselves Officers are divided over if and how reforms should come about  For Mr Billups now chairman of the Grand Council of Guardians an organisation for AfricanAmerican law enforcement officers in New York state the problems lie at the top Oldschool thinking  A policy of tough policing put forward in the 1980s the socalled broken windows theory has long been destructive for relations between minorities and law enforcement Mr Billups says image copyright East Bay Times via Getty Images image caption Richmond California police officers stand with antiracism protesters Only recently have authorities begun to step away from more draconian principles but Mr Billups thinks that a belief in the efficacy of tough tactics persists among the mostly white and longentrenched leadership of many police departments  The head is the thinker The bodys going to conform to the head If the head is not healthy the bodys not going to gain weight You gotta change the top says Mr Billups Its a large number of people who believe in oldschool policing thats still running a lot of these agencies and the oldschool way of thinking just doesnt work no more Black officers have always known and felt differently says Terence Hopkins of the Dallas police department  We happen to be AfricanAmerican people before we were law enforcement he says so that gives us a different view as opposed to our white counterparts Whats changed since George Floyds death Surveys bear this out A 2016 poll of nearly 8000 US police oficers by the Pew Research think tank found that 69 of black officers believed that the country needed to continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites compared to just 6 of white officers The survey taken in the aftermath of another spate of fatal encounters between police and AfricanAmericans found that a majority of white and Latino officers believed such events were isolated incidents media caption Eric Garners death inspires an unlikely police experiment By contrast 57 of black officers said they were signs of a broader problem with policing Polls of police in the wake of the recent fatal encounters have yet to emerge but anecdotally more officers today seem to agree that the problem goes beyond individuals and needs a systematic approach White as well as black officers have supported the protests and have publicly called for reforms  Change v status quo Whats happening now is a movement for police reform in our country says Mr Hopkins who has been a police officer for 30 years Officer to be fired over Breonna Taylor shooting Timeline of US police killings Some of the ideas that have become popular in the larger cultural conversation such as diverting money and duties to fund mental health and social work he agrees with wholeheartedly he says  More must be done to recruit minority officers In Dallas there is a conscious policy to make the force reflect the demographics of the city it serves  But Mr Hopkins says he also understands why there is resistance to change media caption Antonio Smith is suing the city of Valdosta Georgia and its police department over a violent wrongful arrest You tend to be protective of your industry When individuals say youre doing something wrong we tend to go the other direction or not admit our fault in it  Mr Billups agrees that its a big split You have one faction thats saying theres a need for change and then you have another faction in these departments that want to keep it as status quo image copyright Boston Globe via Getty Images image caption Some police have joined protesters in taking a knee in commemoration of George Floyd Some officers have expressed anger over the backlash on policing and calls to defund or disband departments though these are not always calls to abolish police as some have taken them to mean  A viral video circulated in recent weeks of members of the New York Benevolent Association seen as a traditionally more conservative union for rankandfile officers venting at perceived mistreatment of police amid the protests Stop treating us like animals and thugs Mike OMeara head of the union tells reporters I am not Derek Chauvin They are not him he said referring to the police officer who killed George Floyd in Minneapolis Everybodys trying to shame us The legislators The press Everybodys trying to shame us into being embarrassed of our profession he says Weve been left out of the conversation Weve been vilified Its disgusting On Facebook Blue Lives Matter  a counter group to Black Lives Matter that advocates for police interest  has over 22m endorsers media caption What happened when a city disbanded its police force Supporters say police deserve sympathy for doing a difficult job and that radical proposals to disband departments would lead to anarchy and lawlessness  Indeed such reforms can have mixed results Camden a workingclass town in New Jersey has been hailed as a model for success after disbanding its troubled police force in 2013 redirecting energies to neighbourhood patrolling  However in Vallejo California outside San Francisco fatal encounters with police rose dramatically in the years after it disbanded force in 2008  Its just really tough says Robert McCormick a retired police and parole officer Everybody wants a simple answer but there isnt one There are many complexities even with reforms that sound reasonable he points out  For example getting mental health specialists to deal with issues police are not equipped to deal with  a large chunk of calls Mr McCormick 72 saw in his decades on the job in the Midwest and Colorado  would seem prudent  But officers would have no way of knowing when they answer an emergency 911 call that mental illness is the issue at hand  Police kill Canadian man during mental health check Dont shoot Im disabled  how to stop deaths involving police With nearly one in three Americans owning a gun risks for officers can be high  Rather than reducing funds Mr McCormick thinks there should be supplemental funds for training and alternative resources for police  image copyright Getty Images image caption Protesters call for spending on police departments to be cut He thinks protections for police do need to remain in place such as preserving qualified immunity  another concept that has come under pressure amid the recent protests  The doctrine shields officers from being held personally liable for violating the constitutional rights of people they arrest  Critics argue that this thwarts attempts to hold officers accountable but Mr McCormick says it is necessary to protect police who are trying to do their jobs It says you cant sue me just for arresting you just for doing my job he says  The police are being attacked he says But on the other hand its so damned hard to get rid of a cop whos bad or not doing his jobâ¦ its pretty damn near impossible to convict a cop Thats ridiculous Ultimately it will be changes that take place within departments themselves that affect longterm results thinks the Grand Councils Mr Billups  The key thing now is that theres changes in the department he says Youre talking about officers who are black or Latino They go back to those same neighbourhoods where theyre policing So a lot of the young black officers see it a different way But more importantly he says it is that police departments as a whole need to learn a new language to evaluate the purpose and priorities of the job Departments need to evolve to the 21st Century  Cops Need a New Code Jeremiah Johnson serves as a police sergeant in Connecticut and holds an appointment as a Practitioner in Residence at the University of New Haven It took several days before I could bring myself to watch George Floyds life agonisingly extinguished beneath the unyielding knee of a Minneapolis police officer As a sworn police officer I believe it is my duty to watch and not look away George Floyds humanity demands it  His unconscionable death laid bare the deficiencies of American policing a reality which resonated with cities and communities across the nation Viral images and video clips documenting protests against racism and brutality have done little to disconfirm that the police are racist and brutal Calls to reimagine defund or even abolish the institution of policing are amplified through these encounters  A friend from my undergraduate days recently lamented on Facebook that she did not know how to explain the police to her children Rhetorical or not I inquired whether she meant police as they are or police as they should be  Policing is a social institution with an uncertain mandate and mismatched expectations invariably leads to conflict Reductionist phrases such as to serve and protect are of little help as they are ambiguous and easily coopted  The field of policing desperately needs to do some soulsearching and reconsider what it stands for professionally Rewriting its code of ethics is a good place to start The current Law Enforcement Code of Ethics is a product of the mid20th Centurys professional era of policing It was formally adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1957  The document is more than symbolic many police organisations including the Minneapolis Police Department have incorporated the Code of Ethics into their policy manuals and oath of office ceremonies Police reform often takes place in a patchwork fashion  Changing the Code of Ethics would be unprecedented and widereaching To draft a new Code of Ethics worthy of a democratic society policing should turn to Hippocrates Medicines Hippocratic Oath is commonly summarised as do no harm  It is the physicians job to examine the patient diagnose the medical condition underlying presenting symptoms and prescribe an effective course of treatment A doctor who only attends to visible symptoms provides ineffective medicine or treats in a manner that is ultimately harmful has failed the patient  By these standards American policing may be guilty of malpractice  A police code of ethics designed around the Hippocratic Oath should incorporate four key themes that are noticeably absent from the present document evidencebased policing crime prevention professional identity and the sanctity of life In the decades following the codes inception a vast body of scientific evidence has emerged regarding what works in policing and perhaps more importantly what does not  This is not an abstract intellectual issue since police interventions directly impact the lives of community members Ignoring the evidence base in favour of tradition or personal opinion is more than irresponsible unscientific policing is unethical policing   Second the Code of Ethics is a product of the crimecontrol era and is singularly focused on enforcement The desire to apprehend is dominant in American policings DNA yet this orientation must give way to crime prevention It is the absence of crime and disorder that policing should seek to achieve   Third the Code of Ethics must repudiate the ideology of the thin blue line It must clearly establish that police are first and foremost members of the community not some separate caste standing in the gap between good and evil Finally the Code of Ethics rightly speaks to protecting the weak and innocent while opposing unnecessary force and violence This does not go far enough  Policing must fundamentally acknowledge the sanctity of life and a duty to protect every person even individuals who have placed themselves or others in jeopardy If police must use force they have an ethical duty to transition and render aid to prevent the loss of life As George Floyd lay dying one of the bystanders in the crowd tried to reason with the officers declaring Bro hes human The appeal fell on deaf ears  Hippocrates viewed the art of medicine as something fundamentally connected with the love of humanity The very fabric of American policing must change before the same can be said about law enforcement Its time for a new code Related Topics US police killings George Floyd death

Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Stanford sexual assault case image copyright Jared StappBBC Students at Californias Stanford University have used digital technology to show support for prominent sexual assault survivor Chanel Miller But it comes amid unhappiness at how the university is remembering the attack  Using augmented reality the students projected her words onto the site on campus where she was assaulted in 2015  The area has been turned into a contemplative garden  but there was a disagreement over the choice of words for a plaque and it was never installed Students fear this means people now dont know what the garden signifies The Dear Visitor exhibit saw people using iPads and headphones to see and hear the words Ms Miller wrote to attacker Brock Turner in her victim impact statement  It was written under the pseudonym Emily Doe and went viral after being published online   Chanel Miller tells her story A jury found Turner then 20 guilty of three charges sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her Ms Miller was found near a dumpster by two Swedish students Turner was given a controversially short sixmonth jail term of which he served three months He was placed on probation and remains on the sex offenders register  image copyright Dear Visitor There is currently no plaque and no plans to install one after the university rejected the words Ms Miller chose to be used   The creators of  Dear Visitor   all students or former students at Stanford  wanted Fridays augmented reality project followed by a solidarity event to go some way towards righting that wrong Window to alternative world Hope Schroeder said We want to elevate Chanel Millers voice in this space as was intended Its not a replacement but an addition to a physical plaque She said there were also fears the site was not being used as intended  with beer cans and vape cartridges found in the garden  and that its meaning could be forgotten  The exhibit involved students being given iPads equipped with an augmented reality app to allow them to see what it would look like if a plaque had been installed in the garden  It gives them a window to an alternative world she said We were able to install digital objects that look like theyre there We also took the opportunity to interview students about the issue We thought there was a risk as time goes on students in five or 10 years could not know what the garden was about So students letters can be clicked on as well We then invite people to write letters of their own  image copyright Dear Visitor image caption The augmented reality plaque  the final version saw the name Emily Doe replaced with Chanel Miller image copyright Dear Visitor The Dear Visitor team contacted Ms Miller whose memoir Know My Name was released this week to get her goahead for the project  She liked the idea and we received her consent to use her actual voice in the space added Ms Schoeder The students also consulted sexual assault experts to make sure the experience would be thoughtful and informative  Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber who led the successful drive to recall Judge Aaron Persky had also been involved in the creation of the garden  She said the first priority had been safety describing the dimlylit area as a rape trap But she said that after preventing an attack happening there again the next goal was to acknowledge the harm  Stanford had agreed to a plaque if the words were taken from the victim impact statement Ms Millers first and second choices of wording were rejected by the university They offered their own suggestions but Ms Miller did not feel they were appropriate  One suggestion was Im right here Im okay everythings okay Im right here  words Ms Miller spoke to her sister after the assault  but the next paragraph explains what Ms Miller was keeping hidden and that she was not at all OK  Survivors are in this together Professor Dauber said This young woman has been damaged enough This was literally the least Stanford could do  With Chanels book coming out I think an appropriate reaction by Stanford would be to rethink their decision about the plaque and put it up as they promised They broke a promise to someone who has been severely harmed  Student Sabrina Medler is a sexual assault survivor in her final year at Stanford who wrote about her own experiences this week saying  reading Chanel Millers victim impact statement had empowered her   Ms Medler said she often visits the garden and has felt peace there She said Survivors have reacted to it differently Ive always found the space comforting When Im there I feel a connection to Chanel Miller It makes me feel like survivors are in this together   But she acknowledged it was also felt to be a reminder of the aftermath of the case adding that Stanford had failed to do justice to Ms Miller  She has now organised a campus petition asking for Stanford to publicly apologise for not installing a plaque with the words Ms Miller had chosen image copyright Getty Images A Stanford University spokesman said After creating the garden we worked very hard to get agreement on a physical quote for the space and we regret that wasnt achievable  The university wanted to ensure the space would provide a supportive environment for all survivors not all of whom may have reached the same point of posttraumatic healing and who might have a range of emotional reactions  We welcome this studentled initiative that offers the use of augmented reality in the space and provides visitors the agency to engage with the garden and its purpose   The university also said a  statement made by Provost Persis Drell  in March 2018 still stood where she explained Stanfords decision In it she says it was felt Ms Millers words expressed sentiments that would not be supportive in a healing space  She added that the sexual assault had changed our community forever and that Stanford was working to create and nurture a culture where similar events do not happen in future  Related Topics Universities United States

Related Topics CES image copyright Getty Images image caption Brad Smith presented Microsofts first CES keynote speech since 2012 Microsofts president has called the SolarWinds hack an mass indiscriminate global assault that should be a wakeup call to cyberdefenders Brad Smith was making a keynote speech at the CES technology trade show Earlier it emerged Presidentelect Joe Biden had created a new post for a former National Security Agency official to help determine the US response to the attack Anne Neuberger had specialised in operations against Russia Preemptive strike Plans to appoint her to the role of deputy national security adviser for cybersecurity within the National Security Council  were first reported by Politico  and have now been  confirmed by the New York Times  The NYT said she had run the NSAs Russia Small Group responsible for a preemptive strike on Kremlin operatives in 2018  She is currently head of the agencys Cybersecurity Directorate US intelligence agencies believe Russia was behind the SolarWinds attack which compromised email accounts at the US Department of Justice as well as giving the perpetrators access to the systems of government agencies businesses and other organisations worldwide The full extent of the attack has yet to emerge  The Kremlin has denied involvement Mass assault SolarWinds sells a widely used network monitoring tool that was altered to provide the hackers with a backdoor Microsoft was among the victims and has confirmed some of its source code  the normally inaccessible instructions behind its software  had been accessed Governments have spied on each other for centuries it would be naive to think or even ask them to stop said Mr Smith in his keynote But weve long lived in a world where there were norms and rules that created expectations about what was appropriate and what was not  And what happened with SolarWinds was not Why Because this wasnt a case of one nation simply trying to spy on or hack its way into a computer network of another It was a mass indiscriminate global assault on the technology supply chain that all of us are responsible for protecting It is a danger that the world cannot afford Covid crisis Security experts needed to learn one of the lessons of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks which had exposed how different US government agencies had failed to share threat information Mr Smith said We need to move as the 911 Commission said from a culture where people only gave others information when they had a need to know he said And in the words of that commission change the culture so that people feel a need to share Mr Smith also said there was a greater need to work together to tackle attacks linked to the Covid crisis We have lived through the biggest pandemic in a century he said And what did some people use that pandemic to do  To launch cyberattacks against hospitals against the public health sector against the World Health Organization against the first line of critical responders This too should be off limits image copyright Getty Images image caption Ms Neuberger led efforts to protect the USs 2018 midterm elections Ms Neuberger will now be responsible for trying to persuade US agencies and the countrys wider cybersecurity sector to work together against such threats In her previous role she coordinated the response of US government agencies to a flaw her team discovered suspected Russian hackers were using It was really great to see five different cybersecurity entities using that to identify other Russian intelligence infrastructure and then take that down  she told CBS News in August  Last month Mr Biden said once the extent of the damage the SolarWinds hack had caused was better known the US would probably respond in kind There will be many in the cybersecurity industry who nodded along enthusiastically with Brad Smith The SolarWinds hack has stunned and terrified the sector  particularly those who make and sell software to protect us from hacks The last few weeks have been a nightmare scenario playing out in slow motion as more and more details of the scope and depth of the intrusion have been dripfed to the public For the intelligence community though at least in private its more of a case of Why didnt we think of that All nations hack each other and supply chain attacks like this  albeit not as successful  have been used in the past for spying or disruption Clearly the Biden administration is preparing to respond in some way But in truth aside from perhaps a public naming and shaming of the hackers there is little it can do directly to the perpetrators involved What happens behind closed doors is far more significant as cyberdefences will need to be rebuilt and potential offensive retaliation planned Related Topics Cybersecurity Microsoft CES More on this story UK data watchdog issues SolarWinds hack alert Published 23 December 2020 UK assessing impact of major hacking campaign

page Copy link About sharing image copyright BBCTwenty TwentyMark Bourdillon TV historian David Olusoga claims it is palpable nonsense to say that removing controversial statues somehow impoverishes history Prof Olusoga says statues such as those of slave traders are not useful ways of teaching history or explaining the values of previous eras Instead the historian argues they are a continuing public validation of people who did terrible things Prof Olusoga is to be an online school teacher himself this week Pupils in the lockdown will be able to watch Prof Olusoga explaining the importance of the census to historians  ahead of the national census in March  and looking at how it can reveal changes of populations and hidden stories At school with Gazza The University of Manchester professor recently revealed one of his own hidden histories  that he had been at primary school in Gateshead with Paul Gascoigne and the former footballer had rescued Prof Olusoga and his sister from racist bullying Barack Obama speaks to David Olusoga Marcus Rashford faces racism on social media Edward Colston statue pushed into harbour Statues get protection from baying mobs The TV presenter who had been born in Nigeria but moved to a council estate in north east England says the prejudice he faced in school was part of the Darwinian world of the 1970s playground image copyright EPA image caption Marcus Rashford faces the social media version of the prejudice of 1970s playgrounds says the historian But the historian still sees its continuation in the abuse aimed at  black footballers such as Marcus Rashford  Racism in football just found a new outlet in the world of social media If you look under that rock its there all the time Marcus because he so high profile and because we love to attack people who are doing good in this country for reasons Ive never quite understood is the focus at the moment But its constant its always there says the historian and author His lesson about the census made with the Office for National Statistics is about the lascars sailors recruited from Asia to work on British ships who often faced tough conditions for lower pay than their white counterparts They were at the centre of a trading empire that was incredibly complicated diverse and also unfair Facing up to slavery He says studying the British empire in its strengths and weaknesses is absolutely critical to understanding presentday Britain  in terms of the economy culture cuisine as well the people who are living here But when it comes to issues such as examining links with the slave trade he says there is a reluctance and a push towards distraction and deflection and various ways of saying We dont want to talk about that image caption David Olusoga won a Bafta award for his programme Britains Forgotten Slave Owners He argues that debates about statues  such as the statue to slave trader Edward Colston that was pushed into the harbour in Bristol  should face up to the historical evidence of who is being commemorated Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick recently promised more safeguards to monuments saying they are almost always best explained and contextualised  not taken and hidden away  What has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully not removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob said Mr Jenrick Prof Olusoga says there has been particular hostility to suggestions there were enslaved black people in 18th Century Britain as well as in the colonies This seems to make people deeply uncomfortable says the presenter of the A House Through Time TV series I think thats because weve created a moral firewall between what happened in Britain and what happened in the empire  with the idea that what happened in the empire doesnt really count Missing history Prof Olusoga also has concerns for future historians  and digital gaps in the historical record He says the way politicians and decisionmakers use messaging services like WhatsApp to share their private thoughts could leave future historians with much less understanding about how policies are being made Historians should be enormously worried about politicians finding ways of not leaving records of their decisions in their debates says Prof Olusoga  Thats fundamental to the workings of democracy He says written memos notes letters and emails have been ways into the thinking of politicians behind the scenes that will not be available for an era of private unrecorded messages One of the most interesting things if you study Churchill is his notes in the margin he says I think politicians need to leave a record of their deliberations and their debates that lead them to the decisions they made  so they can be held accountable by historians

copyright SAIF In Nigeria clashes between ethnic Fulanis and other groups have cost thousands of lives in the past decades and now a car salesman has emerged as a controversial national figure in this increasingly deadly conflict as the BBCs Nduka Orjinmo reports Hailed as a hero by his supporters Sunday Igboho Adeyemo is seen as a dangerous rabble rouser by his opponents accused of inciting ethnic hatred and killing Once only wellknown in his part of southwestern Nigeria he has now become one of the most talked about  and divisive  figures across the country Through a series of inflammatory statements Mr Adeyemo has been thrust into the heart of one of Nigerias most deadly ethnic divides  the conflict between Fulani herders and other groups over access to land and grazing rights Lionised in a feature film Last month after the killing of a politician Mr Adeyemo felt he had seen enough and captured attention with his demand that the Fulani herders from northern Nigeria leave the southwest seen as the home of the Yoruba ethnic group for all their alleged crimes But this selfstyled defender of the defenceless popularly known as Igboho  after his hometown in southwest Oyo state  is no stranger to controversy and deadly conflict  The 48yearold has been lionised locally for his role in the late 1990s in ageold intraYoruba communal battles His reputed exploits were acted out in a feature film that was a fantastical display of magic charms and juju In one scene where rival gangs face off the actor playing Mr Adeyemo arrives on a motorcycle picks up a poisoned banana and calmly eats half of it without feeling any ill effects He then plucks a machine gun out of thin air and fires at his opponents who flee in every direction That film and other tales about him such as that he walks around with a snake around his neck have contributed to a local reputation of invincibility  Who is Sunday Adeyemo Born in 1972 in Igboho Oyo state Runs a dealership selling new and secondhand cars Was a motorcycle mechanic in his early years Has a foundation named after him that caters to the needy It is not clear how he came into the car business that he operates out of the city of Ibadan but he seems to have made a success of it selling everything from new Rolls Royces to secondhand Toyotas His clientele include powerful politicians and governors and he is often seen with them in public Mr Adeyemo achieved some national notoriety last October when he used the countrys independence day to call for the creation of an independent Yoruba republic although he was widely ridiculed for the idea Now though as he has become a lightning rod for local grievances he is being taken more seriously Land rights are at the core of those grievances image copyright Getty Images image caption Climate change is pushing Fulani pastoralists to go further south to graze their cattle Fulani herders and their families walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find the best grazing land for their cattle But this has often led to friction with local communities who accuse their cattle of trampling on their crops and sometimes accuse the herders of robbery and other crimes Africa Daily podcast  Why are farmers and herders fighting in Nigeria Some of the herders are also employed by rich southerners who own the cattle but employ Fulani to look after them A federal government plan approved in 2019 to  solve the problem by creating ranches for the herdsmen  was rejected by most southern governors who accused President Muhammadu Buhari a Fulani of hatching a plot to grab land for his people In the past few years clashes have become more deadly as both the Fulani and those opposed to them have set up armed selfdefence militias  In the southwest state governors established a regional security outfit Amotekun to help deal with the problems  The leopard unit vigilantes and Nigerias kidnap crisis Open grazing has also been banned in all six southwestern states Tensions were ignited in December after the killing of politician Fatai Aborode in Oyo state Mr Adeyemo decided to take matters into his own hands and told the Fulanis to go without providing any evidence of their involvement in that killing or other alleged crimes After his sevenday ultimatum expired in January he held a rally in the area where the killing took place after which the homes of some more settled Fulani who had been part of the community for generations were burned I shiver when I hear his name Abdulkadri Saliu the leader of the Fulanis in the area whose house was torched and who has now fled accused Mr Adeyemo of instigating the trouble At the mention of Igbohos name I get scared and shiver he said adding he had never seen violence like it He also alleged that his younger brother was killed image caption Abdulkadri Saliu accuses Mr Adeyemo of instigating the villagers to destroy his property which he denies Mr Adeyemo denied responsibility for the trouble saying that the police had been with him all through the time he was in the area But he also travelled to Yewa in Ogun state to evict Fulani herders There he was received by a joyous crowd and whipped them up by saying that killer herdsmen had escaped justice because the herdsmen are close to the federal government Any Fulani herdsman who engages in kidnapping should be flushed out he added Police say they are investigating both incidents but will not say if he is a suspect You may also be interested in Who are Nigerias Fulani herdsmen Facebook fake news and Fulani killings The motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria The day the pirates came His actions have been widely condemned especially by groups in northern Nigeria who accuse him of inciting ethnic violence and engaging in the unlawful eviction of citizens Some political leaders in the southwest have joined in the criticism but there has also been massive support for him in the region  Federal lawmaker Shina Peller wrote a message on Instagram saluting Mr Adeyemos courage bravery and participation in this struggle                  View this post on Instagram

where they want Mr Adeyemos sympathisers accuse the federal government of not doing enough to stop the attacks on local communities by herdsmen Benue Governor Samuel Ortom whose state was until recently the epicentre of deadly clashes between the herders and farmers believes that the crisis has been enabled by the leniency of the president towards the Fulani herders Information Minister Lai Mohammed said he would not be drawn into a reaction on the governors comments telling the BBC that Nigerians have a right to live in all parts of the country  Nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka who is from the southwest also criticised Mr Buharis silence on the activities of herders saying it could develop into a civil war media caption Wole Soyinka The war is on our doorstep What do they expect of us now that the war is on our doorstep Of course there will be mobilisation and if we keep waiting for this to be centrally handled we are all going to become if were not already slaves in our land he told the BBC Soyinka said Mr Adeyemo had responded to the situation in the way he knew how Attempts are being made to quell the tensions and even Mr Adeyemo has said he is open to talks with the government But some are now describing him as the saviour who rode up in a shiny car and rescued his people from the cattle herders  For someone who has compared himself to Biblical figures

DoS+attack|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-55572897|Viewpoint Global medias Nigeria abductions coverage wrong Published 13 January Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Nigeria schoolgirl kidnappings image caption The school in northwest Nigeria was targeted in December In our series of letters from African writers Nigerian novelist Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani criticises international media coverage of the abduction of schoolchildren in Nigeria  from that of the Chibok girls in 2014 to that of the Kankara boys last month The frenzied journalism that followed the 2014 abduction by militant Islamist group Boko Haram of more than 200 girls from their school in Chibok northeast Nigeria may have been wellmeaning but it led to some unfortunate outcomes  Prior to the Chibok incident Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau was just a fringe figure that Nigerians saw on TV once in a while  When he stabbed at the camera with his fingers and guffawed wildly while threatening everyone from Nigerias thenPresident Goodluck Jonathan to the US president at the time Barack Obama with death and destruction many of us wondered Who did this unkempt man really think he was  But in the aftermath of Chibok media organisations around the world broadcast and rebroadcast Shekaus slightest remark  And he kept them supplied with material such as videos of the kidnapped schoolgirls whom he promised to sell  image copyright AFP image caption Some of the Chibok victims met President Muhammadu Buhari after they were freed in 2017 Those who were abducted have subsequently described how the militants who held them captive revelled in any news about the incident The Chibok coverage inflated Shekaus value as a media commodity making it increasingly rewarding to keep him on the airwaves  It also distorted the story itself  Despite the way it was covered by the international media the Chibok kidnappings had nothing to do with an attack on girls education rather it was banditry gone wrong  When they were released after more than two years in Boko Haram captivity some of those held described how the militants who attacked their school were simply on a mission to loot and steal  Militants build a global brand After emptying out the schools storeroom of food they were then left with the problem of what to do with the students and began arguing  One suggested that that they lock the girls in a dormitory and set them on fire Another suggested that they use the girls to gain access to their parents homes nearby and then steal some more food  Eventually one man came up with the idea that would lead to infamy Let us take them to Shekau He will know what to do  image copyright The Office of First Lady image caption The Chibok kidnapping sparked a global social media campaign that included thenUS First Lady Michelle Obama This same account was recorded in a report by New Yorkbased group Human Rights Watch  based on interviews with some of the 57 students who managed to escape on the night of the kidnapping by jumping off the trucks used to ferry them away  Although published a few months after the incident little attention was paid to that detail  Determined to make the Boko Haram attacks about the irresistible theme of terrorists targeting female education some media outlets ignored any thread that did not fit this narrative  Just a few weeks before the Chibok incident Boko Haram had attacked a school in the northeast town of Burni Yadi and allowed female students to flee before slaughtering 40 boys in their dormitory  The Burni Yadi incident attracted little media attention until after the Chibok kidnappings but this additional knowledge did nothing to sway the direction of reporting  In many cases the media insisted on viewing the Chibok incident through the lens of gender violence unwittingly providing Boko Haram with the guidance they needed to build their global brand   Boko Harams use of women as suicide bombers skyrocketed after the Chibok kidnappings  according to a 2017 report by Combating Terrorism Center  at West Point and Yale University suggesting that the group adopted the tactic to grab headlines and elicit shock and awe  It soon became the first terror group in history to use more female suicide bombers than male sending at least 80 women to their deaths in 2017 alone  Through the global response to the Chibok abductions the insurgents learned the potent symbolic value of young female bodies that using them as bombers would attract attention said Hilary Matfess coauthor of the report  Celebrity monster In February 2018 another 110 girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram from their school in the northeast town of Dapchi   In the past few years the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has severely curtailed Boko Harams impact in northeast Nigeria  Its attacks are much fewer their hold on international headlines lasting for hours rather than what used to be days or months But another security crisis has risen elsewhere  Gunmen popularly referred to by government officials and local media as bandits have been terrorising northwest Nigeria with robberies and kidnappings  Politicians entrepreneurs commuters and even schoolchildren have been kidnapped at various times and released after a ransom was paid although not on the scale seen in December when more than  300 boys were abducted from their boarding school  on the outskirts of Kankara town last month  media caption Abdulhadi Abubaka described to the BBC last month how he managed to escape the mass kidnapping at his school near Kankara Nigerian security agents and officials of the Kankara community stated that the boys were taken by bandits But when the international media swooped in and amplified the apparent link to the Chibok incident of more than six years before Shekau must have seen an opportunity  A whole three days after the Kankara kidnapping Boko Haram said it was behind the attack And once again many international outlets presented their platforms for this celebrity monster to dance and display And in the process ran wild with a faulty narrative ignoring all evidence to the contrary Shekaus megalomaniac commentary The numerous headlines that unquestioningly attributed the Kankara kidnappings to Boko Haram failed to consider by what miracle the group had expanded from its decimated operations in the northeast to the northwest two regions that are vast and separate  Not even in its prime did Boko Haram brazenly operate in the northwest  The most the militants achieved was a few albeit deadly suicide bomb attacks  In a similar manner by which he fanned his popularity in 2014 Shekau fed the media with megalomaniac commentary and a video allegedly of the Kankara boys        Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani The voices of the parents were drowned in the sea of global media coverage which appeared unbending in the determination to connect this incident with Chibok Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani Novelist and journalist Local media while worried about the increasing insecurity in Nigeria was more sceptical about the Boko Haram angle  When Nigerias Cable newspaper took the time to show the video to some of the parents many of whom do not have internet facilities and so had to rely on secondary sources to view it they described the recording as fake  Why are they playing tricks on us the parents asked This video is not genuine It does not show our children  Nevertheless the voices of the parents were drowned in the sea of global media coverage which appeared unbending in the determination to connect this incident with Chibok  image copyright Reuters image caption Students left their footwear behind in the scramble that followed the attack in Kankara Some international security experts suggested that while direct Boko Haram involvement seems to have been discounted Boko Haram training help and encouragement were involved  Many Nigerians believe that Boko Haram took interest only after the international media covered the story The government insisted no ransom was paid to the kidnappers who it continued to describe as bandits Media coverage of such heinous acts is important governments need to be encouraged to act victims need to be remembered and memorialised and the public needs to be warned  But all this can be done without inspiring

gallery A third is a mother who refused to accept a farright election campaign leaflet  What they all have in common is that they stood up against rightwing extremism Their cars have been torched Molotov cocktails have been thrown against their houses and their windows have been smashed with bricks NeoNazi death threats have been daubed in red paint on to the walls of homes  But this is not a crimeridden area The southern end of the Berlin district of NeukÃ¶lln where these people live is peaceful and leafy Full of carefully tended gardens and spotless pavements it is a residential middleclass idyll on the edge of the city  Heinz Ostermann runs a bookshop in a quiet shopping street In December 2016 shortly after the rightwing populist AfD won seats in the national parliament he

posters  one of them reads Migration Kills  he says there is no evidence that these crimes have been committed by the NPD or the far right Instead he blames the violence on migrants  There are Sunni Muslim Arabs who are criminals who act as part of criminal clans who are competing with each other In some of these cases it cannot be ruled out that people have been hit by criminal violence because of these competing gangs  Just how far to the right is AfD Is there a growing farright threat online Police are treating these incidents as farright crimes NeukÃ¶lln is a large district home to more

and he has had to be resuscitated on 25 occasions  But last year the 44yearold from Beith North Ayrshire managed to run the London Marathon  He says his health improved markedly after a vital appointment with an asthma nurse about his inhaler Now he is backing a new campaign urging others to use their medication properly Experts say more than a million people in the UK could be at risk of a lifethreatening asthma attack as they do not get their inhaler technique checked image copyright Antonio GuillemGetty Images Mr Wilson admits he missed out on vital inhaler technique checks with his GP as he did not attend his annual asthma reviews  He said Ive been rushed to hospital countless times with my asthma and been put on drips nebulisers and even ended up in intensive care  But Id never really given too much thought on how to manage my asthma or use my inhaler properly  Looking back I was just taking a puff and hoping for the best Asthma UK advice videos on how to use your inhaler The consequences of his poor technique could have proved fatal He added My symptoms were getting so severe that it got to the point where I was having an asthma attack every week  I would wake up in the middle of the night gasping for breath and it felt like someone was sitting on my chest image copyright sturtiGetty Images The results of an appointment with his asthma nurse to review his medication were startling Mr Wilson recalled They said the way I was using my inhaler meant that only 1020 of the medicine was getting into my lungs  They showed me the correct inhaler technique and gave me a spacer to use and the difference it has made to my asthma is incredible I even ran the London Marathon for Asthma UK last year  I never thought that something so simple could completely turn my life around Other stories you might like Viewer spots mystery face in the clouds Childrens play parks drive boost in visitor numbers Scotland and England take different paths on fracking An Asthma UK report found nearly one in five 19 people are not getting their inhaler technique checked The charity said research also shows that almost half of people with asthma are not using their inhaler properly often without realising  This means the full dose of medicine cannot get into their lungs where it is needed to protect them from a lifethreatening asthma attack  Instead the medicine stays in their mouth or the back of their throat which can also make people more likely to experience side effects such as oral thrush and a sore throat image copyright Getty Images According to national guidelines everyone with asthma should get their inhaler technique checked as part of their yearly asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse  The charity has also  launched videos on its website  which demonstrate how to use more than 21 different inhalers spacers or nasal sprays including pMDI Turbohaler and HandiHaler It is also urging patients and parents of children with asthma to attend their asthma reviews and watch the videos with their GP or asthma nurse so they can be mindful of how to use their inhaler properly Common mistakes include breathing too forcefully or not forcefully enough not breathing in deeply enough or not preparing their inhaler properly such as shaking it before use image copyright PA If people are struggling to get their inhaler technique right it can also help if they use a spacer a hollow chamber that attaches to the inhaler and makes it easier for the medicine to get into the lungs Dr Andy Whittamore clinical lead at Asthma UK said Inhalers are the breadandbutter treatment for most people with asthma so its really worrying that many people are not taking them properly or getting their technique checked by their GP or asthma nurse With so many different types of inhaler which are all used in different ways it can be difficult for patients and healthcare professionals to know the correct way to use them  Its also easy for patients to get into bad habits or simply forget the best technique following their appointment especially if they have a new type of inhaler But even a small tweak to how someone uses their inhaler can make a huge difference and could prevent them having a lifethreatening asthma attack Related Topics Asthma Beith London Marathon More on this story UK young more likely to die from asthma Published 20 February

and even a van as part of an attack Whatever the position in 2017 he was unquestionably preparing for terrorism in 2019 image copyright Julia Quenzler image caption A courtroom sketch showing Chowdhury earlier on in his trial at Woolwich Crown Court The fresh investigation into Chowdhury began when his social media posts immediately after his acquittal suggested police should still regard him as a highrisk suspect  The posts included messages echoing jihadist propaganda including his hopes for a battlefield death That was enough for the police and MI5 to believe he had hit the ground running for a new attack  and the undercover team was sent in The officers known only as Mikael Hamza and Zulf slowly worked their way into Chowdhurys life over the first six months of 2019 The operation began when Zulf and a fourth officer posing as his uncle went to the chicken takeaway shop in Luton where Chowdhury worked  There they had a conversation within the suspects earshot that implied that the uncle was heading to Pakistan to fight and die The plan to spark his interest appeared to have worked When Zulf later returned with a new undercover officer Hamza Chowdhury wanted to befriend them  Mikael was then introduced into the circle and he appeared as a leader figure  sharing his aspirations for a violent attack and telling one of the others to provide the suspect with a mobile phone  Tearful and emotional Under the rules for undercover deployments police officers are allowed to pose as terrorists  but not to incite the suspect to carry out an attack Their job is to use their cover to gather evidence of what the targeted individual intends to do  And slowly over the weeks that followed Chowdhury opened up He revealed himself to be the man acquitted of the Buckingham Palace incident and told the officers he had felt peace before the botched attack  He said he had wanted to kill a Buckingham Palace soldier  and smiled when he told Mikael that he believed Allah had intervened to ensure he walked out of court free  image copyright EPA image caption The London Pride parade was among the potential targets the court heard The officer Zulf said Chowdhury could recite passages of the Koran that concerned violence from the top of his head  a classic sign that an individual had steeped themselves in jihadist ideology  During one meeting Chowdhury played part of the video that was livestreamed on Facebook by the farright killer who attacked a mosque in New Zealand That attack which led to 52 deaths had been a winwin Chowdhury remarked It only makes us more angryâ¦ we should be angry Speaking in court from behind a screen Mikael said Chowdhury had shown interest in carrying out an act of terror on many many occasions but never explicitly set out what his plan was He had also repeatedly encouraged the officer to go ahead with his own plans becoming tearful or emotional when they discussed attacks  At one point the university dropout became animated at the idea of attacking Gay Pride in London The parade would be a good target said Chowdhury because of its pisspoor securityâ¦  the way they march they are asking to get hit by some jihadist  image caption He posted a cartoon on Instagram with a comment my wife After months of building a relationship officer Mikael told Chowdhury he had obtained a gun for his own plans  and the suspect immediately asked if he could get one too  He told the officers of his training regime and sought to involve them in firearmsrelated training said prosecutor Duncan Atkinson  He told them of what he was wanting and planning to do and sought to involve them in the carrying out of one or more terrorist attacks Im doing an attack On 17 June last year Chowdhury allegedly posted a cartoon of a battle scene The caption read I have no time to ponder questions Now is the time to strike and kill Three days later Mikael met the suspect again to confirm he had got him a gun  and to ask whether he genuinely wanted it  Chowdhury did not answer the question directly  but shook his head He then said he was waiting for another man from prison to join him Unbeknown to him Chowdhurys home had been bugged and the recordings revealed that he had been showing his sister Sneha how to use a knife as a weapon A knife and wooden training swords  bought via his sisters bank account  were later found in the home and there were cut marks on Chowdhurys canvascovered wardrobe  On the same day he met Mikael to consider taking a gun Chowdhury was recorded at home telling his sister Im doing another attack bruv  She replied that he was having a a down day but he retorted No Im serious bro  its about time now It was this conversation that led to Sneha being found guilty of failing to disclose information about terrorist acts  Both Mohiussunnath Chowdhury and Sneha Chowdhury were arrested in July 2019  days before Londons Gay Pride  image copyright Met Police image caption Sneha Chowdhury was accused of doing nothing to stop her brothers plans During his defence Chowdhury told the trial that some of his extremism including support of the Charlie Hebdo attack in Paris  was just jihadi banter  He said he had become used to this kind of talk while in prison during his earlier trials before adding it was hard to have sympathy for anyone who insulted his prophet  Recordings of him discussing violent attacks with his sister including decapitation were simply part of his interest in martial arts and video games he insisted  And his own barrister told the trial that his client was an attentionseeking pathetic little man Simon Csoka QC said What you really have with Mr Chowdhury is someone who when you strip away that talkâ¦ who talks and talks and talks but doesnt do Would a terrorist after being acquitted at one trial start publishing things for the whole world to see These postsâ¦ are all consistent with someone who is childish and attentionseeking But Commander Richard Smith head of counterterrorism at the Metropolitan Police said Mohiussunnath Chowdhury is an exceptionally dangerous individual  the evidence in this trial demonstrated his intention to murder as many people as he could  and potentially to die in that attempt We felt that Chowdhury posed a significant threat  but we needed to determine whether his mindset was such that he would really carry out an attack This was not empty talk Related Topics Luton Buckingham Palace More on this story Man plotted terror attacks on tourist hot spots Published 8 January 2020

it worse as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone image copyright Getty Images image caption If you thought your cybersecurity had been compromised would you know how to contact your IT department With  one in three UK workers currently based exclusively at home  and the  same level in the US  this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the IT security bosses of companies large and small around the world And studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should For example one in five UK home workers has received no training on cybersecurity  according to a recent survey by legal firm Hayes Connor Solicitors  The report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first Meanwhile a separate UK study last year found that  57 of IT decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach In the rush and panic to set remote working practices up even simple data protection practices were ignored says Christine Sabino a senior associate at Hayes Connor image copyright Hayes Connor image caption Christine Sabino fears that in the haste to set up home working some firms ignored cybersecurity issues Companies did not provide additional security relating to computers electronic communication phone communication So what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible Ted Harrington a San Diegobased cybersecurity specialist and author of Hackable How To Do Application Security Right says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop While many larger companies may well have done this not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so but Mr Harrington stresses its importance Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned controlled and configured by the company he says This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants image copyright Ted Harrington image caption Ted Harrington says that workers should not be too scared to report a possible cybersecurity breach Definitely dont have staff using their personal computers for work says Sam Grubb an Arkansasbased cybersecurity consultant and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it he says So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen This might affect the work you are doing or in a worstcase scenario lead to the compromise of coworkers devices or other company devices such as servers Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a  VPN or virtual private network  so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firms servers and everyone else in the company image copyright Getty Images image caption Should firms give home workers shredders Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities he says Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers lions and bears you drive through the underground tunnel where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side However even with work laptops VPNs and the latest cybersecurity software systems in place staff can still make damaging mistakes such as falling prey to a phishing email  a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some  that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid19 or invited to have the vaccine  They ask the recipient to clink on the link which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer New Tech Economy  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape For this reason both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cybersecurity training Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face says Mr Grubb  Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit She says for example that employees should avoid talking about work on social media while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out image copyright Tsedal Neeley image caption Harvard Universitys Tsedal Neeley says that staff need to know who to call in the IT department With even the most cybersecurity aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to If an employee falls victim to an attack make sure that they know a who to contact and b that their outreach is welcome and wont result in termination he says You dont want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes Tsedal Neeley a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cybersecurity problems to Engaging with their firms ITcybersecurity experts is crucial she says Peter the computer network manager says this engagement should be frequent Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100 confident about and it does not hurt to ask your IT department It is better to check than be compromised Related Topics

sharing image copyright AFPGetty image caption The demand for Bitcoin appeared on departure screens at a Frankfurt station 2017 has been a bumper year for malware outbreaks We had the WannaCry worm causing havoc around the world for days followed most recently by the Petya outbreak But they are not the first to spread so far so fast The history of technology and the net has been regularly punctuated by outbreaks and infections   The Morris worm In 1988 just as the internet was starting to catch on computer science student Robert T Morris was curious about just how big it had grown He wrote a small program that travelled around logging the servers it visited Bugs in his code made it scan the net very aggressively so every server ended up running multiple copies of the worm Each copy used up a little bit of processing power so the servers gradually slowed to a halt The scanning traffic clogged the net making it almost unusable It took days to clean up the infection Mr Morris was caught and found guilty of computer fraud and was fined 10050 Â£7785 These days he is a computer scientist at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology MIT The Morris worm has one strange parallel with WannaCry Mr Morris was the son of the NSAs chief scientist and the WannaCry worm is based on code stolen from the NSA  ILOVEYOU image copyright Getty Images image caption Unromantic In May 2000 millions of Windows users found endless copies of an email bearing the subject line ILOVEYOU in their inboxes It spread so far and so fast thanks to the boobytrapped file attached to it Opening the file fired up the small program it contained which sent a copy of the same message to all the addresses found in a victims address book It was also helped to spread because all those messages appeared to come from someone a recipient knew And the subject line made people curious too ILOVEYOU rattled around the world for almost two weeks racking up more than 50 million infections Highprofile victims included the CIA Pentagon and UK Parliament  Philippine students Reonel Ramones and Onel de Guzman were found to be the creators of ILOVEYOU They escaped prosecution because there were no computer misuse laws in the Philippines at that time Code Red image copyright Getty Images image caption A warning about the worm was issued at Carnegie Mellon University Active in July 2001 and named after the fizzy pop being drunk by the researchers who found it this worm targeted web servers running Microsoft IIS software  It caused severe disruption and many websites small businesses and larger firms were knocked offline for a while  Noone has ever been named as Code Reds creator although on servers it compromised it displayed a message suggesting it originated in China  Like Wannacry Code Red exploited a known bug and caught out servers that had not been updated with a patch  SQL Slammer image copyright Getty Images image caption This internet cafe in South Korea was practically empty after an SQL Slammer infection in 2003 This worm emerged in January 2003 and was so virulent that it is believed to have slowed down traffic across the entire net as it spread Slammer was a tiny program roughly 376 bytes that did little more than create random net addresses and then send itself to those places If it hit a machine running a vulnerable version of Microsofts SQL server that machine got infected and then started spraying out more copies seeking more victims The slowdown was caused by net routers struggling to cope with the massive amounts of traffic Slammer generated while seeking out new hosts  Again a patch was available for the bug it exploited but many people had not applied it despite it being available for six months MyDoom  image copyright Getty Images This Windows email worm from January 2004 is believed to hold the current record for spreading fastest  hardly surprising given that it was reputedly created by professional spammers  It worked so well thanks to a clever bit of social engineering The email bearing the worm was designed to look like an error message This fiction was aided by the messages attachment which purported to hold a copy of the email that did not arrive  Opening the attachment kicked off the malicious code that resent the same message to everyone in a victims address book Conficker image copyright Getty Images November 2008 saw the arrival of this virulent worm which hit up to 15 million servers running Microsoft software It ran rampant and caught out hospitals governments the armed forces and many businesses  The outbreak was so bad that Microsoft offered a 250000 reward for any information leading to the identification of the worms creator Noone has ever been identified as its originator  A patch closing the loophole it exploited was released by Microsoft about a month after it appeared Even today 10 years on data traffic generated by machines infected with Conficker regularly turn up

president had looked at  before being talked out of it by his advisers By contrast Presidentelect Joe Biden has made it clear that he wants the US to rejoin the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran which would mean reversing sanctions and releasing money to Tehran in exchange for Irans full compliance So is Iran now safe from attack  image copyright AFP image caption Israels defence minister has said it needs to have a military option on the table In a word no Israel remains extremely concerned not just by Irans civilian nuclear activities but by its prolific programme to develop its arsenal of ballistic missiles  On Thursday Israels Defence Minister Benny Gantz was quoted as saying in reference to Irans nuclear development programme  It is clear that Israel needs to have a military option on the table  It requires resources and investment and I am working to make that happen Israel as the Islamic Republics declared enemy sees a nuclear bomb in Iranian hands as a threat to its very existence and has urged the world to stop it before it is too late  media caption In 2018 Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Irans secret atomic archive Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely peaceful but its recent action  to increase the enrichment of its uranium   one of a sequence which contravene the 2015 deal  has set alarm bells ringing  In 1981 Israel suspected that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was looking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability  In Operation Babylon it took preemptive action by carrying out a successful air raid using its own F15 and F16 jets destroying Iraqs Osirak nuclear reactor  Twentysix years later in 2007 it did the same to Syria in Operation Outside the Box destroying a secret plutonium reactor in the desert near Deir alZour just before it was activated Out of sight But Iran is a far harder target in terms of distance accessibility and air defences It is questionable whether Israel could carry out a successful air raid without US participation  something a Biden administration will be reluctant to do  image copyright Maxar Technologies via Getty Images image caption Satellite images appear to show recent tunnel construction south of Irans Natanz enrichment plant Conscious of the longstanding threat to its nuclear facilities  from the US Israel and possibly the Gulf Arab states  Iran has invested money and effort in burying some of them deep underground beneath its mountains  Irans nuclear industry while ostensibly civilian is closely entwined with its military and security infrastructure  In fact the Iranians have had so long to prepare for an attack that there is now a distinct possibility that their underground facilities are becoming impenetrable Despite this Irans nuclear facilities remain vulnerable to attack on three fronts Physical attack Irans facilities are not impregnable says Mark Fitzpatrick an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies IISS and an expert on arms control  The one at Natanz is vulnerable to precise bunkerbusting bombing maybe taking two precise hits one to dig a crater and the other to burst through it or at least to shake the delicate machines enough to put them out of commission But Iran is a vast country and its nuclear facilities are spread out in depth  As far back as 2012 experts suggested that the uranium enrichment facility at Fordo buried at least 80m 260ft inside a mountain might be impregnable to even the devastating explosive power of US bunkerbusting precisionguided bombs Fordos greater depth protects the facility against bunkerbusters but not against sabotage says Mark Fitzpatrick and it could be put out of commission for a period of months by blasting its entryways and airshafts image copyright GeoEye Satellite Image image caption Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20 purity at the underground Fordo facility earlier this month But to reach these facilities would require one possibly two waves of air strikes penetrating deep into Iranian airspace and either evading or overpowering its air defences  Iran has invested heavily in developing its surfacetoair missile force including the Bavar373  a homegrown version of Russias S300 system that is capable of tracking and shooting down aircraft up to 300km 186 miles away The prospect of an only partially successful strike with downed pilots captured and paraded on Iranian TV is a strong disincentive Human attack This has already been happening  Israels Mossad intelligence agency has managed to develop an extraordinarily wellinformed network of agents inside Iran  So wellinformed that when Irans top military scientist Brig Gen Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was travelling in a protected convoy on a lonely road east of Tehran on 27 November his attackers knew his precise route and timings  image copyright Reuters image caption Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was known as the godfather of Irans nuclear programme Reports differ on how he was attacked on that day Iran claims it was by a remote satellitecontrolled machine gun mounted on a pickup truck  Other sources believe it was by a sizable team of Mossadtrained agents who escaped and remain at large  Either way Fakhrizadeh  known as the godfather of Irans nuclear programme who US intelligence says carried out covert work on nuclear weapons  was assassinated  How will Iran respond to nuclear scientists killing What were the motives behind the killing After Trump what will Biden do about Iran What is behind mysterious fires at Iran sites Israel has not commented officially on who was behind it Before that between 2010 and 2012 four leading Iranian nuclear scientists were all assassinated inside Iran some by car bombs  Again Israel neither confirmed nor denied its involvement But the killings show that despite heavy protection by Iranian state security assassins are able to reach their targets setting back Irans intellectual capacity in nuclear technology Cyber attack There is an undeclared war going on in cyberspace with Iran on one side and the US Israel and Saudi Arabia ranged against it In 2010 a sophisticated piece of malware codenamed Stuxnet was secretly introduced into the computers controlling Irans uraniumenriching centrifuges at Natanz  The result was chaos causing the centrifuges to spin out of control and setting the enrichment programme back by years  image copyright Reuters image caption Iran said a fire at its Natanz nuclear facility in July 2020 was the result of sabotage The cyber attack was widely reported to have been Israeli although US and Israeli experts are believed to have collaborated on developing Stuxnet  Iran soon hit back successfully inserting its own sophisticated malware codenamed Shamoon into the network of Saudi Arabias stateowned oil company Saudi Aramco disabling 30000 computers and threatening Saudi Arabias oil production  Further attacks have followed Continual risk The 2015 nuclear deal  the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action  was supposed to place such stringent curbs on Irans nuclear activities that it would negate the need for its adversaries to consider a military strike image copyright EPA image caption Irans government insists the countrys nuclear programme is entirely peaceful But Israel and Saudi Arabia were always sceptical about the deal because they considered it too lenient and temporary and because it did nothing to address Irans ballistic missile programme  Today they are less than enthusiastic about a Biden presidency reviving the deal unless it addresses those concerns   Nobody in the Gulf region wants to see another conflict Even  the 2019 missile attack on Saudi Arabias oil infrastructure  widely blamed on Iran and its allies went unanswered  But as long as suspicions remain that Iran is secretly working on developing a nuclear warhead capability then the risk of a preemptive attack on its facilities will always be there

sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Like the Beebone malware XMens Mystique  played by Jennifer Lawrence  morphs to take on other identities Shapeshifting malware that changes its identity up to 19 times a day to avoid detection has been deactivated by Europes Cybercrime Centre and the FBI  At its height in September 2014 the malware called Beebone was controlling 100000 computers a day Criminals used it to help steal passwords and download other programs to the infected computers   Around 12000 victims are being asked to use new online cleanup tools to remove it    Mystiquelike morphing  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Beebone downloaded other malware which could steal passwords and banking details Once on a victims computer Beebone operates like a downloader application that can be controlled by the suspected criminal gangs behind the program  It was used to force victims PCs to fetch other malware from the internet including password stealers ransomware rootkits and programs designed to take down legitimate websites  Computer security firm Intel Security which helped law enforcement agencies to stop the malware said it had seen Beebone change its identity up to 19 times per day to avoid more traditional signature detection antivirus methods  Intel Securitys chief technology officer Raj Samani told the BBC Beebone is highly sophisticated It regularly changes its unique identifier downloading a new version of itself and can detect when it is being isolated studied or attacked  It can successfully block attempts to kill it    Operation Beebone Operation Beebone was carried out by the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce set up by the European Union to tackle crossborder internet crime The team finally managed to tackle the malware by stopping it from connecting to servers on the net used to control and send it instructions  Nearly 100 com net and org domains have been sinkholed  the process by which traffic meant for specific IP addresses is redirected from suspected criminalcontrolled sites to the investigating authorities This allows detectives to see how the application behaves and to intercept requests for further instructions by the malicious software   The FBI assisted in redirecting traffic from most of the sites being used by the gangs because they were operated from the United States and are under US jurisdiction  The operation also involved private security firms Intel Security Kaspersky Labs and Shadowserver The taskforce now believes it has isolated the morphing malware so criminals can no longer make use of it Sustained threat Head of operations at the European Cybercrime Centre Paul Gillen told the BBC the agency would now look at whether those behind the attacks could be identified and brought to justice He admitted the solution the taskforce had found was not a permanent one We cant sinkhole these domains forever We need those infected to clean up their computers as soon as possible Several security vendors have created a free tool to remove the Beebone malware including FSecure TrendMicro Symantec and Intel Security image copyright Europol image caption Symantec is one of several private security firms signed up to help EC3 But victims need to first realise they have the malware on their systems before they can download the removal tool  Raj Samani said those who have the malware will be notified by their internet service provider  ISPs in each affected country will be handed a list of suspected victims to contact by the taskforce   Dangerous threat The Beebone malware was described by the Europol taskforce as very sophisticated Some security experts believe the consequences of the attack could have been much worse    Portcullis Security in the UK advises various British government departments on cybersecurity issues Its director Paul Docherty told the BBC  The fact that it the malware is complicated suggests that it could be used for more targeted attacks If those responsible were able to harness similar difficulttodetect code they could potentially move the point of attack from home users to corporate users or other entities which typically hold large amounts of sensitive valuable data Mr Docherty said computer users should have antivirus software installed and that it was essential that they kept it uptodate He warned against members of the  public underestimating how valuable their computer might be to criminal hackers  There is still a general consensus that It wont happen to me I have nothing anyone could want However when you discuss with people what they actually use their technology for this changes very quickly  Future challenge The total number of computers infected by Beebone is relatively modest compared with some recent malware takedowns like GameOver Zeus Security experts believe this is because the malware was not spread by mass emailing potential victims with poisoned internet links an approach known as spearphishing Intel Security said Beebone  was more commonly spread through hardware like USB drives or data discs     Now remaining victims are being asked to clean up their computers as soon as possible  Mr Samani said it is likely those who have Beebone on their computers were likely to have a lot of other malware too because of the nature of Beebone as a malware downloader itself  But there is another good reason why victims will want to move on quickly says Mr Docherty Cleanup after infection could be complicated as this criminal campaign has used a constantly changing polymorphic dropper to implant malware it is possible that it has also installed code of a similar nature to reenable access to the systems following cleanup Related Topics Cybersecurity More on this

link About sharing media caption The BBCs John Sudworth explains how the malware affects Apple products Malware has bypassed Apples safety controls by taking advantage of a process used by employers to add apps to workers iPhones and iPads USbased Palo Alto Networks  said WireLurker appeared to have originated in China and was mostly infecting devices there The malware first targets Mac computers via a thirdparty store before copying itself to iOS devices Researchers warn it steals information and can install other damaging apps WireLurker is unlike anything weve ever seen in terms of Apple iOS and OS X malware said Ryan Olson Palo Alto Networks intelligence director  The techniques in use suggest that bad actors are getting more sophisticated when it comes to exploiting some of the worlds bestknown desktop and mobile platforms  WireLurker has the ability to transfer from Apples Mac computer to mobile devices through a USB cable  image copyright Getty Images image caption The malware initially gets onto an iOS device via a USB link to an infected Mac computer The security firm said the malware was capable of stealing a variety of information from mobile devices it infects and regularly requested updates from the attackers control server This malware is under active development and its creators ultimate goal is not yet clear the company added Apple has issued a brief statement We are aware of malicious software available from a download site aimed at users in China and weve blocked the identified apps to prevent them from launching it said As always we recommend that users download and install software from trusted sources Work apps According to Palo Alto Networks  WireLurker was first noticed in June  when a developer at the Chinese firm Tencent realised there were suspicious files and processes happening on his Mac and iPhone Further inquiries revealed a total of 467 Mac programs listed on the Maiyadi App Store had been compromised to include the malware which in turn had been downloaded 356104 times as of 16 Oct Infected software included popular games including Angry Birds The Sims 3 Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 and Battlefield Bad Company 2 Once the malware was on the Mac it communicated with a commandandcontrol server to check if it needed to update its code and then waited until an iPhone iPad or iPod was connected When an iOS device was connected the malware would check if it was jailbroken  a process used by some to remove some of Apples restrictions If it was jailbroken WireLurker backed up the devices apps to the Mac where it repackaged them with malware and then installed the infected versions back on to the iOS machine If it was not jailbroken  which is the case for most iOS devices  WireLurker took advantage of a technique created by Apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staffs handsets and tablets  image copyright PAlo alto networks image caption Wirelurker hides its code inside software that is initially downloaded to a Mac computer This involved placing infected apps on the device that had been signed with a bogus enterprise certificate  code added to a product that is supposed to prove it comes from a trustworthy source  To ensure the devices accepted this certificate a permissions request was made to pop up on the targeted iOS device on the users first attempt to run an infected app  It simply asked for permission to run the app but if the user clicked continue it installed code called a provisioning profile which told the iOS device it could trust any other app that had the same enterprise certificate Palo Alto Networks remarked that while this technique was not a new concept it was the only known example of it being used to target nonjailbroken iOS devices in the wild Once active the malware is used to upload information about the machine to the hackers including phone numbers from its Contacts app and the users Apple ID Different versions of WireLurker also automatically installed new apps on the devices  including a video game and a comic book reader image copyright palo alto networks image caption The hackers fooled users into approving a bogus enterprise certificate While these were innocuous experts warn they could represent a test run for other more damaging software People have got very used to iOS being secure and there is a danger they may be complacent about the risk this presents said Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey Now Apple knows what its looking for it should be able to shut it down relatively easily But it shows that people are trying to attack Apples operating system and the firm cant take security for granted  Under attack News of the attack comes after tech giant Apples iCloud storage service in China was attacked by hackers trying to steal user information just last month Chinese web monitoring group Greatfireorg said that hackers intercepted data and potentially gained access to passwords messages photos and contacts They believed the Beijing government was behind the move But the Chinese government denied the claims and was backed by stateowned internet provider China Telecom which said the accusation was untrue and unfounded China is home to the worlds biggest smartphone market and Apple saw its iPhone sales there jump 50 in the April to June quarter from a year earlier To minimise the risk of attack Palo Alto Networks has recommended that users Do not download Mac apps from thirdparty stores Do not jailbreak iOS devices Do not connect their iOS devices to untrusted computers and accessories either to copy information or charge the machines Do not accept requests for a new enterprise provisioning profile unless it comes from an authorised party for

malicious code added to a number of apps commonly used on iPhones and iPads in China It is thought to be the first largescale attack on Apples App Store The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apples software for building iOS apps which they persuaded developers to download  Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks  which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost  said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into

malware found on iOS apps compared to Googles Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a Wild West for apps until they introduced their own malwarescanning system too It makes this attack all the more surprising as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out  Firstly developers who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit

several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers image copyright Palo Alto Networks image caption Links to the infected version of Xcode showed up in search engines In China  and in other places around the world  sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apples servers explained Palo Alto Networks in a followup blog As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected Apple does have a security tool  called Gatekeeper  that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run However it appears the developers must disabled the facility allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost Sense of security Despite the many news headlines about the breach one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products image copyright INTSIG

View original tweet on Twitter It is unclear what information has been stolen or exposed in the hack but the attackers have been monitoring networks since March and were active as recently as Sunday  the Washington Post reports  The attacks were first revealed  by Reuters  identifying breaches at the Treasury and homeland security the department which manages cybersecurity for the US government Parts of the defence department were also breached  the New York Times reports  while the Washington Post says that the state department and National Institutes of Health were hacked The UKs intelligence agency GCHQ is currently monitoring the situation and has described the compromises as serious events A number of UK government departments and other organisations use SolarWinds but its unclear if they use Orion The list of identified victims is expected to grow as more information about the incident emerges media caption Obamas former director of cyber security warns Radio 4s Today Russia election hacking is like playbook What happened SolarWinds Orions software allows IT staff to remotely access computers on corporate networks In a socalled supplychain attack hackers gained access to SolarWinds Orion and then had access to all of its customers networks FireEye a company that provides US government cybersecurity identified the largescale campaign after  it fell victim to the hackers in a separate attack  The actors manipulated SolarWinds Orions software updates to include malware which once installed allowed the hackers to monitor its customers systems Fireye said We have been advised this attack was likely conducted by an outside nation state and intended to be a narrow extremely targeted and manually executed attack as opposed to a broad systemwide attack SolarWinds said in a statement on its website It urged all users of its Orion platform to update their software immediately for security FireEye hack FireEyes own hacking tools which are used to carry out fake attacks on its customers were stolen by the same actors it said By mimicking the behaviour of hackers it uses these programmes to investigate the security of different organisations and offer advice on how to protect vulnerabilities Since the discovery there is evidence that these tools have already been used in 19 countries including the US UK and Ireland Raj Samani chief scientist at

When the experts investigating a cyberattack downgrade their estimate of the number of people affected its normally a good thing So when SolarWinds says the number of organisations that could have been spied upon through its products is not the 300000 initially feared youd think it would be cause for slight consolation Unfortunately this is almost completely irrelevant Like all cyberattacks its not about the quantity of victims but their quality You dont get much higher quality targets than US government departments The other key number in this hack is eight Thats how many months its thought the hackers had access to SolarWinds and could have started to snoop poke around or steal sensitive material from their customers The thing we dont know and may never know is what the quality of the information stolen is Its unlikely that toplevel government communications would have been breached  those are likely to be heavily encrypted and sent on separate systems But like any offices sometimes important operational documents snippets of information or even the digital keys to other parts of a business are left lying around in places they shouldnt be The investigation into this hack will be months long and its consequences could take years to be realised Related Topics Cybersecurity Cyberattacks Computer hacking More on this story US treasury and commerce departments hacked

network is used by people and website administrators wishing to conceal their identities A service accused of helping distribute child abuse images on a hidden part of the internet has been compromised Sites using service provider Freedom Hosting to deliver their material have had code added to their pages which could be used to reveal the identities of people visiting them Freedom Hosting delivered sites via Tor a network designed to keep net activity anonymous The news has led some to claim that Tor no longer offers a safe option This challenges the assumption people have made that Tor is a simple way of maintaining your anonymity online Alan Woodward chief technology officer at security advisors Charteris told the BBC The bottom line is that is not guaranteed even if you think you are taking the right steps to hide your identity This is the first time weve seen somebody looking to unmask people rather than just security researchers discussing the possibility Mr Woodward added that the way the added code had been designed suggested a US law enforcement agency was behind the breach Tor users expressed mixed feelings about the news This exploit targets kiddie porn viewers only If thats not you you have nothing to worry about  suggested one  An exploit refers to software that makes programs websites and other code do something they were not originally designed to do But another said This week its child porn next week it may be a whistleblower or an activist Malware attack News of the action was confirmed by an administrator of the Tor Project on its blog  It said that over the weekend people had contacted it to say that a large number of sites using Tor which were hidden from other net users had gone offline simultaneously The current news indicates that someone has exploited the software behind Freedom Hosting  it said  From what is known so far the breach was used to configure the server in a way that it injects some sort of Javascript exploit in the web pages delivered to users This exploit is used to load a malware payload to infect users computers Freedom Hosting was previously targeted by the Anonymous hacktivist collective whose members  temporarily forced it offline  in 2011 after claiming it was the largest host of material showing child abuse on Tor The Daily Dot news site reports that paedophiles continued to use the hosting service and have been warning each other of the breach since the news emerged They also told each other to stop using TorMail a service used to allow people to send and receive email anonymously which used Freedom Hostings servers Freedom Hosting also provided access to HackBB a hackingthemed discussion forum and the Cleaned Hidden Wiki an encyclopaedia of Tor and other dark nets The hosting services terms and conditions had stated that illegal activities were not allowed on the sites it supported but added that it was not responsible for its users actions Tors developers have stressed that the person or persons who run Freedom Hosting are in no way affiliated or connected to The Tor Project Law enforcers Analysis of the Javascript exploit suggests that it takes advantage of a vulnerability in Firefox 17 which meant that people using that version of Mozillas browser could be identified despite the protections built into Tor It appears to connect the machine using the compromised browser to an address which appears to originate from Reston Virginia US and sends the hostname and MAC media access control address of the machine Mr Woodward said Unlike IP internet protocol addresses media access control addresses are considered unique to a particular piece of hardware although they can be spoofed under certain circumstances It seems unlikely that the malware was written by criminals as the information it is sending back to its masters is of little use to anyone other than law enforcement agencies who are trying to track down machines that are using the Tor network to remain anonymous Irish arrest News of the breach came shortly after  the Irish Times reported  that a 28yearold Dublinbased man had been arrested and accused by the FBI of being the largest facilitator of child porn on the planet It said that Eric Eoin Marques faces allegations that he had aided and abetted a conspiracy to advertise material showing the abuse of prepubescent children The paper reported that the US authorities are seeking his extradition on four charges  It said the judge in the case ruled that while Mr Marques was entitled to the presumption of innocence he should remain in custody pending a further hearing because he posed a flight risk A spokesman for the FBI told the BBC An individual has been arrested in Ireland as part of an ongoing criminal investigation in the United States Because this is matter is ongoing longstanding Department of Justice Policy prohibits us from discussing this matter further More on this story Servers

link About sharing media caption Technology explained what is ransomware Ransomware is the fastest growing form of computer malware experts warn Its a malicious virus that locks the user out of their computer and demands a fee to return their files A report published by the Australian government  claims 72 of businesses surveyed experienced ransomware incidents in 2015 The figure was just 17 in 2013  Its also a growing threat for mobile devices as it can be hidden in an app says GertJan Schenk vicepresident at internet security company Lookout For the most part weve seen ransomware delivered through driveby downloads  it pretends to be a popular app increasing the chances that youll click on it he explains To avoid these threats users should be very careful about what apps they install and where they come from  read the reviews on Google Play and avoid sideloading from untrusted sources How does it work image copyright Thinkstock image caption The ransom is usually demanded in the form of bitcoins Like most computer viruses ransomware often arrives in the form of a phishing email or spam or a fake software update  and the recipient clicks a link or opens an attachment The virus then sets to work encrypting the users files Once the computer is effectively locked down it demands a fee  often in bitcoins because it is less easy to trace  for the return of the files The fee is generally one or two bitcoins  the equivalent of about 500 Â£330 It is less common now but in the earlier days of the malware  about five years ago  the ransom note could take the form of a law enforcement notice The user was directed to a web page that appeared to be from for example the FBI falsely claiming illegal images of children had been been found on the machine and a fine was payable There is generally a time limit to comply after which the ransom increases Is there any way to get round it image copyright Thinkstock image caption Back up back up back up Sometimes it is just a threat but mostly the virus really does encrypt files The only way to retrieve your files without paying the ransom is to go to a backedup version Neil Douglas from Edinburghbased IT company Network Roi has just helped a small business client whose server was hit by ransomware We had to recover everything from backup Wed had a backup two minutes before the infection so the timing couldnt have been any better  but it did result in quite a bit of downtime he says You could risk paying them  but its a bit like paying  a blackmailer We would only recommend it as a last resort You dont know whether theyll come back for more you dont know that theyll clear the infection Cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward says paying also leaves you vulnerable to further cybercrime As soon as you pay up you get on a suckers list and youll probably get contacted again he says Its lowhanging fruit for the criminals Do many people pay image copyright Thinkstock image caption The official advice is not to pay  but many do While all the expert advice is of course not to pay plenty of people do  even those you would least expect to Tewksbury Police in the US admitted they had paid up when their main server had been attacked and locked down at the end of last year Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists Nobody wants to pay terrorists Police Chief Timothy Sheehan  told the towns local paper  We did everything we possibly could It was an eyeopening experience I can tell you right now It made you feel that you lost control of everything Paying the bitcoin ransom was the last resort Ransomware is lucrative for criminals because so many victims pay rather than face the shame of false accusations  or like the police department they just desperately need their files Some companies have set up bitcoin accounts in case it happens to them says Prof Woodward I would recommend that nobody ever pays up The only way to deal with it is to be sure you have a virus checker and back up Who is behind it image copyright Thinkstock image caption Organised crime gangs use computer viruses to generate money It tends to be organised crime says Prof Woodward They do make millions out of it Its opportunistic they just try it on everybody You keep third parties out of it  the bank isnt involved Recent research by Palo Alto Networks and industry partners suggested one family of ransomware known as Crypto Wall had generated about 325m Â£215m for the gang behind it  In the volume cybercrime space ransomware is one of the most prolific problems we face Greg Day chief security officer for Europe at Palo Alto Networks told the BBC last month Credit card theft is getting to the point where the value of each card is very low  As a result ransomware has stepped into that gap and gives a

Copy link About sharing The man behind the worlds first major computer virus outbreak has admitted his guilt 20 years after his software infected millions of machines worldwide Filipino Onel de Guzman now 44 says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying He claims he never intended it to spread globally And he says he regrets the damage his code caused I didnt expect it would get to the US and Europe I was surprised he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com a forthcoming book on cybercrime The Love Bug pandemic began on 4 May 2000  Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVELETTERFORYOU It contained malicious code that would overwrite files steal passwords and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victims Microsoft Outlook address book Within 24 hours it was causing major problems across the globe reportedly infecting 45 million machines It also overwhelmed organisations email systems and some IT managers disconnected parts of their infrastructure to prevent infection  This led to estimates of damage and disruption running into billions of pounds In the UK Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to protect itself and even the Pentagon was reportedly affected The previous year the Melissa bug is believed to have infected a million machines using similar tactics However Love Bug dwarfed previous outbreaks and exposed how vulnerable the worlds increasing internet connectivity was to attack Investigators traced the virus to an email address registered to an apartment in Manila capital of the Philippines The occupants brother was Onel de Guzman a computer science student at the citys AMA Computer College He was a member of an underground hacking group called Grammersoft and quickly became the lead suspect in a police investigation De Guzmans lawyer organised a press conference on 11 May at which de Guzman appeared to speak little English  When asked whether he may have released the virus accidentally de Guzman said It is possible At the time the Philippines had no law covering computer hacking and neither de Guzman nor anyone else was ever prosecuted  Suspicion also fell on de Guzmans fellow student Michael Buen who has been cited online as the coauthor of the Love Bug I set out to track down Onel de Guzman and resolve the 20year mystery of Love Bugs origin Online rumours claimed de Guzman had moved to Germany Austria or the US Some claimed he had been recruited by Microsoft following the outbreak All proved to be wide of the mark On a forum dedicated to the Philippine underworld a user claimed in 2016 that de Guzman ran a mobile phone repair shop in the Quiapo district of Manila In April 2019 I visited the area hoping to encounter the suspect only to find a sprawling market containing dozens of mobile phone repair shops I wrote Onel de Guzmans name on a piece of paper and showed it to shop workers at random in the hope that someone would recognise it Finally an employee said he knew of de Guzman and believed he now worked in another phone repair booth at a shopping mall elsewhere in Manila After several hours wandering around the mall and showing de Guzmans name I was directed to a cramped messy stall at the very back of the building and after waiting several hours for him to turn up Onel de Guzman arrived He admitted having created Love Bug which he said was a revamped version of an earlier virus he had coded in order to steal internet access passwords  In the era of dialup internet such passwords were needed to get online and de Guzman says he could not afford to pay for one He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims with whom he communicated in chat rooms because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area However in spring 2000 he tweaked the code adding an autospreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims Outlook contacts using a flaw in Microsofts Windows 95 operating system He also created a title for the email attachment that would have global appeal tempting people across the world to open it I figured out that many people want a boyfriend they want each other they want love so I called it that he said image caption Onel de Guzman says he regrets the damage his creation caused De Guzman claims he sent the virus initially to someone in Singapore and then went out drinking with a friend The first he knew of the global chaos he had unleashed was when his mother told him police were hunting a hacker in Manila He explained that his mother hid his computer equipment De Guzman insists Buen had nothing to do with Love Bug and that he was its sole creator After a period of lying low de Guzman returned to computer work but did not go back to college He now runs the small booth with another member of staff He says he regrets writing the virus and the infamy it has brought him Sometimes I get my picture on the internet he said  My friends say Its you Im a shy person I dont want this Related Topics Cybercrime Cybersecurity Manila More on this story Love Bug bites UK

About sharing image copyright Ken Main image caption The message Ken Main received on his company computer demanding a ransom for the release of his data Something wasnt right about the phone screen It had gone dark Thats when Nick Harvey examined it more closely It looked odd And it was then that he saw the message His smart phone had in effect been hijacked and he was being asked to pay a ransom My device had been locked he told BBC Radio 4s PM Programme  He was being instructed to send some money via a voucher code to get the phone unlocked Ken Main knows how Nick felt It happened to him with the computers at his hairdressing salon in Glasgow It was a pale blue screen with the message right in the middle he explained If we wanted the information back we would have to pay a ransom Cash call They had both become victims of what is known as ransomware  a type of computer virus which unlocks the users out of their computers or phones and demands money for the return of the files media caption American police paid a ransom to hackers who encrypted the departments data Its like somebody breaking into your house Ken said It was a message which kind of created the same sort of emotional fear and then you start thinking God what happens if I cant get this information back You are probably now trying to guess how much Ken and Nick were being asked to pay It is possibly quite a lot lower than you would think They asked me for 50 or â¬50 Nick recalled For Ken it was slightly more They were looking for a ransom of 350 initially he said When we contacted them by email they put that up to â¬1000 The demands are set at what is regarded as a payable level according to Jornt van der Wiel from the security software company Kaspersky Lab image copyright Google image caption Ken Mains hairdressing business They tend to be for the amount of money that people are still willing to pay in order to get their files back  He explained for a small business Sometimes its cheaper for the company just to pay the ransom than to put back the backup because that in the end costs more Police files Nick Harvey did not have to part with any money He managed to get his phone working again although he did lose some data Ken however felt he had no choice but to pay up  I said Well I need that bloody information back Ive got a business to run here I think any businessman in my position would say Yes Lets do it because Ive got no other way of getting information to rebuild that database According to Mr van der Wiel ransomware can enter your computer via malicious email attachments His advice is not to open any file which you are suspicious about He says there can also be a problem if the latest security patches on your internet browser have not been installed media caption Technology explained what is ransomware Such are the difficulties that a ransomware attack can create even those responsible for enforcing the law have given into the criminals When the systems at the police department in Tewksbury Massachusetts were affected computer experts tried everything but to no avail We couldnt restore it from an external backup Chief Timothy Sheehan said because that was also corrupted and the taped backup we had was at least 18 months old We realised we were in a perfect storm We were in a very bad situation The police department paid the ransom via a third party Ultimately we decided that in our particular situation we should take the shot of paying the 500 dollars in bitcoin and see if we got the decryption key returned to us and we could return all of the data that was encrypted back to its normal status image copyright Reuters image caption Many ransomware gangs demand payment in bitcoins Chief Sheehan conceded that it meant paying money to criminals and he now wants to highlight the threat ransomware poses Data loss According to Raj Samani Intel Securitys chief technology officer in Europe the Middle East and Africa those behind ransomware are making hundreds of millions of dollars He said there has been enormous growth in ransomware certainly over the last 12 months  He believes people in the UK are particularly vulnerable There are many different types of ransomware viruses but according to Mr Samani in almost every single type we look at the UK is either second or third on that list so I would argue that the UK is targeted disproportionately  with regards to the number of internet users that we have Security experts have found ways of unlocking some forms of ransomware but those behind the cyber criminals are developing more sophisticated viruses too  Back in the hairdressers in Glasgow Ken Main has no regrets about paying the ransom However it didnt solve all his problems Do not think paying up means all will end well I would say 80 to 90 of the information was corrupted he said In terms of hard cash income I would say we were probably down by about Â£20000 Related Topics Cybersecurity

Copy link About sharing image copyright Daragh Mc SweeneyProvision image caption Marcin first started writing antivirus software when he was 14 The BBCs weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world This week we speak to Marcin Kleczynski chief executive and cofounder of US antivirus software company Malwarebytes A lot of entrepreneurs have a moment A moment that makes them realise theyre on to something  For Marcin Kleczynski it came while he was discreetly working on his antivirus software business from his student digs His startup company Malwarebytes was less than a year old back in late 2008 but already gaining a good reputation in the cyber security world Marcin then only 18 was just about managing to juggle running his startup with participating in student life at the University of Illinois when he hit a snag I was having some real trouble analysing the latest computer virus when all of a sudden I get a white page on my screen that says youve been banned from the school network due to malicious activity on your desktop he says image copyright Marcin Kleczynski  image caption Marcin left pictured here during a game of broomball while he was a student did have some fun at university Theyd obviously detected that I had a virus on my computer but didnt realise it was deliberate So I call the university IT helpline and they send a kid no older than me He sits down at my computer and looks at it and says boy youve really screwed this thing up Then right in front of me he logs onto my website and downloads Malwarebytes I didnt say anything I stood behind him and watched him fix my computer with my software to get me back online He left never knowing who I was but to this day I love that moment By the time Marcin graduated with a degree in computer science in 2012 he had quietly grown Malwarebytes into a business earning a few million dollars a year All without any of his lecturers having any idea what was taking up his time and pushing his grades down Today the company has an annual turnover of more than 126m and millions of customers around the world Born in Poland in 1989 Marcin moved to the US with his family when he was three settling in Chicago As a gamingobsessed teenager hed accidentally got a virus when he was 14 and learned everything he needed to know about computer bugs from internet forums and a For Dummies book image copyright Malwarebytes image caption The company now has more than 750 employees Formally launching Malwarebytes in January 2008 when he was just 18 it grew quickly and he decided that starting university in September of that year would just slow him down His mother had other thoughts The business was becoming real and so I went sheepishly to my mum and said I dont think Im going to go to school says Marcin Fifteen seconds later we were packing my stuff and I was going to school What made Mrs Kleczynski initially more alarmed was that her teenage son had launched the business with a man in his 30s called Bruce Harrison Marcin and Bruce had been writing software together for more than a year after they first started talking on antivirus forums Heres this 17yearold kid hes this 35yearold man Imagine telling your mum says Marcin More  The Boss  features Three months after I was paralysed I was back at work I got wiped out but I was determined to make it back How rude service inspired a multimillion euro firm Bulletproof coffee Would you add butter to your brew Marcin and Bruce hadnt actually met in person at the time Bruce was a computer repairman in Massachusetts and Marcin was at home in Chicago They didnt in fact see each other in the flesh until Malwarebytes was more than 12 months old We didnt meet until we made our first million about a year after we launched the product says Marcin Even that was kind of anticlimatic It was just Hey Bruce  We had a handshake and moved on  Today Bruce who is head of research still lives and works on the US east coast while Marcin is based in the head office in Silicon Valley The company now has more than 750 employees and overseas offices in the Republic of Ireland Singapore and Estonia Since 2014 it has secured 80m of investment funding image copyright Marcin Kleczynski  image caption Marcin is a qualified pilot who likes to fly in his spare time Malwarebytes says its software now performs 187 million virus scans every month for individuals and businesses and is installed more than 247000 times every day Like many antivirus companies it operates a freemium business model  the basic version is free but you can then pay for more advanced protection While the company has consistently grown strongly Marcin has learned some hard lessons along the way The most difficult time was navigating the business through an almost catastrophic period in 2014 where the product glitched on a huge scale We had a false positive which means we detected a piece of malicious software that wasnt actually malicious at all he says Our software ended up mistakenly bringing down hundreds of thousands of computers We had 911 emergency centres go down hospitals go down it was bad This has happened to every antivirus company by the way but these mistakes can be company killing because you lose trust  But we fixed it and got through it Even today the system that we created to prevent this from happening again is called The Malwarebytes Extinction Prevention System  our engineers have a great sense of humour  image copyright Marcin Kleczynski  image caption He met his future wife while at university Carl Gottlieb a cyber security podcaster says that despite operating in the notoriously hostile antivirus industry Malwarebytes is thriving With so many competing vendors brand awareness is key and that step which Malwarebytes took to offer a free product years ago is paying dividends with so many customers knowing the name and already using it in their homes What Marcin and his team have achieved is impressive to see Still only 29 Marcin says his young age has been an advantage He encourages other budding teen entrepreneurs to start their own business Youve heard my story I started the company when I was living with my parents he says And then even at college it was all paid for on a student loan so I was getting fed If youre in college now instead of going out and getting drunk with your friends maybe take one night a week just to see if theres anything you want to work on personally He admits that his university years were harder than his friends that he barely passed his degree and his social life no doubt suffered However hes glad his mum forced him to go For one thing I met my wife there he says Related Topics Entrepreneurship Cybersecurity

Proofpoint echoed MalwareTechs view I highly suspect that with the amount of coverage that this incident is getting there are probably already people that are working to incorporate the exploit that was used for spreading he said He said his research experience on targeted attacks made him doubt a nation state was involved here  This attack was so simple and unsophisticated that leads me to believe the people or person involved even though they are quite capable theyre more along the lines of an amateur he said Investigators are working to track down those responsible for the ransomware

in Microsoft Windows software first identified by the US National Security Agency experts have said  Europol described the cyberattack as  unprecedented  and said its cybercrime team was working with affected countries to mitigate the threat and assist victims Oliver Gower of the UKs National Crime Agency added Cyber criminals may believe they are anonymous but we will use all the tools at our disposal to bring them to justice Update not applied In the UK critics said the government had known about the threat of a cyberattack for some time but hospitals had not made the right upgrades to protect themselves  A security update  or patch  was released by Microsoft in March to protect against the virus but it appears many NHS organisations had not applied it or were using an older version of the operating system no longer supported  namely Windows XP NHS Digital said that 47 of devices within the NHS use Windows XP with the figure continuing to decrease media caption Home Secretary

About sharing image copyright Reuters image caption TalkTalk has warned its customers to be on the alert for scammers TalkTalk customers are being targeted by an industrialscale fraud network in India according to whistleblowers who say they were among hundreds of staff hired to scam customers of the British telecoms giant The scale of the criminal operation has been detailed by the three sources who say they were employed by two frontcompanies set up by a gang of professional fraudsters The sources describe working in call centres in two Indian cities  They say as many as 60 employees work in shifts in each office phoning TalkTalk customers and duping them into giving access to their bank accounts The whistleblowers say they were given a script in which they were told to claim they were calling from TalkTalk  They say they then convinced victims to install a computer virus  A separate team would use that virus to gain access to victims online banking they add While it has not been possible to independently verify their claims the sources have given highly detailed accounts of the scammers tactics which correlate very closely with previous reports of fraud targeting TalkTalk customers The software they named also  matches that identified by TalkTalk  in its own website guidance on what to watch out for in a scam call In addition a victim of the fraud shown the call centre script has confirmed it matched the one read out to her when she was conned out of Â£5000 image caption One of the whistleblowers shared this screenshot of one of the scripts TalkTalk was hit by a cyberattack in October 2015 but that hack appears to be unrelated to the Indian fraud Instead it is alleged the scam is linked to problems in a company hired by the British broadband provider In 2011 TalkTalk outsourced some of its callcentre work to the Kolkata Calcutta office of Wipro one of Indias largest IT service companies  Last year three Wipro employees were arrested on  suspicion of selling TalkTalk customer data  A source in Kolkata who did not want to be named alleges the same data was obtained by a criminal gang with USB sticks full of data trading hands at parties The criminals then used the data to operate at least three call centres according to the whistleblowers where staff work in shifts earning about Â£120 per month to perpetrate an intricate but highly successful scam They say they phone TalkTalk customers using the stolen data to convince victims they are genuine employees of the company  They then convince the victims their computers are infected and offer to fix the problems  Through this the whistleblowers say the victim is tricked into installing a virus that gives the scammer complete control over their machine image caption The leaked scripts indicate workers were told how to fool victims into believing them The victims are then offered a compensation payment for which they must log in to online banking they add  Thanks to the virus the fraudsters are able to gain access to the victims bank accounts when they log in  They say they use various methods to spirit away the money in some cases pretending to make erroneous overpayments then convincing victims to repay the extra amount In other cases victims have said the scammers were able to set up a new payee without their knowledge and transfer the money out of the account directly Why the whistleblowers appear credible Although the BBC cannot be sure of the whistleblowers claims the following suggested they were telling the truth the three whistleblowers approached us seemingly independently of each other the information they shared  including the scripts they were told to read out  correlated to a high degree during extensive online conversations they revealed indepth knowledge of the scammers techniques much of which is not in the public domain and matches the experience of TalkTalk fraud victims one of the whistleblowers shared a copy of his drivers licence confirming his identity the whistleblowers said they were ignorant of the full scale of the fraud because the eventual bank account theft was handled by a separate smaller team in a different office at one stage two of the whistleblowers attempted to share the information of UK victims they had called and asked us to warn the victims before they fell for the scam Dozens of customers are said to have been affected and many have lost thousands of pounds as a result of the fraud  Leigh Day solicitors is representing about 20 people who have between them lost almost Â£100000 image caption The scripts suggest TalkTalk customers were told that inaction would cause their computers to stop working Questions remain about the speed with which TalkTalk responded to the data breach at Wipro which is believed to have been in late 2014  It was only in October 2015 after the apparently unrelated cyberattack that TalkTalk began a forensic review leading to the arrests at Wipro We are aware that there are criminals targeting a number of UK and international companies and we take our responsibility to protect our customers very seriously said a spokeswoman for TalkTalk This is why we launched our Beat The Scammers campaign helping all our customers to keep themselves from safe from scammers no matter who they claim to be while our network also proactively blocks over 90 million scam and nuisance calls a month Wipro did not respond to requests for comment When contacted the two companies named by the whistleblowers strongly denied any knowledge of criminal behaviour and insisted their businesses were legitimate Geoff White is a freelance investigative journalist  who has also reported for Channel 4 News More on this story TalkTalks hack advice is

close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Current testing and contact tracing is inadequate to prevent a second wave of coronavirus after schools in the UK reopen scientists have warned Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children they say Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important  but more work was needed to keep the virus in check The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was already delivering and on the right track for future  Baroness Dido Harding said I absolutely dont accept that this is failure its the opposite She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was well within the bounds of what the researchers are saying is necessary  The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems Asked about the estimate that only 50 of contacts are being traced in England Simon Clarke minister for regional growth told the BBC government figures were higher He said NHS test and trace is maturing all the time and getting children back to school in the autumn is a top priority that the government would not be willing to trade Youre building an entirely new infrastructure which theres no precedent for he said But were confident it is working were confident that it will continue to improve and were confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn Very bad surges Dr David Nabarro the World Health Organizations special envoy on Covid19 said the virus is capable of surging back really quickly and stressed the importance of being able to trace test and isolate people If we can do that and do it well then the surges are kept really small theyre dealt with quickly and life can go on he told BBC Radio 4s Today programme He later said he thinks Britain will do really well because there is really good attention to where the virus is locally and a lot of public engagement in getting on top of it A government spokesman said local authorities will be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases LOCKDOWN LIMIT  Can we lift lockdown any further SCHOOLS  When will children be returning EXERCISE  What are the guidelines on getting out THE R NUMBER  What it means and why it matters LOOKUP TOOL  How many cases in your area Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities The study assumes children  are less likely to catch   and therefore spread  coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home  As first reported in June  the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective testandtrace programme  This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown The study  now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health  shows a second wave could be prevented if both 75 of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68 of their contacts traced or both 87 of people with symptoms were found and 40 of their contacts traced Doesnt look good enough However the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short  They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested they say this also appears too low  It is not achieving the levels we have modelled It doesnt look good enough to me said Prof Chris Bonell from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine Dr Jasmina PanovskaGriffiths from UCL added With UK schools reopening fully in September prevention of a second wave will require a major scaleup of testing to test 75 of symptomatic infections  combined with tracing of 68 of their contacts and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases How testandtrace works People with symptoms of cough fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend

come in Youve got to sympathise with the nurses as they will have to work extra hours It was unbelievable you dont expect to go to hospital in the middle of a cyberattack Damn nuisance The virus identified as WannaCry exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software first identified by the US National Security Agency experts have said Kingsley Manning a former chairman of NHS Digital said the government and the NHS had been very well aware that a cyberattack was a threat and significant amounts of money had been invested in anticipation that this sort of thing would happen Cybersecurity responsibility After the home secretary expressed disappointment that some health trusts were still operating computer systems on Windows XP despite having been advised to upgrade Mr Manning claimed that several hundred thousand computers were still running Windows XP He added that the government would have been aware of that Mr Manning told BBC Radio 4s PM programme Some trusts took the advice that was offered to them very seriously and acted on it and some of them may not have done If youre sitting in a hardpressed hospital in the middle of England it is difficult to see that as a greater priority than dealing with outpatients or AE Its very difficult to get individual trusts to use the money for this purpose NHS Digital said that 47 of devices within the NHS use Windows XP with the figure continuing to decrease How did the attack work media caption Experts discuss the attack The most terrifying thing about this is how simple it is The ransomware used in the attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems It encrypts files on a users computer blocking them from view before demanding money via an onscreen message to access them again  The malware seems to have spread via a computer virus known as a worm Unlike many other malicious programs this one has the ability to move around a network by itself Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code Some experts say the attackers used a weakness in Microsoft systems which is known to the US National Security Agency as EternalBlue A cybersecurity researcher tweeting as malwaretechblog has claimed to have found a way to slow down the spread of the virus after registering a domain name hidden in the malware He said that the malware makes a request to a domain name but if it is live the malware stops spreading A security update  or patch  was released by Microsoft in March to protect against the virus but it appears many organisations have not applied the patch  or may still be using outdated systems like Windows XP Get news from the BBC in your inbox each weekday morning Related Topics NHS

image copyright Thinkstock image caption Cybercrime and fraud were included in the annual statistics for the first time There were an estimated 36 million cases of fraud and two million computer misuse offences in a year according to an official survey  The Crime Survey for England and Wales included the offences for the first time in its annual report which covered the year to September Separate figures recorded by police showed an 8 rise in offences overall  The Office for National Statistics said crime recording improvements meant the police figures could not reveal trends Crime has changed John Flatley from the ONS said In the past burglary and theft of vehicles were the highvolume crimes driving trends but their numbers have fallen substantially since then When the crime survey started 35 years ago fraud was not considered a significant threat and the internet had yet to be invented Todays figures demonstrate how crime has changed with fraud now the most commonly experienced offence Sir Tom Winsor the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales told the You and Yours programme on BBC Radio 4 that many frauds went undetected and a great deal never got reported to the police The amount of fraud that is taking place now is probably in epidemic proportions he added The police are having to work very very hard to keep up with even the ones they know about The capability at police forces is quite skeletal and that needs to change and change a great deal  The National Police Chiefs Council lead for crime and incident recording Chief Constable Jeff Farrar said forces were working with the Home Office police and crime commissioners and industry experts to develop new tactics to fight cybercrime  The ability to commit crime online demonstrates the need for policing to adapt and transform to tackle these cyber challenges he said  Cyber and fraud What is being counted  image copyright PA Bank and credit account fraud  meaning criminals accessing bank accounts credit cards or fraudulently using plastic card details Advance fee fraud  crimes where the victim has been tricked into handing over cash after a communication such as a lottery scam  Noninvestment fraud  criminals conning a victim into buying something often online perhaps through a bogus phone call or email Other frauds including investment or fake charity scams There are two broad categories of computer misuse crimes  Unauthorised access to personal information including hacking Computer virus malware or other incidents such as DDoS attacks aimed at online services  Des Dillon who runs a student accommodation company told BBC Radio 5 live he had become a victim of cybercrime after being tricked into giving away information that led to the loss of Â£230000 from his company bank account  Over a couple of phone calls he asked me for various information third number fourth number and ninth letter that type of thing and obviously he put it together very quickly he said  Weve recouped over Â£100000 were outstanding Â£113000 We managed to block and recoup the balance and now were fighting with the bank about the other portion of it Katy Worobec director of Financial Fraud Action UK said banks had managed to stop Â£6 in every Â£10 targeted by criminals in the first half of 2016 but that people needed to be aware of the threat  While the industry invests in new systems to stop the criminals fraudsters are increasingly targeting people directly she said  Customers and businesses need to be alert to the threats posed by the continued rise in impersonation scams attempting to trick them out of their personal details and money Homicide rise All but one police force  Nottinghamshire  recorded an increase in violent crime last year The largest percentage increases were logged by Northumbria Police up 95 Durham Police 73 West Yorkshire Police 48 and Avon and Somerset Police 45 Violence against a person offences now include revenge pornography and internet trolling which the ONS believes contributed towards the 22 rise from last year   Police recorded 695 homicides in the 12 months to the end of September  125 more than the previous year This included the 96 cases of manslaughter resulting from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster because the inquest verdicts were returned during the last recording period Excluding those deaths there was still a 5 rise in homicides  Criminals looking for new opportunities By Dominic Casciani BBC home affairs correspondent image copyright PA The figures for fraud and computer misuse show how behind the curve our statistics have fallen  It is undeniable that the overall level of crime has been falling across the industrialised world for a quarter of a century as report after report on our experiences show we are less and less likely to be victims  However while traditional crimes such as burglary and theft fall criminal gangs look for new opportunities by exploiting gaps in online and banking security  The brutal fact is that nobody knows how big the problem is It is massively underreported and outside of London it is arguable that national policing hasnt yet got the skills or the expert manpower it needs  A good detective must have the skills to catch a burglar or killer but very few of them have the skills to analyse screens of information and find criminals who have taken the digital road to a life of crime While there was a 23 increase in attempted murders the ONS said this may have been influenced by improved crime recording Recorded offences involving a knife or sharp weapon hit their highest level for five years up 11 up on the previous year to 30838 There was a 7 rise in gun crime which BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said had been mainly driven by an increase in offences involving handguns and shotguns but added that some of the increase might be accounted for by better firearm identification processes Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard HoganHowe said the crime figures were akin to the warning lights flashing Investing in security Policing minister Brandon Lewis said reforms of the police were working and the offences traditionally measured by the survey  before the inclusion of fraud and cybercrime  had fallen by 370000 Mr Lewis said  the government was investing Â£19bn in cybersecurity over five years  adding that the survey helped inform efforts   Understanding more about these crimes will help us continue to protect those who are vulnerable he said View comments Related Topics Office for National

Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright PA The impact of George Osbornes shock announcement that police funding would be protected in real terms still has not been fully grasped  Two months have passed since the chancellor told MPs there would be no cuts in the overall policing budget from 201617 to 201920 but there has been little recognition of just how significant that statement was   It has subtly altered the political landscape fundamentally changed policing priorities and is set to shape the law and order agenda for the media  The Spending Review announcement came 12 days after the attacks in Paris which led to a debate about whether cuts to neighbourhood policing would erode intelligencegathering and if UK police firearms units had the capacity and capability to respond to an attack by marauding gunmen Politically it would have been very tricky for the chancellor to have gone ahead with a cuts programme without acknowledging those concerns but he went far further than anyone expected  The move outfoxed Labour which had argued police could withstand cutbacks of no more than 10  They did not think the chancellor would settle for anything less than that and were planning a fresh onslaught of their anticuts campaign   By design or default and I veer towards the design theory it also has placed Mr Osborne as the policemans friend  media caption Chancellor rolls back on police cuts He is seen as the man who saved the 43 forces in England and Wales from cuts they feared would be in the region of 2025   Why the chancellor would want to be cast in that role may have something to do with the unofficial contest to succeed David Cameron when he steps down as prime minister though I am sure he would deny it   Rivals for top job One of Mr Osbornes likely rivals is Theresa May the Home Secretary whose bold programme of policing changes and uncompromising style have made her deeply unpopular among the ranks of constables sergeants and inspectors   Mr Osbornes line towards the end of his statement The police protect us and were going to protect the police signalled a clear difference of tone from Mrs May image copyright PA image caption Theresa May has outlined plans for change Indeed in December the home secretary  told chief constables and police and crime commissioners PCCs  she would not have any sympathy for those who complained about existing budget cuts and that the new funding package did not insulate them from the need to make further efficiencies   It does not let you off the hook or mean you can slow the pace of change she said Now  more than ever before  there is no excuse not to deliver   Of course there are still anxieties within policing circles about the effect of central government funding cuts imposed since 2010 and whether forces can handle the record number of sexual abuse cases they are having to investigate   Revised proposals for a new funding formula after the previous bungled attempt will create losers as well as winners reigniting the concerns   But overall the media appetite for stories about police budgets is likely to dwindle Instead during the next five months in the leadup to the first PCC elections since November 2012 the focus will shift towards Mrs Mays latest plans  They include  enhanced powers for police volunteers which  I wrote about in November closer police working with other bluelight services giving PCCs greater responsibilities in particular  over their local fire brigades a strengthened role for the Independent Police Complaints Commission There has also been renewed speculation about a review of counterterrorism policing which could see powers transferred from Scotland Yard to the National Crime Agency    Outside influence Each proposal by itself may not be agendasetting or eyecatching   But the theme is clear  It represents a further loosening of the grip traditional police structures have had on law enforcement and a recognition that those outside the service have a vital part to play   The issue that may well dominate the PCC election campaign however is crime  The last set of data published in October 2015 suggested  more than seven million frauds and cybercrimes  had been committed in England and Wales in the 12 months to the end of June  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Cybercrime is a growing problem It was the first time there had been an estimate of fraud and online offences by the Office for National Statistics   If added to the authoritative Crime Survey which has been showing a decline in overall offending rates for two decades fraud would add 51 million offences to the total and computer hacking an extra 25 million somewhat blunting the governments proud message that crime is falling  What may well have happened is that criminals have switched from burgling houses stealing cars and robbing people to swindling us online Cybercrime and fraud Fraud  5110000 cases  3757000 victims Fraud with loss including those reimbursed2648000 cases  2079000 victims Fraud no loss 2462000 cases  1856000 victims Computer misuse 246000 cases  2113000 victims Unauthorised access to personal information including hacking 404000 cases  404000 victims Computer virus 2057000 cases  1741000 victims      Source National Office for Statistics year ending June 2015 All this has placed fraud and cybercrime firmly on the lawandorder map a position that will be cemented in July when the numbers are automatically included in the Crime Survey and then in October when provisional yearonyear comparisons become possible  There are also tentative signs that incidents of violence recorded by police may be increasing too with knife possession up 9 and murders at their highest level for four years  Police figures which rely on the public reporting offences and police recording them accurately must be treated with caution but the next set of data published on 21 January is keenly awaited

February Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Killing of Jamal Khashoggi image copyright Altitude Films image caption Jamal Khashoggi right was a prominent journalist and critic of Saudi Arabias government The Oscarwinning director of a documentary investigating the murder of Jamal Khashoggi says he does not believe Saudi Arabias crown prince will ever face formal investigation for his killing A newlyreleased US CIA report has  implicated Mohammed bin Salman  in the death of the Saudi journalist who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018 Bryan Fogels film The Dissident explores what happened to Khashoggi and who might have ordered his murder His body has never been recovered and the Saudi crown prince has denied involvement In November 2019 five men were tried and sentenced to death in a Saudi court for Khashoggis killing and three others were jailed The death sentences were later commuted to 20 years in prison Using transcripts obtained from the Turkish government Fogels film suggests that Khashoggi a journalist for the Washington Post who had exiled himself to the US was suffocated and then dismembered inside the consulate The film also investigates the use of spyware and phone hacking against Saudi activists living in exile These include Canadabased video blogger Omar Abdulaziz with whom Khashoggi was in close contact before his death Biden raises human rights in call with Saudi king What happened to Jamal Khashoggi I dont believe the crown prince is ever going to face an Interpol arrest warrant thatll pick him up when he lands his private jet somewhere and haul him off to The Hague or extradite him to Istanbul or the US says Fogel Thats never going to happen  This is the environment that we find ourselves in which is constantly in conflict with human rights Leaders like Mohammed bin Salman see their money can buy their way out of these sorts of events and there isnt accountability unless theres a cumulative and combined effort from countries image copyright Reuters image caption Mohammed bin Salman was made crown prince by his father King Salman in 2017 Fogel says he welcomes a reevaluation of ties between the US and Saudi Arabia under the Biden administration citing the close relationship the two countries had during Donald Trumps presidency Bidens definitely not following the playbook of Donald Trump the US director comments Signing off on the declassification and releasing the CIA findings into Khashoggis murder is a blow to USSaudi relations According to Fogel the recent release of human rights activist Loujain alHathloul after almost three years in detention is clearly a peace offering to the Biden administration Released Saudi activists family want justice Saudi woman activist jailed despite global outcry There appears to be support from both Democrats and Republicans to reexamine the relationship with Saudi Arabia in the light of the war in Yemen so time will tell he continues Fogels last investigative film Icarus won an Oscar in 2018 for exposing the scandal of statesponsored Russian doping in athletics The Dissident was also critically acclaimed following its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020 yet Fogel queries why global streaming services including Amazon and Netflix have not bought the film for their platforms  I think the film lays bare that unfortunately there is a contrition and a cowardice amongst these huge companies to take on subject matter that might affect their shareholder value or their business or investor interests even though they know hundreds of millions of people would be interested in watching the film he argues image copyright Altitude Films image caption Video blogger Omar Abdulaziz gives revealing testimony in Fogels film Fogel is also critical of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos the worlds richest person who also owns the Washington Post the newspaper that employed Khashoggi He chose not to acquire this film for global distribution on his platform Fogel says But a few months later he acquired Souq the socalled Amazon of Saudi Arabia Amazon actually acquired Souqcom in 2017  subsequently rebranding it as Amazonae Is Amazon still doing business with Saudi Arabia Yes says Fogel Is he actually standing up for the murder of his employee Hes certainly made some statements but actions speak louder than words Fogels film includes footage of a 2017 vigil held near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul which Bezos attended and spoke at image copyright Altitude Films image caption Hatice Cengiz right has accused Saudi Arabias crown prince of ordering her fiancÃ©es killing Im not mad at any of these companies the director goes on Its business But its disappointing as this sort of behaviour eventually allows murders like Jamal Khashoggis to happen and when theres no standing up for content like this it becomes increasingly difficult for filmmakers like myself But Im optimistic that the climate will change The aim of The Dissident its director says is not to make an archival film Its to make a living breathing thriller that looks deeply into Khashoggis murder and the ramifications of it he contends Fogel also interviews Khashoggis fiancÃ©e Turkish scientist Hatice Cengiz as well as Omar Abdulaziz whose activism was financially supported by Khashoggi Khashoggi fiancee sues Saudi crown prince Saudi court commutes Khashoggi death sentences The film puts forward the theory that this act may have tipped Jamal Khashoggi into being viewed as an activist and dissident himself rather than just an outspoken journalist But I think even in the final weeks of Jamals life he never saw himself as a dissident Fogel argues He was holding onto the notion that he was a journalist Yet what you see in the film is that the work he was doing and what he was writing about made him one at least as we understand it Jamal Khashoggi was someone who wanted to make his country a better place and was silenced in the most horrific way Fogel concludes In the film youll see that the choice he faced was either to stay in Saudi Arabia and be silent or leave Saudi risk his life and go into exile and speak truth to power It cost him his life The Dissident will have its UK premiere online at the Glasgow Film Festival on 6 March Follow us on  Facebook  or on Twitter

About sharing media caption Security experts give a live demonstration of mobile phone spyware Intelligence agencies secretive techniques for spying on mobile phones are seldom made public But a UK security firm has shown the BBC how one tool sold around the world to spooks actually works It allows spies to take secret pictures with a phones camera and record conversations with the microphone without the phone owner knowing Hacking Teams software was recently stolen from the company by hackers and published on the web Almost any data on a phone tablet or PC can be accessed by the tool and it is fascinating how much it can do When Joe Greenwood of cybersecurity firm 4Armed saw that source code for the program had been dumped online by hackers he couldnt resist experimenting with it Although he had to fiddle with the code to make it work it only took a day before he had it up and running The software consists of the surveillance console which displays data retrieved from a hacked device and malware planted on the target device itself 4Armed was careful to note that using it to spy on someone without their consent would be against the law Listening in After testing the software on his own PC Mr Greenwood soon realised the scope of its capabilities  You can download files record microphones webcam images websites visited see what programs are running intercept Skype calls he told the BBC The software even has some inbuilt features to track Bitcoin payments which can be difficult to associate with individuals without additional data about when and how transactions were performed In a live demonstration of the system Mr Greenwood showed how an infected phone could be made to record audio from the microphone even when the device was locked and use the phones camera without its owner knowing We can actually take photos without them realising  So the camera in the background is running taking photos every number of seconds explained Mr Greenwood It was also possible to listen in on phone calls access the list of contacts stored on the device and track what websites the phone user was visiting image caption The tool can record audio from a phones microphone even when the device is locked Both Mr Greenwood and 4Armeds technical director Marc Wickenden said they were surprised by the sleekness of the interface  Both point out though that customers could be paying upwards of Â£1m for the software and would expect it to be userfriendly especially if it was intended for use by law enforcers on the beat For the tracked user though there are very few ways of finding out that they are being watched One red flag according to Mr Greenwood is a sudden spike in network data usage indicating that information is being sent somewhere in the background Experienced spies however would be careful to minimise this in order to remain incognito At present spy software like this is only likely to be secretly deployed on the phones and computers of people who are key targets for an intelligence agency Spy catcher The version of the spyware distributed online is now likely to be more easily detected by antivirus programs because companies analysing the source code are in the process of updating their systems to recognise it Security expert Graham Cluley said it should be as easy to detect as malware The danger will be that malicious hackers could take that code and augment it or change it so it no longer looks like Hacking Teams versions which might avoid detection he added The best course of action said Mr Cluley is to keep operating systems and software as up to date as possible In a statement a spokesman for Hacking Team said it advised its customers not to use the software once the breach was discovered As soon as the event was discovered Hacking Team immediately advised all clients to discontinue the use of that version of the software and the company provided a patch to assure that client surveillance data and other information stored on client systems was secure  From the beginning Hacking Team has assumed that the code that has been released is compromised he said The spokesman added that the software would be operated by clients of Hacking Team not Hacking Team itself and therefore no sensitive data relating to ongoing investigations had been compromised in the breach Of course there are many who would use for their own purposes the information released by the criminals who attacked Hacking Team This was apparently not a concern of the attackers who recklessly published the material for all online   Compiling the software would take considerable technical skill so not just anyone could do that but that is not to say it is impossible he said Related Topics Computing Cybersecurity Mobile

spyware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24931374|Post Prism The new meaning of spyware By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter Published 22 November 2013 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption It may not just be the cybercriminals accessing your computer If you thought you were pretty clever knowing that spyware refers to pieces of malicious code put on computers in order for cybercriminals to steal your passwords and other IDs think again These days it has a much more literal sense at least if the latest documents leaked by former US National Security Agency NSA contractor Edward Snowden to the  Der Spiegel  newspaper are to be believed The documents allege that spies are regularly using tools more usually associated with cybercriminals It is alleged UK spy agency GCHQ operatives created fake web pages that injected malware into the computers of engineers running one of Belgiums largest telecommunications companies in order to be able to access its systems We have to realise that a number of GCHQ staff are indeed hackers  but licensed by the state and protected by the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and ministerial warrant said digital forensic expert Prof Peter Sommer They will deploy every type of hacker trick to achieve their aims It is a view endorsed by Dwayne Melancon chief technology officer of security firm Tripwire and a man used to looking at malicious code as part of his daily job  It seems you cant throw a rock these days without hitting a nation state surveillance operation he said It raised some pretty fundamental questions about whom we trust online said Prof Alan Woodward security expert and lecturer at Surrey University who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ When the criminals start to look like law enforcement that is a very dangerous practice he said Where do you draw the line Is it with engineers who control machines or should they be allowed to have malware on everyones PC just in case they want to use it as a route to some high value target Bespoke malware   image caption The police are also using the tools of the cybercriminals There is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that the use of malware is standard practice for the police as well as the intelligence services In the summer it was revealed that the FBI used mobile malware to infect and control a suspects handset And in September the FBI admitted that it had planted hidden code on the dark net a part of the internet favoured by cybercriminals because it is unreachable by standard search engines Security researchers who dissected the code found it exploited a security hole in Firefox which reported back to a mysterious server in northern Virginia  Meanwhile leaked German police documents suggest that the Federal Criminal Police Office is working on its own surveillance software which it hopes to have ready by the end of 2014  Accidental infection Prof Sommer said Id hope that the intelligence service uses highly targeted malware  So if they target someone specifically they send an email with a booby trap  but they will only be sending it to the target and the malware wouldnt have any selfreplicating properties But Mr Melancon is not so sure particularly if the authorities are using socalled watering hole websites which are popular with specific groups of users In the Belgian case GCHQ is alleged to have targeted LinkedIn and tech news site Slashdot in order to lure the engineers it was targeting Such sites are notoriously indiscriminate said Mr Melancon  You can limit the risk of accidental infection of uninvolved persons but you cant eliminate that risk entirely  Collateral damage and inadvertent surveillance of nontargeted individuals is almost certain  Legal framework The other big question raised by the allegations published by Der Spiegel is just whom the spooks are after If you hear the word target from an intelligence agency you probably assume they are referring to a terrorist or some other individual intent on harm  What the Belgian case reveals is that engineers can also be targets So is it ethical to put malware on the computer of an innocent employee who just happens to have access to a computer system you may want to look at If the result is damaging or destroying data or property then it could certainly be deemed unethical by a reasonable person   Likewise violating the civil liberties of an individual crosses the ethical line You can rationalise damage to engineers by lumping them into a collective as part of their organisation but this is very subjective said Mr Melancon For its part GCHQ offered a pretty standard response to the particular allegations about breaking into Belgian servers All GCHQs work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework which ensure that our activities are authorised necessary and proportionate and that there is rigorous oversight including from the secretary of state the Interception and intelligence services commissioners and the Intelligence and Security Committee it said The only way to be sure you too do not become a target is to consider all networks untrustworthy according to Robert Hansen technical evangelist at WhiteHat Security Unfortunately there isnt much hope for the individual because most of the things that would otherwise secure the user have historically been controlled by groups that have close ties to the government he said He is talking about the companies that register websites and encryption certificates Johnny English Sir Tim Berners Lee inventor of the world wide web has described attempts by spy agencies to crack encryption as appalling and foolish But through it all the general public seems to have been remarkably sanguine Prof Sommer said In Germany and the US people are outraged but in the UK that is less the case  People are rather proud of what GCHQ did during the war and they think it probably is not going to affect me What the Snowden leaks have dispelled once and for all is any lurking suspicion that the security forces are some bumbling Johnny English sort of outfit The fact is that intelligence agencies are using advanced techniques actually more advanced than those used by criminals said Amichai Shulman chief technology officer of security firm Imperva We have enough proof now that governments do have the necessary technology and personnel that can effectively fight cybercrime They just chose to put it to a different use

sharing In April Faustin Rukundo received a mysterious call over WhatsApp from a number he did not recognise  He answered but the line was silent and then it went dead He tried calling back but nobody answered He didnt know it but his phone had been compromised As a Rwandan exile living in Leeds Mr Rukundo was already privacy conscious He searched for the number online and found the dialling code was from Sweden  Strange he thought But he soon forgot about it  Then the number called once more Again nobody picked up  There were also missed calls from other numbers he did not recognise and he began to get worried about his familys safety so he bought a new phone  Within a day the unknown number called again  I tried to answer and they hung up before I heard any voice Mr Rukundo told the BBC  Whenever I called back noone answered I realised something was wrong when I started seeing files missing from the phone I spoke to my colleagues at the Rwanda National Congress and they too had similar experiences They were getting missed calls from the same numbers as me The Rwanda National Congress is a group that opposes the Rwandan regime It was not until May when Mr Rukundo read reports that WhatsApp had been hacked that he realised what had happened  I first read the story about the WhatsApp hack on the BBC and thought Wow this could explain whats happened to me he said I changed my phone and realised my mistake They were following my number around and putting the spy software on each new device by calling the same number   image copyright Reuters image caption Victims did not need to answer the call For months Mr Rukundo was convinced that he and his colleagues were some of the estimated 1400 people targeted by attackers exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp But it was only confirmed to him this week following a call from Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto For six months the organisation has been working with Facebook to investigate the hack and find out who was affected  Researchers there say As part of our investigation into the incident Citizen Lab has identified over 100 cases of abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe Mr Rukundos profile as an outspoken critic of the Rwandan regime is consistent with the sort of people who were targets for this spyware It was allegedly built and sold by the Israelbased NSO Group and sold to governments around the world Hackers used the software to spy on journalists human rights activists political dissidents and diplomats Mr Rukundo says he has not had any calls since the original hack but the experience has made him and his family feel paranoid and scared Honestly even before they confirmed this we were gutted and terrified It looks like they only bugged my phone for around two weeks but they had access to everything he told the BBC Not only my activity during that time but my whole email history and all my contacts and connections Everything is watched the computers our phones nothing is safe Even when we talk they could be listening I still dont feel safe Mr Rukundo fled Rwanda in 2005 when critics of the government were being arrested and jailed He says he fought to have his wife released after she was kidnapped and detained for two months on a family visit in 2007 Facebook the owner of WhatsApp is attempting to sue the NSO Group The NSO Group denies any wrongdoing In court documents Facebook accuses the company of exploiting a thenunknown vulnerability in WhatsApp The app is used by approximately 15 billion people in 180 countries  The service is popular for its endtoend encryption which means messages are scrambled as they travel across the internet making them unreadable if intercepted The filing at the US District Court of Northern California describes how the spyware was allegedly installed  The powerful software known as Pegasus is an NSO Group product that can remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from mobile devices by sharing all phone activity including communications and location data with the attacker  WhatsApp discovers targeted surveillance attack WhatsApp sues Israeli firm over phone hacking claims In previous spyware attacks victims have been tricked into downloading the software by clicking on boobytrapped web links But with the WhatsApp hack Facebook alleges that it was installed on victims phones without them taking any action at all  The company says that between January 2018 and May 2019 NSO Group created WhatsApp accounts using telephone numbers registered in different counties including Cyprus Israel Brazil Indonesia Sweden and the Netherlands Then in April and May the victims were attacked with a phone call over WhatsApp it is claimed The filing says To avoid the technical restrictions built into WhatsApp Signaling Servers defendants formatted call initiation messages containing malicious code to appear like a legitimate call and concealed the code within call settings Disguising the malicious code as call settings enabled defendants to deliver it to the target device and made the malicious code appear as if it originated from WhatsApp Signaling Servers image copyright AFP The victims would be completely unaware that they had been bugged In some cases the only thing they noticed were mysterious missed calls in WhatsApp logs  The document states that Facebook believes the hack was an abuse of its computer network wants an injunction stopping the NSO Group having any access to its platforms accepts that NSO Group was allegedly carrying out the hacks on behalf of its customers but Facebook is going after the company as the architects who created the software NSO Group has been accused of supplying the spyware that let the killers of journalist Jamal Khashoggi track him down  NSO Group denies involvement in that incident and says it will fight these latest allegations In the strongest possible terms we dispute todays allegations

link About sharing image copyright Reuters It was the week when we learned that a missed WhatsApp call could plant spyware on your phone and when San Francisco moved to ban facial recognition technology  On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals  but also be used to track our every move Listen to  the latest  Tech Tent  podcast on BBC Sounds When WhatsApps owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call it was unusually open about who might be behind it The firm briefed journalists that the attack had all the hallmarks of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israels NSO Group which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists  The University of Torontos Citizen Lab which monitors digital attacks against civil society has been tracking the NSO Group for some years  Its senior researcher John ScottRailton tells Tech Tent that Facebooks decision to be so upfront about who was responsible suggests that it was pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSOs Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico via the oldfashioned method of persuading them to click on a link Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp being used to target  unsuccessfully  a Londonbased human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists image copyright Getty Images image caption Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a boobytrapped link He says the spyware is quite insidious Once it gets on to a phone that phone is basically like a spy in the victims pockets the microphone can be turned on encrypted chats can be taken off the phone private photographs and so on NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour  The Israeli firm said in a statement NSOs technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror  The company does not operate the system and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions  Since earlier this year the company has been majority owned by Novalpina a Londonbased private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO We asked him for an interview He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April  before the WhatsApp hack emerged  to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpinas ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon At its annual general meeting next week its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government image copyright Getty Images image caption Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing nonwhite faces The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places Mary Beth Gallagher representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used Even if its 100 accurate we dont want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society Just like NSO Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways such as helping to find victims of child trafficking  But asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job The  right organisations to handle those issues are policymakers and government Surveillance technology  whether that is facial recognition or spyware  is a very lucrative industry shrouded in secrecy But

and pretend that I hadnt seen anything The first moment I could I went to the library to use the computer and look up the spyware hed used Thats when everything made sense after months of thinking I was going crazy Stalkerware  also known as spouseware  are powerful surveillance software programs typically sold openly online On a device all messages can be read screen activity recorded GPS locations tracked and cameras used to spy on what an individual is doing     Getty Sidestep stalkerware Tips to avoid being victimised Donât leave device unattended â most software requires physical access Ditch fingerprint lock  a partner can use your print while you sleep Add security app  antivirus software can also detect spyware and remove it Source BBC According to cybersecurity company Kaspersky the number of people who have discovered such software on their devices has risen by at least 35 in the past year Kaspersky researchers say their protection technologies have detected stalkerware on 37532 devices so far this year  And principal security researcher David Emm says this is the tip of a very large iceberg Most people will routinely protect a laptop or desktop not that many people actually protect a mobile device he says This information is coming back from installations of our product on smartphones so this figure doesnt even go close to what the total would be Webwise An introduction to spyware The apps that let parents spy on their kids Spyware use in domestic violence escalating Kasperskys findings indicate Russia is the country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity India Brazil the United States and Germany complete the top five with the UK in eighth place with 730 detections Another security company says there are practical steps people can take if they suspect they are already being spied on Its always advisable to check which apps are on your phone and conduct a virus scan where necessary and if there are any apps on your device that you do not recognise it is worth searching online for reviews and deleting them says Jake Moore from Eset As a general rule if you arent using an app delete it Once Amy realised her computer had been compromised she developed a severe mistrust of technology which she is only just overcoming Charities say this is a common psychological response to such a trauma  Jessica was another victim of stalkerware Her exhusband routinely spied on her through her phones microphone and would play mind games by repeating specific phrases she and her friends had used in private conversations Its been years since she escaped the relationship but she still leaves her phone locked in the car when seeing friends image copyright Getty Images image caption Stalkerware is often used to monitor victims locations and messages Gemma Toynton from domestic abuse charity Safer Places says she see this longterm effect a lot in her cases  It reduces someones trust she says It makes them see a phone or laptop as a weapon because thats what its been used for Technology has become in their minds like a net around them and a lot of people do withdraw from using the internet It really does impact your whole life The fact that this stalkerware is on the rise is a real concern Amy who is from the US is now divorced and lives many miles away from her exhusband  She has a restraining order preventing him from direct contact with her and he is legally allowed to communicate logistics about their sons care via written letter only Put to the test image copyright Getty Images image caption Abusers have been known to use victims fingerprints to access phones to install the software I tested out one of the most popular consumer products which costs Â£140 for three months of surveillance I bought it online and installed it on to my work phone It took me about an hour and I used the 24hour live support offered by the company when I encountered any problems Spyware companies advertise their services as employee monitoring or parental control products  In many countries including the UK using the spyware on a spouse without their permission is illegal so many of the companies websites are littered with disclaimers advising against this However some of the same websites link to articles seemingly written by associates recommending the software as a spy tool for cheatings wives and husbands  In a live chat with the company whose product I was testing I directly told them I want to install this on my wifes phone will it be secret  The customer servicerepresentative responded The application will start to work in stealth mode right after installation Ill be happy to help I also downloaded five of the top cybersecurity products on to the infected mobile and carried out a free scan  All of them gave alerts for potentially harmful software  The Crown Prosecution Service says there arent specific laws related to the use of stalkerware but any criminal activity like this can be prosecuted by a number of means including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 Amy says more should be done to legislate against the use of these technologies  They need to stop hiding behind plausible deniability she says  There is a wink thats given when they send this little disclaimer that says We dont approve of you spying on wives They know what their customers are doing though This software causes real harm Related Topics Domestic abuse Cyberstalking Phone Hacking Cybersecurity

platform  WhatsApp has filed a lawsuit against Israeli firm NSO Group alleging it was behind the cyberattacks that infected devices in April and May NSO Group which makes software for surveillance says it only works with government agencies The government has denied the claims  These attempts to malign the government of India for the reported breach are completely misleading a government statement read adding that it would take strict action against those responsible for the attack India has also asked WhatsApp for a detailed explanation Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a statement on Twitter  Government of India is concerned at the breach of privacy of citizens of India on the messaging platform Whatsapp We have asked Whatsapp to explain the kind of breach and what it is doing to safeguard the privacy of millions of Indian citizens 14  pictwittercomYI9Fg1fWro — Ravi Shankar Prasad rsprasad  October 31 2019   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites View original tweet on Twitter NSO Group has also denied the allegations against them In the strongest possible terms we dispute the allegations and vigorously fight them NSO Group said in a statement to the BBC The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime it added  How did the hack take place Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices by using a major vulnerability in the messaging app Targets received video or voice call requests from an unknown number  which even if ignored allowed the spyware known as Pegasus to be installed on the device This allowed users to remotely access everything on the phone including text messages and location WhatsApp has not disclosed the number of Indians targeted  While I cannot reveal their identities and the exact number I can say that it is not an insignificant number WhatsApp spokesperson Carl Woog told The Indian Express newspaper Who has been targeted Indian news site Scroll says it has confirmed that at least 17 individuals including  activists scholars and journalists were affected by the breach   The profile of the private Indian citizens targeted in this case suggests the involvement of state agencies in India technology writer Prasanto K Roy told the BBC These people are all activists journalists and lawyers who work with or represent tribal people and dalits formerly untouchables in sensitive areas where people have clashed with the state image copyright Getty Images Mr Roy added that the list of people targeted so far is very specific I cant think of a single foreign government not even Pakistan who would be interested in these particular private citizens Lawyer Nihalsing Rathod who has defended human rights activists arrested after castebased violence broke out in the western state of Maharashtra in

steps including advertising in newspapers and limiting the number of forwards a single user could send to five It also marked messages that had been forwarded with a label  Since then the government has gone a step further by saying that it would introduce new rules in January 2020 that would allow it to monitor intercept and trace social media messages In response WhatsApp has said this would

Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Israeli and UAE flags lined this road in the Israeli coastal city of Netanya Historic A breakthrough A gamechanger A betrayal there is no shortage of epithets for this months sudden announcement  by President Trump  that the United Arab Emirates UAE is to fully normalise its relations with Israel  After Egypts peace treaty with Israel in 1979 followed by Jordans in 1994 this makes the UAE only the third Arab country to normalise relations It is the first of the six Arab Gulf states to do so Oman Bahrain and possibly Morocco are widely expected to follow Discreet contacts between the UAE and Israel had been under way for years but still the details and timing of this normalisation deal were kept secret right up to the last minute There were no consultations between the UAE foreign ministry in Abu Dhabi and its Arab neighbours Almost everyone was taken by surprise most of all the Palestinians who called it a stab in the back since they have yet to come close to getting a state of their own or ending Israeli occupation  For the Palestinians there is zero upside here comments Emile Hokayem from the Londonbased International Institute for Strategic Studies For the UAEs de facto ruler Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed known as MBZ this deal is something of a gamble but one with the odds heavily in his favour  The risk is it could make the UAE leadership highly unpopular in the wider Arab world where some social media postings have been calling it a sellout Were the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to renege on his promise to temporarily shelve annexation of parts of the West Bank then that would be extremely embarrassing for the Emiratis and possibly see the whole deal unravel  media caption Israel annexation What is the West Bank But such a move would also draw disapproval from the White House and besides popular street protests are not usually tolerated in the Gulf  In the short term the pitfalls for the UAE are very limited says Mr Hokayem This deal is not going to affect the UAE regimes stability It reflects the changing geopolitics of the region and it buys the UAE a lot of goodwill in the US where its image has been tarnished by its involvement in the Yemen war Israel and UAE strike historic peace deal What does Trumpâs MidEast plan say on key issues Explainer Israel annexation and the West Bank So what is behind this deal and whats in it for this relatively young Gulf nation and former British protectorate that only became a sovereign nation in 1971 In short it is two things  strategic advantage and technology  The UAE along with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia has a deep mistrust even a fear of its giant heavilyarmed neighbour across the water Iran  image copyright EPA image caption Palestinians condemned the UAEs decision to normalise relations with Israel Gulf Arab leaders look at the map of the region and they note how despite crippling sanctions Irans strategic presence has advanced rapidly across the Middle East ever since the bulwark of Saddam Husseins regime was removed in Iraq  Where once Iran was largely confined to its national borders today it has proxy militias in Iraq Syria Lebanon and Yemen Israel shares this concern especially when it comes to Irans secretive nuclear programme  Then there is what is known as Islamism or political Islam a transnational concept often embodied by the Muslim Brotherhood and one which certain Gulf Arab rulers view as an existential threat to their dynastic monarchies Noone dislikes the Muslim Brotherhood more fervently than the UAE crown prince and this has led to the UAE backing antiMuslim Brotherhood factions as far away as Libya while seeing its interests clash increasingly with those of Turkeys Islamist government  In practice this has led to the formation of an unofficial partnership of conservative Middle Eastern governments a de facto club to which Israel with its formidable intelligence capabilities is now being admitted as an associate member And there is technology including biotech healthcare defence and cyber surveillance Here the UAE already has form having purchased Israelimanufactured spyware some years ago to keep an eye on its own citizens The UAE has deep pockets  it has vast oil reserves and a per capita GDP of nearly 40000 Â£30000 It also has ambitions globally and beyond having just become the first Arab country to send a mission to Mars  media caption Jared Kushner This is a dramatic breakthrough that will make the Middle East safer Israel is by far the most technologically advanced country in the Middle East with cuttingedge inventions If this alliance works out it could propel the UAE to a new level of prosperity and international prestige while safeguarding future jobs for its citizens  Israels overtures to the Gulf go back some way In 1995 shortly before Israels Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist he sent his Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on an official visit to Oman and Qatar Lowkey Israeli trade offices then opened up in both countries capitals I remember calling up their office in Muscat for a comment  the Israeli representative inadvertently answered the phone with the Hebrew greeting Shalom before quickly changing it to the Arabic Salaamu aleikum  The trade initiative withered away after Mr Netanyahu became prime minister Israel intervened in Lebanon and the second Palestinian intifada erupted But more recently quiet diplomacy between Israel and the Gulf states has accelerated as a fear of Iranian expansionism has become the prime preoccupation Bahrain Oman and Qatar may well follow the UAE if this months announcement passes without major incident image copyright Anadolu Agency image caption Oman does not have official relations with Israel but senior officials are in contact with each other Saudi Arabia may take longer But back in 2002 it was the Saudis who launched the Crown Prince Abdullah Peace Plan at the Beirut Arab summit offering Israel full recognition in exchange for a return to its pre1967 borders The deal briefly put Israeli PM Ariel Sharon on the spot but days later Hamas carried out bombings and all talks were off Today the Middle East is a very different place and what was then unthinkable is now a reality  Guess what were the most searchedfor words online in the UAE immediately after the deal was announced said an Emirati official It was hotels in Israel A lot of people cant wait to visit

media caption Sumit Jain Indias ban on 59 Chinese apps including the wildly popular TikTok and WeChat platforms has left millions of users surprised and disappointed The government in Delhi said the apps were prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India defence of India security of state and public order TikTok denied sharing any data with the Chinese government Beijing said it was strongly concerned about the ban  Experts describe the ban as a political move amid rising bilateral tensions TikTok star faces uncertain future after app ban AntiChina sentiment has been high in India since the clashes earlier this month  at the disputed border between the two nucleararmed neighbours left 20 Indian troops dead   China gave no details on whether there were any Chinese casualties The fighting occurred in the Himalayan region of Ladakh where both countries have increased deployment close to the disputed border  Calls to boycott Chinese goods soon emerged and the government issued directives to cancel or limit Chinese contracts with public sector companies  But the ban on the apps took many by surprise The list includes the microblogging platform Weibo the strategy game Clash of Kings Alibabas UC Browser and ecommerce apps Club Factory and Shein The app makers have said they are in talks with the Indian government while Beijing has asked India to reconsider its decision We want to stress that Chinese government always asks Chinese businesses to abide by international and local lawsregulations Indian government has a responsibility to uphold the legal rights of international investors including Chinese ones ANI news agency quotes Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian as saying What prompted the ban Indias Ministry of Information Technology has said the ban was the result of many complaints from various sources about apps that were stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users data in an unauthorised manner Many of the Chinese apps have been linked to controversies over data privacy and have been accused of sharing sensitive information with the Chinese government US senators have even called for an investigation into TikTok which fiercely rejects such claims media caption Geet The Indian government said in its statement that the compilation of these data its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures This isnt the first time Chinese apps have been banned in India In 2017 Alibabas UC Browser came under scrutiny for allegedly leaking mobile data of Indian users And that year Indias defence ministry asked all armed personnel and officers to uninstall 42 Chinese apps it classified as spyware according to media reports  Some however believe that the timing of the ban  amid escalating tensions  is not coincidental but rather a response to the events at the border This is a purely political move Nikhil Pahwa the editor of MediaNama a media watchdog told the BBC I dont think it will affect the apps  maybe the number of the users will drop but it will only have a minor impact on their revenue Mr Pahwa said So what is the impact of the ban The ban is already affecting millions of users across India who are unable to use the blacklisted apps As China has shown governments can indeed block apps  not just remove them from the app stores which has already happened in India so you cant install them afresh or upgrade an existing install says tech policy expert Prasanto K Roy  He adds that although there are ways to get around the ban it will effectively kill popular apps If over 95 of 100 million users exit that kills the network effect and most of the content and hence an app like TikTok is no longer attractive India is TikToks biggest foreign market with an estimated 120 million active users TikTok allows users to publish and share short videos  In the years since it has launched in India the app has become a platform for Indians of all ages and classes  from police constables to housewives  who  dance sing and perform for their followers The app has turned many ordinary Indians into social media stars   media caption The engineer whose floral headpieces went viral And Mr Roy says the ban will hurt all Indians who were making money and business connections through these apps The thousands of TikTok influencers who were making a living off the platform and the many Indian traders and businessmen who need to connect to people in China and do that over WeChat âthis cuts them off He agrees that there is cause for concern around how the apps treat user data but he says the response should be in the form of a privacy law which India doesnt have  Its a soft strike at the Chinese payback for the claimed border violations and recent violent conflict he adds What do the appmakers say TikToks parent company ByteDance told the BBC it is committed to working with the Indian government to demonstrate our dedication to user security and our commitment to the country overall Nikhil Gandhi TikToks India head said on Twitter that the company had been invited to meet concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications Other app makers are yet to respond to the ban Experts say that most of these firms will try to lobby policy makers but they are not likely to be allowed as long as tensions continue at the border and antiChina sentiments remain

About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption WhatsApp has 15bn users but it believed the attacks were highlytargeted Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices using a major vulnerability in messaging app WhatsApp it has been confirmed WhatsApp which is owned by Facebook said the attack targeted a select number of users and was orchestrated by an advanced cyberactor  A fix was rolled out on Friday  On Monday WhatsApp urged all of its 15 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution  The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firm  NSO Group  according to a report in the  Financial Times   Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran Facebook first discovered the flaw in WhatsApp earlier in May WhatsApp promotes itself as a secure communications app because messages are  endtoend encrypted  meaning they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipients device  However the surveillance software would have let an attacker read the messages on the targets device Some users of the app have questioned why the app store notes associated with the latest update are not explicit about the fix image copyright Twitter Journalists lawyers activists and human rights defenders are most likely to have been targeted said  Ahmed Zidan  from the nonprofit Committee to Protect Journalists How do I update WhatsApp Android Open the  Google Play  store Tap the menu at the top left of the screen Tap My Apps  Games If WhatsApp has recently been updated it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated the button will say Update Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on Android is 219134 iOS Open the  App Store At the bottom of the screen tap Updates If WhatsApp has recently been updated it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated the button will say Update Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on iOS is 21951 How was the security flaw used It involved attackers using WhatsApps voice calling function to ring a targets device  Even if the call was not picked up the surveillance software could be installed According to the FT report the call would often disappear from the devices call log  WhatsApp told the BBC its security team was the first to identify the flaw It shared that information with human rights groups selected security vendors and the US Department of Justice earlier this month  The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systemsâ the company said on Monday in a briefing document note for journalists  What is encryption What we know about the secretive NSO Group The firm also published an  advisory to security specialists  in which it described the flaw as A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP voice over internet protocol stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP secure realtime transport protocol packets sent to a target phone numberâ  Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said it was a pretty oldfashioned method of attack A buffer overflow is where a program runs into memory it should not have access to  It overflows the memory it should have and hence has access to memory in which malicious code can potentially be run he explained If you are able to pass some code through the app you can run your own code in that area In VOIP there is an initial process that dials up and establishes the call and the flaw was in that bit Consequently you did not need to answer the call for the attack to work Who is behind the software The NSO Group is an Israeli company that has been referred to in the past as a cyberarms dealer  While some cybersecurity companies report the flaws they find so that they can be fixed others keep problems to themselves so they can be exploited or sold to law enforcement  The NSO Group is  partowned by the Londonbased private equity firm Novalpina Capital  which acquired a stake in February NSOs flagship software Pegasus has the ability to collect intimate data from a target device including capturing data through the microphone and camera and gathering location data  In a statement the group said NSOs technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror  On the frontline of Indias WhatsApp fake news war WhatsApp sets new rules after mob killings The company does not operate the system and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions We investigate any credible allegations of misuse and if necessary we take action including shutting down the system  Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation Who has been targeted WhatsApp said it was too early to know how many users had been affected by the vulnerability although it added that suspected attacks were highlytargeted   According to the  New York Times  one of the people targeted was a Londonbased lawyer involved in a lawsuit against the NSO Group Amnesty International which said it had been targeted by tools created by the NSO Group in the past said this attack was one human rights groups had long feared was possible Theyre able to infect your phone without you actually taking an action said Danna Ingleton deputy programme director for Amnesty Tech She said there was mounting evidence that the tools were being used by regimes to keep prominent activists and journalists under surveillance There needs to be some accountability for this it cant just continue to be a wild west secretive industry On Tuesday a Tel Aviv court will hear a petition led by Amnesty International that calls for Israels Ministry of Defence to revoke the NSO Groups licence to export its products What are the unanswered questions How many people were targeted  WhatsApp says it is too early in its investigation to say how many people were targeted or how long the flaw was present in the app Does updating WhatsApp remove the spyware  While the update fixes the flaw that let this attack take place WhatsApp has not said whether the update removes any spyware that has already infected a compromised device What could the spyware do  WhatsApp has not said whether the attack could extend beyond the confines of WhatsApp reaching further into a device and accessing emails photos and more Using an app as an attack route is limited on iOS as they run apps in very tightly controlled sandboxes said Prof Woodward Were all assuming that the attack was just a corruption of WhatsApp but analysis is still ongoing The nightmare scenario would be if you could get something much more capable onto the device without the user having to do anything he said The BBC has asked WhatsApp for clarification

Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images These are strange times Germany perhaps the most privacy conscious nation on earth is considering a mobile phone app that would trace the contacts of anyone infected with Covid19  Earlier this week the British Prime Minister  shared a picture of an online Cabinet meeting  complete with the Zoom meeting ID and the usernames of ministers And millions of us are sharing views of our kitchens over this and other videoconferencing apps without apparently being too concerned about poor privacy controls Meanwhile the National Health Service in England has sent out a document that appears to mark a shift in its policy on patient data  giving staff more latitude to share information relating to the coronavirus  In particular it mentions the use of data to understand trends in the spread and impact of the virus and and the management of patients with or at risk of Covid19 including locating contacting screening flagging and monitoring such patients  In other words hospital staff and GPs who until now may have been cautious almost to the point of paranoia about data protection can chill out a little  Stream  or  download  the latest  Tech Tent  podcast Listen live every Friday at 1400 GMT on the BBC World Service As someone who has previously been asked by my optician to take pictures on my phone of an eye scan and take them to a hospital doctor because they were not permitted to email them the new policy seems sensible So are we becoming more relaxed about privacy because of the pandemic or are we in danger of allowing governments and corporations to trample over our rights using the excuse of the emergency The former Portuguese Europe Minister Bruno Macaes now a writer and commentator made it clear where he stands in this startling tweet The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites View original tweet on Twitter The idea that any concern about privacy in the battle against the virus is not only irrelevant but could prove fatal is at one extreme of this argument  At the other are some privacy campaigners who appear to think that any form of monitoring people with the virus risks the creation of a surveillance state We can see this battle playing out in the debate over the contacttracing apps now being considered by a number of European countries including the UK  A press conference with a consortium of European scientists aiding their development began with a clear declaration about putting privacy at their core HansChristian Boos an AI entrepreneur and adviser to Chancellor Merkel is one of the initiatives leaders He said one of the motivating factors was to address the question Can we really build proximitytracing while preserving privacy completely  It is possible they concluded if the system is built round the use of Bluetooth signals and anonymous IDs Singapores TraceTogether which already does this is being cited as a good example But some countries are taking a less cautious approach  Russias Social Monitoring app for citizens who have tested positive for Covid19  will request access to calls location camera storage network information and other data to check they do not leave their home while contagious Taiwan has been using network data to monitor citizens in quarantine  in one case resulting in a man getting a visit from the police 45 minutes  after his phone went flat And perhaps the most extreme option is a software tool being touted by the Israeli spyware firm NSO Group  It envisages governments telling mobile phone operators to hand over all their data on the movements of every subscriber   When I asked an NHS official whether such an approach would be feasible here I could almost hear him turn white over the phone  A SIMPLE GUIDE   How do I protect myself AVOIDING CONTACT  The rules on selfisolation and exercise LOOKUP TOOL  Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS  Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO  The 20second hand wash The team working on an app for the UK is acutely conscious that it needs to retain the trust of the public if they are to achieve a target of getting about 60 of the population to install it when released  Telling citizens their government will be logging their every move would be a clear deterrent  But heres the problem Getting apps and other technology solutions out there fast while cutting a few privacy corners could mean that lockdowns and the other restrictions on daily life might be be eased earlier  Countries like the UK which are more cautious about privacy are likely to be slower in rolling out contacttracing technology  and that may mean they are locked down for longer So might the public be willing to trade one kind of freedom   the right to privacy  for another  the right to leave their homes and return to work  As with so many areas of our lives the virus is forcing us to confront difficult questions about our priorities Related Topics Privacy Coronavirus lockdown measures Internet privacy Coronavirus pandemic Cybersecurity NHS Apps More on this story Israeli spyware firm pitches to be Covid19 saviour

spent two years working in London with a source describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence to US news network CNN And now BBC Arabic can reveal he was trained how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state What we know about Saudi journalists disappearance Whos who in alleged Saudi hit squad Saudi Arabia profile  The source who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity has visually confirmed his identity from pictures circulated in the media in the days since Mr Khashoggis disappearance According to him Mr Mutreb was introduced as an intelligence security operative The spyware trainers however nicknamed him dark face Because he looked always grumpy like he was on the sad sideâ¦ he was very silent the source added Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to Mr Khashoggi insisting he left the consulate soon after getting routine paperwork Trained to target citizens The European surveillance expert described how Mr Mutreb spent two weeks on a course with him in 2011 learning how to use the technology his company was providing the Saudi government so that it could carry out targeted attacks on the phones and computers of its own citizens  The training involved things like infecting a computer from potential targets of interest for intelligence and extracting information so digital evidence information about this person of

iconic words from German Lutheran Pastor Martin Niemoller criticising silence when faced with evil in his books and speeches On Wednesday when he turns 70 in a Mumbai jail where hes been imprisoned for 90 days his family and friends are trying to ensure that hes not greeted with silence Scores of letters and cards wishing him well on his birthday are expected to be delivered at Taloja jail where hes being held Anand is a respected academic whos been shut away for completely dubious reasons Balmurli Natrajan professor of anthropology at William Paterson University in New Jersey who is among the people writing a letter to Prof Teltumbde told the BBC We want him to know that we are constantly thinking of him reading his books Counted among Indias bestknown public intellectuals Prof Teltumbde has authored 30 books and is known for his incisive writing on Indias harsh caste system Born to a Dalit formerly untouchables in Indias rigid caste system family he worked in top positions

antiterrorism law that makes it almost impossible to get bail Police accuse them of instigating caste violence at a Dalit rally in Bhima Koregaon village in the western state of Maharashtra on 1 January 2018  Although those detained werent present in the village at the time police blamed the violence on their speeches at a meeting the night before They are also accused of working in tandem with the Naxalites  banned ultraleft Maoist rebels  to overthrow the government and cause chaos in India Indian academic surrenders over violence charges But Indian and international campaigners and rights organisations working for their release say theyve been jailed for criticising the state All the 11 activists have worked relentlessly to protect the rights of some of Indias most marginalised people including Dalits and tribals Amnesty International said in one of the several statements it has put out in the past few months calling for their release Human Rights Watch  has called the detentions wrongful and politically motivated and questioned why the government did not investigate the allegations that Hindu nationalist leaders may have had a role in the Bhima Koregaon violence  In May the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights wrote to Home Minister Amit Shah saying it was alarmed by the intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders by the authorities The letter also urged India to immediately release all prisoners  in view of the coronavirus pandemic  most of the detainees are elderly with underlying health conditions and thus at serious risk of catching the infection in overcrowded jails  image copyright Getty Images image caption A day after a Dalit rally was attacked in Bhima Koregaon in January 2018 protests spilled out onto the streets of Mumbai Prof Natrajan says India has always been a marketplace of ideas pointing out that Nobel laureate Amartya Sen once called Indians argumentative But in the past eight years the space for argument and debate has been shrinking Prof Teltumbde he says has been setting the contours of key debates on globalisation and politics of caste and religion for the past 30 years Hes been calling out caste deniers and Hindu triumphalism Hes dared to point fingers at the powerful classes  hes telling them heres what youre doing and how its put a majority of Indian people in misery And that makes him a dangerous man Prof Teltumbde says his wife Rama was shocked when his name first came up two years back in the list of accused in the Bhima Koregaon case We hadnt even imagined it in our worst dreams that something like this could ever happen to us she told me on the phone from Mumbai My husband is not a criminal she says her voice breaking with emotion Hes an academic a workaholic who spent 1415 hours daily reading writing and teaching In his free time she says he would try to help the poor and the marginalised because he wanted to see an India thats better more just To be thrown into jail for that is a very high price to pay Since her husband has been jailed Mrs Teltumbde has been allowed a weekly twominute phone call with him India jails pregnant student despite Covid19 risk I always ask him hows his health And hows the prison food because I know the food there is very bad He doesnt want to worry us so he always says hes fine And then he asks about his mother and our daughters Mrs Teltumbde is the granddaughter of Bhimrao Ambedkar  the author of Indias constitution and an icon to millions of Dalits  and says she believes that her grandfather wouldnt recognise todays India I dont think he envisaged this kind of India where people are arrested for speaking their mind We live in a democracy and freedom of speech is a right guaranteed under the constitution But critics say its a right that is under grave threat in todays India Those criticising PM Modi are attacked on social media by nationalist trolls and activists and students opposing the government are being jailed Most of the dissenters are charged under UAPA and being held in prison without bail Earlier this year police in Delhi arrested several students who had protested against a controversial new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims They were labelled as antinationals working to break up India by news channels friendly to the government Female

condemnation  image caption A letter written by a 10yearold student to Prof Anand Teltumbde on his birthday The government is playing with the liberties of people by arresting them under flimsy charges says Mihir Desai Prof Teltumbdes lawyer The central charge against Prof Teltumbde he says is that he was helping the Naxalites by getting them recruits and spreading their ideology and that he was taking money from them But when they raided his house he says they did not find any arms or cash The only evidence the police have put forth so far are four letters that they waved at a press conference Mr Desai says they are typed and unsigned and there are no addresses or email addresses on them He says they are not written by Prof Teltumbde or addressed to him  the one thing they all have in common is the mention of an Anand which is a common Indian name These letters appear to be manufactured he says adding that even if they are real how do they prove that this Anand is Prof Teltumbde Also anyone can write anything to anyone but is that proof These cant exist as evidence The evidence is unlikely to stand scrutiny in court Mr Desai says but its the process thats the punishment If a person is jailed for 10 years while the case goes on their life is ruined  As Prof Teltumbde completes three months in prison his wife Rama says their only demand is for him to be freed on bail and the government to start the trial soon so that his name can be cleared A day before he was taken into custody  Prof Teltumbde wrote an open letter  where he detailed the harassment he says hes faced in the past two years  he wrote about how his home was raided his Wikipedia page was vandalised and how the  government inserted Israeli spyware on his phone   As I see my India being ruined it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim momentâ¦ I do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again However I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes he wrote By jailing him Prof Natrajan says the government is trying to crush the very people who are trying to reason and debate But mark my words Anand will not be crushed You can jail

demanded an immediate investigation into allegations Saudi Arabias crown prince hacked Amazon boss Jeff Bezoss phone They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for continuous direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezoss data The kingdoms US embassy has denied the absurd story But the independent UN experts  Agnes Callamard special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings and David Kaye special rapporteur on freedom of expression  said the crown princes possible involvement had to be investigated Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos  who also owns the Washington Post  worsened after Jamal Khashoggi a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspapers staff was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018 Saudis sentence five over Khashoggi murder How Saudi Arabias crown prince rose to power The killing took place months after the alleged cyberhack took place Mr Bezoss phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown princes personal account  according to the Guardian newspaper which broke the story An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaires phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file What did the experts say In a statement Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos in an effort to influence if not silence the Washington Posts reporting on Saudi Arabia It said the allegations reinforced other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities Was Jeff Bezos the weak link in cybersecurity Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack What happened to Jamal Khashoggi The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder saying the Post reporters phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezoss They said there had been a massive clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post The statement also called for rigorous control of the unconstrained marketing sale and use of spyware How did the alleged hack take place The UN experts cited a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos iPhone that assessed with medium to high confidence that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman media caption Mohammed bin Salman is asked Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4s arrival there was a massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data from Mr Bezoss phone The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos personal life Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid the National Enquirer In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of extortion and blackmail after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos his wife of 25 years had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a long period What have the Saudis and Bezos said The Twitter account of the kingdoms US embassy  issued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out the embassy said Mr Bezos has made no response to the UN experts statement but did tweet an image of himself with Khashoggis fiancÃ©e along with the tag Jamal Jamal

too common Analysis by Jane Wakefield BBC News technology reporter A hack such as this was horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone from the GPS locator to the camera to the banking facilities and messaging apps Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and last year  a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealed  that would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files  Phone hacking is says Prof Woodward all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes Socalled stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments But what about the involvement of the Saudi

representatives stress she has only a singledigit percentage indirect interest in the relevant fund and no role in operational or investment decisions Novalpina began funding NSO Group Technologies earlier this year Exemplary job NSO has previously been  accused of selling spyware  called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists But the group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour According to its own website  NSO Group  provides the tools that support official authorities to lawfully address the most dangerous issues in todays world Governments use our products to prevent terrorism break up criminal operations find missing persons and assist search and rescue teams Following an exchange of letters with human rights organisation Amnesty  Novalpina issued a statement  last week announcing a new framework to bring NSO Group in full alignment with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights It continued Novalpina and NSO will do whatever necessary to ensure NSOs technology is used only for its intended lawful purpose  the prevention of harm to our fundamental human rights to life liberty and security from acts of terrorism and serious crime The University of Torontos Citizen Lab monitors digital attacks against civil society and has been tracking the NSO Group for several years In a letter published on Tuesday  Citizen Lab said it had sent multiple letters to Novalpina Capital LLP and NSO Group seeking specific answers regarding a number of concerns including at least 31 reports of abusive targeting These questions remain largely unanswered The Serpentine said it was with a mix of gratitude and regret that the board of trustees of the Serpentine Galleries has accepted the resignation of CEO Yana Peel Since taking on the role in 2016 Yana has done an exemplary job furthering the mission visibility and financial standing of the Serpentine increasing support and donations overseeing groundbreaking exhibitions and expanding the Serpentines programme internationally year over year Peel oversaw programmes from artists such as Grayson Perry and Rose Wylie and commissioned touring exhibitions to Milan Miami Paris Berlin Chicago New York and Hong Kong  Correction 1 April 2020 An earlier version of this article said that Yana Peel was listed on company records as an indirect owner of Novalpina This has been since amended to explain that at the time of publication she owned onethird of a holding company Novalpina Capital Group Ms Peels representatives have explained this means she had no control or involvement in the Novalpina Capital investment fund which acquired a stake in NSO Group Our article has also

Muammar Gaddafi   The past several months have been a turbulent period of violence resulting in a divisive political situation according to Gianluca Eramo of the Libya Herald The author says in addition to local fighting neighbouring countries and regional powers are manoeuvring and steering among Libyan militias to gain access power and control  The international community must urgently develop a concrete political strategy to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people for security dignity and democracy said Eramo  Political discourse that focuses on shared open and fair transitional justice mechanisms can shift attention from the current tendency to look outside the country for political backing and support says Eramo It can therefore also help reduce the risk of external actors fuelling cycles of violence Zimbabwe Little help on Ebola from within   Almost 40 years after Ebola was first identified Africa does not have the capacity to play a pivotal role in fighting the virus argues Brian Sedze of the Standard The continent he says has not invested in research believing some overseas country would do the research instead  The continent seems to be completely outraged at the international community for what they believe is a lethargic reaction to efforts at containing the Ebola epidemic Sedze adds There are also murmurs of disapproval that the US provided 3900 soldiers to help in the fight of Ebola instead of medical personnel The question he asks is how many doctors and nurses did Africa itself provide for this effort The lack of personnel might be explained by the ever present dependency syndrome While the world was doing all this for us Africa was busy spending millions sponsoring tribal conflicts billions of dollars on corruption funding lavish lifestyles of its corrupt leaders siphoning billions of dollars to tax havens and sponsoring warped priorities that only encourage political expedience at the cost of lives of its

link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption Parents are allowed to install spyware on their childrens phones in the US Think your kids being bullied Or sending sexts Or dealing drugs Theres an app for that  In the United States nearly 80 of teenagers own mobile phones About half of those are smartphones  with access to the internet games cameras and social media  That worries many parents And those fears are fuelling a growing number of socalled parent apps  to track what kids are doing online  TeenSafe can work as a personal CIA spy for parents  The company urges parents to tell their children they are being monitored but the app can work covertly and show what kids are posting on social media as well as deleted texts and messages sent via popular apps such as Kik WhatsApp and Snapchat  image copyright Teensafe image caption Teensafe allows parents to monitor their childrens online activity including deleted messages Its absolutely legal for a parent to do this discreetly says TeenSafes chief executive Rawdon Messenger  The real question is Is it justified and those are moral decisions a parent has to make What we believe is that when it comes to protecting your child from these things  privacy is trumped by protection Boundary alerts Mr Messenger says he believes about half the families who use TeenSafe use it to spy on their kids  TeenSafe operates in the United States Canada Australia and New Zealand and is hoping to expand to the UK soon Since it started in 2011 it says it has had 800000 people sign up for the service  image copyright Mamabear image caption Mamabears developers say their service is often used by parents who have just given their child their first smartphone Aside from tracking social media use and texting other parent apps can actually monitor how fast someone is driving or moving in a vehicle as a passenger  MamaBear offers that service and cofounder Robyn Spoto says the app is used to link entire families and send alerts when someone is driving above the speed limit or has ventured outside a predetermined boundary It cannot be used covertly Technology is your righthand man to give you the information that you need so that you can have the right conversation says Ms Spoto  She adds that many families find it reassuring to get push notifications about their childrens whereabouts  Ms Spoto uses MamaBear for her parents and 10yearold son who does not have a phone but uses an iPod Touch  But dont her own parents feel annoyed that their adult daughter gets push notifications every time they speed to work or come home at 0100 from a party Laughing Ms Spoto says theyre used to it  Its not like Im creeping on them she says adding that she likes the assurance of knowing they got home safely Teenagers are typically better at using technology than their parents and apps such as these can create a catandmouse game of kids trying to avoid prying eyes  But the parent apps are prepared  if your child does not call you back or turns the phone off you can disable the phone so it only works to call mum or dad  Stalker apps image copyright Thinkstock Some call them the stalker apps worrying that data gathered by smartphone spyware could be misused by suspicious spouses or mistrustful bosses  And it seems the US authorities share these concerns Last year the FBI arrested a man for distributing an app called StealthGenie which intercepted emails and texts as well as recorded phone calls  image copyright Stealthgenie image caption StealthGenie promoted the fact that it could run on a device without its user being aware Prosecutors highlighted that the software was marketed as being undetectable and suggested it was designed for stalkers and domestic abusers In the first ever criminal conviction of its kind Hammad Akbar  was subsequently fined  500000 Â£332840 after pleading guilty to advertising and selling the app Smartphone monitoring services are however legal to use in the US so long as the software is installed on a device used by either the customers child  who must be under 18 years old employee  so long as the worker has given their consent and been told they are being monitored Several available products highlight their restrictions in their small print even if occasionally they also market their  cheating spousecatching potential  As far as the UK is concerned the use of stalker apps could very easily land you on the wrong side of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable UK laws  commented Vin Bange from the law firm Taylor Wessing Domestic use is treated very differently to surveillance in the workplace  the latter is a complex area which requires close observation of the law and employee consent cannot be seen as a silver bullet When asked if they think their parents are spying on them a random group of teens at a busy shopping centre in Los Angeles thought it was highly unlikely  Parents are too busy they say They trust them  image copyright Thinkstock image caption It is increasingly common for young children to have access to internetconnected devices But when I visited a primary school in Los Angeles where cybersecurity expert Lou Rabon was addressing parents at his sons school many of the parents were open to tracking their kids every move I would chip them like a dog if I could one mother said  Many of the parents there thought they were techsavvy and were shocked to see how easy it was for Mr Rabon to pinpoint their geographic location by the photos they posted on Facebook  he then taught them how to turn off geotagging on their camera phones  They groaned in horror as he showed online messages a predator had posted in a chat room posing as a depressed and lonely 14yearold girl looking for friends  Blind trust Mr Rabon who is in the process of creating a parent app of his own advises parents to use obscure passwords  One mother told the story of her nineyearold son who was taught by an older child on the school bus how to get around parental controls on his phone by using a commonly used password in the family  Within minutes he had Googled the word sex and my nineyearold was on a porn site she told parents at the meeting  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Parents risk children circumventing the surveillance software they install He saw things we hoped he wouldnt see ever or for at least another 10 years  It doesnt bode well for parents trying to instil trust and independence in their children  Mr Rabon says its naive for parents to blindly trust their kids  and he agrees that in many ways its a lousy time to be a teenager  When asked if the next trend would be for teenagers to turn off their phones he says it wouldnt work  the app hes creating would alert a group of parents if the children in a circle of friends all turned off their phones and would pinpoint their geographic location  ie the partys busted  If you want to completely disconnect and raise your children in that world youve got to go to the jungles of the Amazon or something in the world we live in today this pervasive ubiquitous technology is only going to expand he says adding that he doesnt want his sons raised in a bubble but he cant ignore reality  This technology could save lives so I think that its absolutely a great thing to be able to track our kids  Related Topics Spying

image copyright UHRP A document that appears to give the most powerful insight yet into how China determined the fate of hundreds of thousands of Muslims held in a network of internment camps has been seen by the BBC Listing the personal details of more than 3000 individuals from the far western region of Xinjiang it sets out in intricate detail the most intimate aspects of their daily lives The painstaking records  made up of 137 pages of columns and rows  include how often people pray how they dress whom they contact and how their family members behave China denies any wrongdoing saying it is combating terrorism and religious extremism The document is said to have come at considerable personal risk from  the same source inside Xinjiang that leaked a batch of highly sensitive material published last year  One of the worlds leading experts on Chinas policies in Xinjiang Dr Adrian Zenz a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington believes the latest leak is genuine This remarkable document presents the strongest evidence Ive seen to date that Beijing is actively persecuting and punishing normal practices of traditional religious beliefs he says One of the camps mentioned in it the Number Four Training Centre has been identified by Dr Zenz as among those visited by the BBC as part of a tour organised by the Chinese authorities in May last year media caption The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their thoughts transformed Much of the evidence uncovered by the BBC team appears to be corroborated by the new document redacted for publication to protect the privacy of those included in it It contains details of the investigations into 311 main individuals listing their backgrounds religious habits and relationships with many hundreds of relatives neighbours and friends Verdicts written in a final column decide whether those already in internment should remain or be released and whether some of those previously released need to return I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps The leading Uighur geographer who vanished in China It is evidence that appears to directly contradict Chinas claim that the camps are merely schools In an article analysing and verifying the document  Dr Zenz argues that it also offers a far deeper understanding  of the real purpose of the system It allows a glimpse inside the minds of those making the decisions he says laying bare the ideological and administrative micromechanics of the camps Row 598 contains the case of a 38yearold woman with the first name Helchem sent to a reeducation camp for one main reason she was known to have worn a veil some years ago It is just one of a number of cases of arbitrary retrospective punishment Others were interned simply for applying for a passport  proof that even the intention to travel abroad is now seen as a sign of radicalisation in Xinjiang In row 66 a 34yearold man with the first name Memettohti was interned for precisely this reason despite being described as posing no practical risk And then theres the 28yearold man Nurmemet in row 239 put into reeducation for clicking on a weblink and unintentionally landing on a foreign website Again his case notes describe no other issues with his behaviour The 311 main individuals listed are all from Karakax County close to the city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang an area where more than 90 of the population is Uighur Predominantly Muslim the Uighurs are closer in appearance language and culture to the peoples of Central Asia than to Chinas majority ethnicity the Han Chinese In recent decades the influx of millions of Han settlers into Xinjiang has led to rising ethnic tensions and a growing sense of economic exclusion among Uighurs Those grievances have sometimes found expression in sporadic outbreaks of violence fuelling a cycle of increasingly harsh security responses from Beijing  It is for this reason that the Uighurs have become the target  along with Xinjiangs other Muslim minorities like the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz  of the campaign of internment The Karakax List as Dr Zenz calls the document encapsulates the way the Chinese state now views almost any expression of religious belief as a signal of disloyalty To root out that perceived disloyalty he says the state has had to find ways to penetrate deep into Uighur homes and hearts In early 2017 when the internment campaign began in earnest groups of loyal Communist Party workers known as villagebased work teams began to rake through Uighur society with a massive dragnet With each member assigned a number of households they visited befriended and took detailed notes about the religious atmosphere in the homes for example how many Korans they had or whether religious rites were observed The Karakax List appears to be the most substantial evidence of the way this detailed information gathering has been used to sweep people into the camps It reveals for example how China has used the concept of guilt by association to incriminate and detain whole extended family networks in Xinjiang For every main individual the 11th column of the spreadsheet is used to record their family relationships and their social circle Chinas hidden camps The long read Chinas hidden camps Explainer Chinas Muslim crackdown Searching for truth in Chinas reeducation camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign Alongside each relative or friend listed is a note of their own background how often they pray whether theyve been interned whether theyve been abroad In fact the title of the document makes clear that the main individuals listed all have a relative currently living overseas  a category long seen as a key indicator of potential disloyalty leading to almost certain internment Rows 179 315 and 345 contain a series of assessments for a 65yearold man Yusup His record shows two daughters who wore veils and burkas in 2014 and 2015 a son with Islamic political leanings and a family that displays obvious antiHan sentiment His verdict is continued training  one of a number of examples of someone interned not just for their own actions and beliefs but for those of their family The information collected by the village teams is also fed into Xinjiangs big data system called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform IJOP The IJOP contains the regions surveillance and policing records culled from a vast network of cameras and the intrusive mobile spyware every citizen is forced to download The IJOP Dr Zenz suggests can in turn use its AI brain to crossreference these layers of data and send push notifications to the village teams to investigate a particular individual image caption Adrian Zenz has analysed the leaked document The man found unintentionally landing on a foreign website may well have been interned thanks to the IJOP In many cases though there is little need for advanced technology with the vast and vague catchall term untrustworthy appearing multiple times in the document It is listed as the sole reason for the internment of a total of 88 individuals The concept Dr Zenz argues is proof that the system is designed not for those who have committed a crime but for an entire demographic viewed as potentially suspicious  China  says Xinjiang has policies that respect and ensure peoples freedom of religious belief It also insists that what it calls a vocational training programme in Xinjiang is for the purposes of combating terrorism and religious extremism adding only people who have been convicted of crimes involving terrorism or religious extremism are being educated in these centres However many of the cases in the Karakax List give multiple reasons for internment various combinations of religion passport family contacts overseas or simply being untrustworthy The most frequently listed is for violating Chinas strict family planning laws In the eyes of the Chinese authorities it seems having too many children is the clearest sign that Uighurs put their loyalty to culture and tradition above obedience to the secular state China has long defended its actions in Xinjiang as part of an urgent response to the threat of extremism and terrorism The Karakax List does contain some references to those kinds of crimes with at least six entries for preparing practicing or instigating terrorism and two cases of watching illegal videos But the broader focus of those compiling the document appears to be faith itself with more than 100 entries describing the religious atmosphere at home The Karakax List has no stamps or other authenticating marks so at face value it is difficult to verify It is thought to have been passed out of Xinjiang sometime before late June last year along with a number of other sensitive papers They ended up in the hands of an anonymous Uighur exile who passed all of them on except for this one document Only after the first batch was published last year was the Karakax List then forwarded to his conduit another Uighur living in Amsterdam Asiye Abdulaheb She told the BBC that she is certain it is genuine image caption Asiye Abdulaheb decided to speak out despite the danger Regardless of whether there are official stamps on the document or not this is information about real live people she says It is private information about people that wouldnt be made public So there is no way for the Chinese government to claim it is fake Like all Uighurs living overseas Ms Abdulaheb lost contact with her family in Xinjiang when the internment campaign began and shes been unable to contact them since But she says she had no choice but to release the document passing it to a group of international media organisations including the BBC Of course I am worried about the safety of my relatives and friends she says But if everyone keeps silent because they want to protect themselves and their families then we will never prevent these crimes being committed At the end of last year China announced that  everyone in its vocational training centres had now graduated  However it also suggested some may stay open for new students on the basis of their free will Almost 90 of the 311 main individuals in the Karakax List are shown as having already been released or as being due for release on completion of a full year in the camps But Dr Zenz points out that the reeducation camps are just one part of a bigger system of internment much of which remains hidden from the outside world image caption The outside of one of the camps in Xinjiang More than two dozen individuals are listed as recommended for release into industrial park employment  career advice that they may have little choice but to obey There are well documented concerns that China is now building a system of coerced labour as the next phase of its plan to align Uighur life with its own vision of a modern society  In two cases the reeducation ends in the detainees being sent to strike hard detention a reminder that the formal prison system has been cranked into overdrive in recent years Many of the family relationships listed in the document show long prison terms for parents or siblings sometimes for entirely normal religious observances and practices One mans father is shown to have been sentenced to five years for having a doublecoloured thick beard and organising a religious studies group A neighbour is reported to have been given 15 years for online contact with people overseas and another mans younger brother given 10 years for storing treasonable pictures on his phone Whether or not China has closed its reeducation camps in Xinjiang Dr Zenz says the Karakax List tells us something important about the psychology of a system that prevails It reveals the witchhuntlike mindset that has been and continues to dominate social life in the region he said Related Topics Communist Party of China China Xinjiang Uighurs More on this story China separating

page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption The NSO Group boasted about being able to work without a trace What do we know about the curious secretive NSO Group Very little  but after this week an awful lot more than we did before The group an Israelibased but Americanowned company specialises in creating what it calls tools against crime and terrorism But the security researchers call them something else a cyber arms dealer On Thursday the NSO Group was thrust into international headlines after being credited with creating malicious software capable of jailbreaking any iPhone with just one tap of the screen and then installing vicious spyware Factfile NSO Founded in 2010 and has had several different names Based in Herzliya Israel and owned by US investment firm Francisco Partners Could be worth 1bn Securitysavvy human rights lawyer Ahmed Mansoor found himself targeted by the attack when his iPhone received a message promising secrets about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates  Had he tapped on the link the phone would have been plundered Huge amounts of private data text messages photos emails location data even whatâs being picked up by the deviceâs microphone and camera Thankfully he didnt do that Instead he passed on the message to experts at Citizen Lab and Lookout who peeled back the covers on what they described as one of the most sophisticated cyber weapons ever discovered With it came evidence that it was the NSO Groupâs expertise at the heart of it all Big money deals Earlier this year UKbased watchdog Privacy International launched a database tracking the global trade of cyber arms Its intention was to track deals between cyber arms companies and governments According to the Surveillance Industry Index SII the NSO Group was founded in 2010 and is based in Herzliya an attractive city north of Tel Aviv that is known as being a cluster of tech startups The group was likely funded by the elite 8200 Intelligence Unit an Israeli militaryfunded scheme for startups  According to Forbes the  8200 Intelligence Unit was heavily involved  in providing expertise and funding for  Stuxnet  a cyber attack on Iran that was a joint operation between the US and Israel  image copyright AP image caption The texts had been sent to human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor Listed in the SSI were multimillion dollar deals made between the NSO Group and government entities in Mexico and Panama This is the tip of the iceberg  âpress reports of sales rely on leaks and anonymous sources and so there are likely many more unknown to the general public  In 2015 the NSO Groupâs owners  âUSbased venture capital firm Francisco Partnersâ  were looking to sell the company at a value of around 1bn Neither firm has responded to the BBCâs requests for further comment That the NSO Group sells tools to governments is no secretâ  âin a statement released in response to claims it was behind the attack on Mr Mansoor NSO Group spokesman Zamir Dahbash said The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations But the company has gone no further than that in describing who its customers are and what exactly they buy It does say it has no control over how its tools are used and for what purpose Outstanding work Whatever the origin of the NSO Group what has been created is an extraordinarily talented team of cyber specialists The attack on Mr Mansoor had it worked would have utilised not one but three zero day attacks A zero day is a term given to vulnerabilities that were previously unknown to the security industry and are therefore wide open to attack To discover one zero day is rare to find three is outstanding Clues to the origin of the attack came when the experts looked at the messages Mr Mansoor received A link was included to a web domain known to point to servers set up by the NSO Group for its customers When the researchers analysed the spywareâs code they noticed apparent references to Pegasus the name given by the NSO Group to one of its spying products Details about Pegasus were made public last year when another cyber arms firm called the Hacking Team was itself breached Material used to market Pegasus was subsequently leaked  When Apple was made aware of the vulnerabilities in its iPhone it acted quickly patching the problem in 10 days and pushing out an update to all of its users That has neutralised this specific attack sure but therell likely be many more that remain hidden from view  In a rare interview with Defense News the NSO Groupâs cofounder Omri Lavie said their attacks would leave no trace  Thanks to the quick thinking of Mr Mansoor and the forensic efforts of researchers the group has been temporarily dragged into the limelight  but it will only be for a brief moment Soon the NSO Group  will rejoin the rest of the moneyspinning cyber arms trade back in the shadows

link About sharing Related Topics Brexit image copyright Getty Images The markets have not been moved much by Theresa Mays tears because they dont see her resignation changing much or reducing the levels of uncertainty around Brexit  A rift has opened up between Tories and former friends in business Business lobbies are calling ever more forcefully for Westminster to sort out Brexit while avoiding a no deal departure The report card on the May premiership has some changes to economic policy but her fall opens the way for a bigger change on the Conservative approach to immigration When a corporate chief executive quits its sometimes worth a look at the share price A sharp rise suggests that the boss was holding back the company and an exit was overdue a fall indicates that investors saw the bosss presence as an important part of its future So how did the market react to Theresa Mays announcement By doing nothing much The pound weakened 025 against the US dollar The FTSE250 edged up   That is partly because investors had already priced in her departure They could see she wasnt going to cut a deal that got the government through Brexit so assumed she would be resigning before long And with her gone they can also see  as we all can  that theres little alternative route out of the political impasse under any other Conservative prime minister Meanwhile there are other factors at play in the markets which give a better explanation of recent fluctuations including the ramping up of a transPacific trade war between the US and China Treated as dispensable Just ahead of the announcement the latest retail figures were issued by the Office for National Statistics showing  the volume of goods sold up by 52 year on year  The value was flat after a very strong first quarter Add to that an  unemployment rate at a 44year low  and employment at record levels and you can see the economic record while Theresa May was in Downing Street wasnt so bad at all If she had focused on that there might have been a less tearful conclusion to her time in office But the economy was never personally her main interest or strong point It was a factor within the overarching determination to push through Brexit but it was treated as if it were dispensable or an afterthought For some it could be compromised in the endeavour to placate those who saw the return of sovereignty as being of more value than the diminished growth rate which most economists reckon would follow image copyright Getty Images image caption The prime minister visited the Portmeiron factory in StokeonTrent in January In the turmoil within her cabinet it was left to the minority of ministers with economic portfolios to remind colleagues of the potential damage to businesses and the economy Phillip Hammond as chancellor of the exchequer and Greg Clark as business secretary often cut lonely figures in making that case Under Mays leadership a gulf opened up between the Conservatives and big business which has been causing alarm to both sides of that relationship Business lobbies have become increasingly frustrated that the internal Conservative debate about Brexit has been carried on with little reference to their warnings which have been particularly strong about the potential damage of no deal When the CBI directorgeneral visited Edinburgh recently for a lunch with members the guest speaker was due to be Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell He didnt make it to the Scottish capital due to the doomed Brexit talks with the government But the invitation was a sign that the business lobby is turning its attention with quite a lot of alarm to the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour taking power Nothing has changed The common message to all those reacting to the Therexit of Mrs May is that it doesnt change the arithmetic or provide a solution Indeed it prolongs the uncertainty and introduces the risk of a harderline Brexiteer pushing for departure without a deal The Institute of Directors with a gently mocking tone repeats the prime ministers words when she had a botched double launch of her long term care policy during that disastrous election campaign in 2017 Nothing has changed says the IoD boss At least not much A new leader will be faced with the same political challenges and the same economic realities No deal remains a significant and growing concern for businesses and that cannot be wished away whoever is in power When companies and the country need serious considered decisionmaking we have pantomime instead According to Carolyn Fairbairn directorgeneral of the CBI Theresa May leaves office with the respect of business  But her resignation must be now be a catalyst for change she added There can be no plan for Britain without a plan for Brexit  image copyright Getty Images image caption Theresa May addressed the CBI conference in London in November Winner takes all politics is not working Jobs and livelihoods are at stake Business and the country need honesty Nation must be put ahead of party prosperity ahead of politics Compromise and consensus must refind their voice in Parliament A similar message came from Liz Cameron at the Scottish Chambers of Commerce We now urge political leaders to put country before personal ambitions to ensure focus remains on solving the Brexit riddle  Westminster has already squandered far too much time going around in circles They must realise that lack of direction has realworld economic consequences causing the collapse of business confidence which has a deleterious impact on investments and jobs Trade war Some changes to economic policy under Theresa Mays premiership are worth noting She pulled back on George Osbornes focus on the Northern Powerhouse in the north of England An industrial policy was being developed   The government dolloped money into growth sectors where it saw strategic interest But this was submerged by the battle to protect sectors such as carmaking and steel that are particularly vulnerable to Brexit disruption And in recent weeks the need to open trade out beyond the European Union tripped up over the Pacific trade war  image copyright Getty Images image caption A visit to the Jaguar Land Rover factory in Solihull with Chancellor Philip Hammond in 2016 The Downing Street cabinet was split between welcoming Chinese telecoms technology the prime ministers preference and supporting the American case that Huawei carries too much potential as spyware Being a much smaller trading power than the EU and with trade deals to be done expect more similar dilemmas As chancellor Phillip Hammond dialled back on the austerity rhetoric and pushed back his predecessors target date for reaching a surplus  While the Whitehall welfare budget continued to see big cuts the biggest of them through the freeze on workingage benefits the flow of funds to the National Health Service was increased Windrush fiasco And what of the future Apart from the dominant question of Brexit and how to make it happen the next Conservative leader will have the opportunity to reshuffle the cabinet putting different people into the economic ministries and shifting economic policy My hunch is that there wont be enormous change because there isnt the time government headspace or political capital to do much beyond Brexit But one factor to watch is immigration Theresa May has had a stranglehold on immigration policy for nine years since she became home secretary It was on that that she placed her reputation for toughness She gave us the policy of making a hostile environment for those facing deportation meanwhile blundering into the Windrush fiasco of excluding longtime residents of the UK who had been invited 60 years ago from the Caribbean to fill labour market gaps image copyright Getty Images image caption Mrs Mays cabinet included potential leadership contenders Jeremy Hunt Philip Hammond and Sajid Javid Mrs May shut out new thinking about how to handle immigration Behind the Leave majority it played a significant part Even for the six years before that vote her response to public opinion about it was to set an unrealistic target for reducing net migration to below 100000 and then to stick to it while deaf to unintended consequences  for instance on overseas student recruitment The rest of the cabinet has sometimes been infuriated by Mrs Mays intransigence on this when she was home secretary Now in that role Sajid Javid doesnt much care for the sub100000 target In launching a consultation on postBrexit immigration he quietly dropped it That consultation features the question of what salary level should be set for an EU or nonEU national to get a work permit in Britain The proposed level is Â£30000 which business groups say is far too high to recruit the skilled staff they need in more junior roles The next Tory leader and prime minister is likely to want to take a more flexible approach than Theresa May In Scotland such a change would be welcomed across Holyroods political spectrum and by business lobbies Related Topics Theresa May Scotland economy Brexit

spyware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50809562|Tech 2019 Our biggest technology stories By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor Published 31 December 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing As 2019 splutters to a close its time for our annual lookback at our mostread tech stories and to ask What happened next Facebook and its family of apps dominates this years list with four entries  it  probably wont be a surprise that none of them were particularly brandenhancing  The Chinese viral video app TikTok makes the cut for the first time And many of the other big tech names are there too in one form or another But there are a few notable exceptions Neither Elon Musk nor Tesla made it despite the  windowsmashing launch of the Cybertruck  and  plans to hack our brains  Googles cofounders were originally on the list  after deciding to give up daytoday control of their empire  but were squeezed out just before publication Video gaming also missed out even though Prince Harry attracted lots of attention for  suggesting Fortnite should be banned And both Huawei and Samsung are absent even though  the formers loss of Googles apps  and the latters  folding phone fiasco  were two of the years standout developments In any case heres what attracted most eyeballs in each month of the year January When three becomes one image copyright Getty Images A leak forced Facebook to reveal plans to merge the behindthescenes tech of messaging on WhatsApp Messenger and Instagram The effort was reported to be a pet project of chief executive Mark Zuckerberg  He later justified the move saying it  would draw the three products closer together  making it easier for users to send posts between them Furthermore he said it would also help the firm expand its endtoend encryption features which help keep the messages secure  Many observers noted however the action would also make it more difficult to split the company apart And as the year went on that became a growing threat with first Senator Elizabeth Warren and then other Democratic presidential candidates suggesting Facebook has too much power and influence But it may not take a change of administration for Mr Zuckerbergs ambitions to be thwarted The Wall Street Journal recently  reported that the Federal Trade Commission may intervene  to prevent the apps being integrated February Dont be scared Social media the mainstream news and even the police all got in a tizzy over Momo for no good reason in February It was claimed that youngsters social media accounts were being hacked to show the bulgingeyed monster alongside challenges that would put their lives at risk  Online articles followed linking more than 100 teenagers deaths in Russia to the sensation Except of course there was no evidence to back up any of this  This was not even the first time an image of the Japanese birdwoman sculpture had gone viral There had been a similar smallerscale scare in 2018 when the game had been linked to deaths in South America and India  again without any documented proof  Pundits described it as a  panic that wont go away  Except it did  These days a search for Momo on Twitter turns up ads for masks of the ghoul but little else  And on TikTok the hashtag momochallenge surfaces videos of people cooking and eating small dumplings that go by the same name in parts of Asia March Turn it off and on again image copyright Getty Images Facebooks family of apps experienced 14 hours of disruption in what was billed as their most severe outage to date  In many cases users were unable to access the services at all over the period And it took the firm about another 10 hours to give itself the allclear  at which point it tweeted  that a server configuration change had been to blame  That allowed it to deny suggestions that it had been hacked while remaining suitably vague about the actual cause April How did they get in image copyright Getty Images Cybersecurity experts despaired after a study indicated that the most popular online password was 123456  The UKs National Cyber Security Centres finding came with a warning that the string of digits is not only easy to guess but would be one of the first codes tested by automated hacking tools  The public is advised to instead register a  different complex login for each service they join  and use a password manager But the hassle involved in having to copy and paste them in each time has encouraged the adoption of biometric tests that automate the process if users pass a face eyes or fingerprint ID check Another alternative is to log in via another platform and let it do the heavy lifting And in September Apple joined the party when it allowed users to  access thirdparty apps via a new Sign In With Apple button  mirroring earlier efforts by Google Facebook and Twitter May WhatsApp cracked image copyright Getty Images When WhatsApp confirmed that a vulnerability in its app had been exploited to install surveillance software on victims phones one of the immediate questions was how widespread the attack had been  It took until October to get some clarification at which point Facebook said it believed  about 1400 of its users had been directly compromised  It added that they included at least 100 human rights defenders journalists and other members of civil society across at least 20 countries  The tech firm alleges NSO Group an Israeli private security firm is responsible and is currently suing it in the US courts NSO disputes the claim and has said it will vigorously fight the case  Whatever the outcome the affair highlighted that if an attacker can load spyware onto a targets phone or other device endtoend encryption and other security measures may be in vain June The death of Etika image copyright EtikaYouTube Brooklynbased Desmond Etika Amofah had a large online following thanks to his quick wit and Nintendo videogame reaction videos on YouTube and Twitch But in midJune he caused concern when he posted a clip in which he discussed suicide Days later the New York City Police Department confirmed he had killed himself  Several of his friends and colleagues have since taken steps to memorialise him An online store sells goods branded with his logo and donates its profits to the National Alliance on Mental Illness YouTuber PewDiePie also teamed up with actor Jack Black to raise further funds for the charity in Etikas name  Others have marked the tragedy by  getting themed tattoos  A still active Twitter account   Etika   was created to keep his memory alive

BBC Action Line  for more information about support services July Photo glitches image copyright Getty Images Further technical problems at Facebook HQ prevented users being able to upload new photos and videos to its apps and in some cases prevented existing ones being viewable The disruption lasted for about nine hours  Facebook never really explained the cause beyond saying it had been triggered by a maintenance operation Other smaller glitches persisted throughout the year including intermittent outages in the US on Thanksgiving But given that it now  serves more than 24 billion users  who log into at least one of its services once a month it is a considerable feat of engineering to keep everything ticking along August iPhone booby traps image copyright Getty Images Studies indicate that Apples mobile devices  face fewer serious cybersecurity threats  than Androidpowered equivalents So when Google revealed that hackers were using boobytrapped websites to exploit previously unidentified flaws in iOS potentially affecting thousands of visitors per week it was big news  Google  added that compromised handsets  made it possible for the perpetrators to steal private messages photos and location data in realtime For days there was speculation about who might have been exposed Apple  eventually released a statement  saying it believed that fewer than a dozen websites focused on content related to the Uighur community had been affected Many took this to suggest that the Chinese state was involved However Apple did not explicitly draw this conclusion itself which was unsurprising given its ties to the country This was not Apples only Uighurrelated controversy this year The campaign group Sum of Us has repeatedly claimed  that the firms willingness to comply with a Chinese ban on  virtual private network VPN apps has made it harder for civil rights defenders to safely discuss claims of abuses against the ethnic minority The organisation now plans to raise the matter at Apples next annual shareholders meeting  September More cameras media caption WATCH Taking a slowfie with the iPhone 11 The iPhone 11 range got more cameras longerlasting batteries and a new pro moniker for the topoftherange models But there was no 5G  despite Samsung Huawei and other rivals having already launched compatible smartphones And whispers that Apple chief executive Tim Cook might be ready to unveil an augmented reality headset accessory proved to be unfounded  Market watchers have since  reported the iPhones sold better than they expected   particularly in the US and Western Europe And there is now talk of 2020 being the year of an iPhone supercycle thanks to an expected revamped design along with the introduction of 5G October Jedi wars image copyright Getty ImagesReuters Amazon  and many outsiders  thought it had the strongest bid for a highprofile contract to provide the Pentagon with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services So there were shockwaves when Satya Nadellas Microsoft clinched the socalled Jedi deal instead It could be worth as much as 10bn Â£77bn over time Not only was this a big sum to miss out on but Microsofts marketing team should also find it easier to pitch the firms Azure services to other government departments and private companies as a consequence This could put Amazon Web Services current status as the market leader under strain Amazon is challenging the award claiming that President Trump pressured the Department of Defense into rejecting its bid because of a personal vendetta against its chief executive Jeff Bezos All of this could all have ramifications for the 2020 presidential election Regulation of big tech is already on the agenda and Amazon could make a tempting target for Mr Trump during the campaign But if Mr Bezos believes the Republican leaders reelection could threaten his business his status as one of the worlds richest men and the owner of the Washington Post could make him a formidable foe November The eyes have it media caption WATCH Feroza Aziz rejects TikToks explanations for blocking her from its app At the start of the year TikTok was fairly obscure beyond its core teenage audience These days it is one of the most talked about apps It has launched one meme after another and earned a reputation as being one of the most joyous places to be on the internet But there are also concerns about it being Chineseowned Matters came to a head last month when an American teenager posted a video that started off like an eyelash beauty tutorial But creator Feroza Aziz quickly changed tack to criticise Chinas treatment of the Uighurs Her clip went viral Shortly afterwards the 17yearold discovered she had been blocked from posting new material And soon after that TikTok took the clip offline Then the social network reversed course It put back the clip blaming the removal on a human moderation error And it reestablished Ms Azizs access saying that she had been locked out because of unrelated past behaviour  The app  insisted that there had been no attempt to suppress criticism of the Chinese governments actions  but Ms Aziz was not convinced She has continued to flag concern about the Uighurs And in her latest skin care video also raises awareness about Indias controversial citizenship law which offers illegal immigrants from nearby countries amnesty but only if they are nonMuslims  something she claims is immoral For whatever reason the post has attracted far more views on Twitter and Instagram than the copy posted to TikTok Meanwhile TikTok bosses are  reportedly looking for a new global headquarters outside of China  to help reinforce their claims to autonomy But the apps owner Bytedance has  denied rumours that it might sell off the division  to give it true independence December Age of the Splinternet image copyright Sasha Mordovets Its been a long while since the internet was a freeforall in which governments had little ability to restrict what their citizens did online Even so Russias announcement that it had successfully tested what it terms a sovereign internet still felt like a significant moment The initiative involves forcing all web traffic through special nodes  a term for network connection points  where content can be filtered to remove what is deemed to be risky material Furthermore the intention is that in an emergency all data from outside the country could be blocked and the Runet  a term for the Russian internet  isolated The achievement is described in the state media as a way to protect domestic companies and government bodies from cyberattacks But human rights campaigners warn that once the effort is up and running the Kremlin may also use it to limit Russian peoples access to undesirable information In doing so the Russian government would be following the path of its counterparts in China Saudi Arabia and Iran which all censor dissenting voices  And it would be following a wider trend The  USbased Freedom House digital rights group  has warned that global internet freedom declined for a ninth consecutive year in 2019 Beyond Russia it highlighted Kazakhstan Sudan and Brazil as examples of places where digital surveillance targeted cyberattacks andor online disinformation campaigns were cause for concern We should hear more about Russias effort once President Putin has had a chance to examine the results of the tests and decides how to proceed For now a Kremlin spokesman has denied it has any intention of cutting the internet

link About sharing image copyright Reuters image caption Mods for Minecraft are often repackaged to contain all kinds of malicious extras Could your children be your weak link when it comes to home security One of mine almost was thanks to Minecraft One of my boys wanted to install a mod for it and needed me to approve it And as I am paranoid about what runs on our main computer I oversaw the whole process At first it all looked fine  There are thousands of mods or addons for Minecraft that make a variety of changes to the game Some add new blocks others change the way it looks and some turn it into an entirely different game  The one he wanted was hard to find despite it being popular among his friends When we found it I was not sure we were getting it from the person who actually created it I was suspicious because the site was festooned with buttons that looked like they would start the download but instead led to dead ends populated by links to download accelerators and other utilities we did not want Grubby ads blinked alongside Im not sure mature Russian women are keen to meet my 12yearold son Cybersecurity Alert special index Is your phone listening to you How to

such as Neopets have a long history After a few dead ends we clicked the right link but then had to wait while we were put through several redirects and a popup page that could not be shut down if we wanted the mod  We did so we stuck with it and the download started And kept going And going Which was odd given it was only a few megabytes in size My suspicions aroused I killed the download over my sons protests It was just as well Running it through an online malware scanner revealed that though it was not actively malicious it would have installed adware and hijacked searches Definitely not the mod we wanted Big target Soon afterwards I found a warning about the page saying it was fake That warning was circulated by  the Stop Mod Reposts campaign  It is attempting to stop popular mods being hijacked by conmen virus writers and cyberthieves  It maintains a long long list of the scam pages offering repackaged mods It even makes an extension for web browsers that warns when you stray on to a dodgy site Minecraft is a huge target said Chris Boyd a security researcher at Malwarebytes and a veteran scamspotter He has seen fake sites offering the game for free fake pages asking visitors to log in with their Minecraft name and password as well as a variety of other scams offering skins capes and cheats But he said there was a long history of cyberconmen going after children and the things they do online He remembers seeing scams in 1999 that targeted the economy around Neopets  digital creatures popular with younger web users  Staying safe online Keep all software uptodate and patched Use antivirus and antispyware software And a firewall Give your children an account on a PC or laptop that restricts what they can install  Use strong passwords mix letters numbers and symbols and do not share them Not even with friends Be wary of links offered in chat forums or ingame Talk to your children about what is appropriate behaviour  Choose neutral user names Use different login details on different sites Do not reveal personal information even to those who are being friendly Be sceptical of flashy ads and links to games cheats and freebies that offer ingame currencies Check if there is a way to restrict who children play with online Check online privacy settings to see with whom data is being shared Younger gamers are regularly targeted said Mark James of security firm Eset and many inadvertently give away their age with the names they choose when they sign up to a site or service Scammers and conmen can lurk in forums offering advice and links to extras cheats and advice pages that are actually laced with malware  Often ingame chat channels play host to predators waiting for that click on a bad link that infects a device he said There is evidence that lurking on a gaming service pays off for the bad guys Valve which runs the massively popular Steam gaming service revealed late last year that 77000 accounts for the service are being hijacked each month Control of those accounts will be lost via Steams chat system or through boobytrapped links image copyright Thinkstock image caption A flashy advert can entice a child to click where they shouldnt Mr James warned against befriending people on social media just to get freebies for games and said parents needed to educate children about safe browsing and gaming and what information was appropriate to share Without this he said children can be an easy target If they want that mod or addon they will do almost anything to get it he said Unfortunately many young people do not have the perspective to see what longterm damage could be done if they are caught out Statistics from security firm Symantec suggest that younger people are getting hit regularly A report it produced in early 2016 revealed that a quarter of parents have had a child or know someone with a child whose actions compromised the familys online security Jacqueline Beauchere Microsofts chief online safety officer said scammers go to great lengths to catch children out Young people are easily enticed to click flashy advertisements visit unofficial websites of popular celebrities download socalled free games and tap Agree OK or I accept to quickly get to where and what they want to online she said Many of these actions are just notorious pathways to viruses spyware and other malicious software The scammers went after children said Ms Beauchere because of the cache of valuable loot that one mistake might lead them to image copyright Thinkstock image caption Pick passwords that are hard to guess and do not share them around or reuse them Among criminals personal and financial data about any and all individuals has become the soughtafter currency of the web she said Cyberthieves targeted children only to get at this data she said  Mr Boyd from Malwarebtyes agreed And he said what helped the scammers was the way children typically get online  A lot of kids play via their parents tablets laptops and desktops he said Its quite likely that parents will reuse login details on other accounts And theres likely to be a payment method attached to it That is the data they are after he said What makes this tougher to police he said is that children often know more than their parents about the technology That competence can fool many parents into thinking their offspring are safer online than they actually are  I would be surprised if parents know much about how the technology works he said But he added staying safe is not impossible It takes collaboration between parents and children Both need to educate the other about what they do and how to stay safe  Related Topics Cybersecurity Internet Gaming Children More on this story First look at virtual reality Minecraft

goldplated reputation with consumers be dented by an embarrassing security foulup Also on the podcast this week is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional esports player We try to answer those questions on this weeks Tech Tent Apple the root of the problem For a long time Apple has boasted  with some justification  that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders  In any case with PCs having the lions share of the computer market hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this Dear AppleSupport we noticed a HUGE security issue at MacOS High Sierra Anyone can login as root with empty password after clicking on login button several times It sounded unlikely but it was true What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble image copyright Getty Images image caption Apples Tim Cook Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building Prof Angela Sasse from University College London tells Tech Tent Its really bad news  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software such as spyware on your computer And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating systems defences So will it suffer any longterm consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust Neil Mawston from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand  But he has some concerns Were seeing this gradual ticktock of missteps in delivery  Recently we have seen the delay in the launch of Apples Homepod  and another albeit much more minor security issue  If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error Tim Cooks style is very much more measured but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months Bitcoins energy conundrum It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin It started 2017 worth just under 1000 Â£740 but this week it soared past the 10000 mark In the days that followed the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced In the space of three hours its price dropped by more than 2000 only to bounce back a few hours later The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions As banks of computers whir away many of them in China the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater According to one study Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland and will soon surpass Moroccos energy use This does not sound sustainable but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising miners will not care about the electricity bills And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase Playing for high stakes Competitive video gaming or esports is a rapidly growing business Market research firm Newzoo

Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright PA Identity theft is reaching epidemic levels according to a fraud prevention group with people in their 30s the most targeted group ID fraudsters obtain personal information before pretending to be that individual and apply for loans or store cards in their name A total of 89000 cases were recorded in the first six months of the year by UK antifraud organisation Cifas That is a 5 rise on the same period last year and a new record high We have seen identity fraud attempts increase year on year now reaching epidemic levels with identities being stolen at a rate of almost 500 a day said Simon Dukes chief executive of Cifas These frauds are taking place almost exclusively online The vast amounts of personal data that is available either online or through data breaches is only making it easier for the fraudster The curious case of Leah Palmer Unmasking the fraudsters ID theft accounts for more than half of fraud recorded by Cifas a notforprofit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies More than four in five of these crimes were committed online it said with many victims unaware that they had been targeted until they received a random bill or realised their credit rating had slumped This would prevent them getting a loan of their own Fraudsters steal identities by gathering information such as their name and address date of birth and bank account details They get hold of such information by stealing mail hacking computers trawling social media tricking people into giving details or buying data through the dark web Analysis Rory CellanJones technology correspondent I got a worrying insight into how our online activity can leave us open to identity theft when a security company offered to examine my digital footprint  Its 30page report showed that a lot of personal details that might be useful to a criminal were out there on public websites  but if you choose to have an online presence that is quite hard to avoid   Far more worrying was the presence in hidden corners of the web of some of my passwords for various accounts harvested in some of the many hacking attacks on major online firms  Luckily I had already changed those passwords but the security researchers told me that anyone in the Western world who used the internet reasonably often was likely to have their details held in one of these data dumps That information is up for sale on a number of criminal marketplaces  Identity theft is big business and it is thriving on the dark web  media caption ID theft at epdemic levels Victims are more likely to be in their 30s and 40s often because a good deal of information about them has been gathered online The stereotypical image of a fraud victim is someone who is elderly and vulnerable but the over60s are the only age group that has seen cases fall this year compared with the first half of the year according to Cifas The age group which has seen the biggest rise is 21 to 30yearolds This finding was mirrored in separate research by credit checking company Experian It said that since 2014 it was increasingly likely that victims were male aged in their 20s and living in London Cifas said it was important that employers needed to be alert to fraud rather than just consumers There had been a sharp rise in ID fraudsters applying for loans online retail telecoms and insurance products it added For smaller and mediumsized businesses in particular they must focus on educating staff on good cybersecurity behaviours and raise awareness of the social engineering techniques employed by fraudsters Relying solely on new fraud prevention technology is not enough Mr Dukes said Katy Worobec from UK Finance which represents the banking industry said Tackling fraud and financial crime is a top priority for the industry Banks have sophisticated controls in place to safeguard the financial system from fraudsters and work closely with enforcement agencies and government to identify and disrupt criminal activity One victims story Anil Sharma found out the hard way that fraudsters had enough information about him to obtain new smartphones in his name Not one but two mobile phone contracts taken out through a wellknown high street retailer were posted to his Liverpool home  He says the chain was quite dismissive of his plight and he was forced to contact the mobile networks to resolve the situation One was more helpful than the other Mr Sharma says but ultimately both accepted that the contracts were taken out fraudulently and cancelled them As well as taking a good deal of phone bashing to resolve the identity theft was also stressful  and affected his credit score as well Its very very worrying But how did the fraudsters obtain his details Initially Mr Sharma thought it was the result of losing his wallet a couple of years ago but Action Fraud says an online breach is the more likely culprit  How to protect yourself from identity crimes Limit the amount of personal information you give away on social networking sites Your real friends know where you live and know your birthday Update your

About sharing image caption Diep Saeeda has been a human rights activist for 25 years In December 2016 Diep Saeeda an outspoken human rights activist from the Pakistani city of Lahore received a short message on Facebook from someone she didnt know but with whom she had a number of friends in common Hy dear She didnt think much of it and never got round to replying But the messages werent coming from a fan of Mrs Saeedas activism  instead they were the start of a sustained campaign of digital attacks attempting to install malware on her computer and mobile phone to spy on her and steal her data  Over the next year she received multiple messages from the same Facebook account apparently run by a young woman calling herself Sana Halimi claiming to work for the United Nations  Glossary Malware patches and worms Pakistan Where reporters face beatings threats and death However the attackers targeting Mrs Saeeda made crucial  mistakes that allowed researchers from human rights group Amnesty International to trace a number of individuals  linked either to the operation or to the malware used  They include a BritishPakistani cyber security expert running a company he claims to be based in Wales and another who used to work for the Pakistani armys public relations wing  Mrs Saeeda is clear whom she believes is ultimately responsible for the attacks Im convinced these are intelligence agencies They try to harass people and force them to leave the country  image copyright Diep Saeeda image caption Mrs Saeeda was contacted by Sana Halimi a year before the account began sending her malware She says in the past they targeted her for promoting dialogue between ordinary Pakistanis and Indians  There was a time they would visit my home or office on a daily basis When I get up in the morning there would be two people outside my home  But she says the malware attacks were more invasive than anything she had previously experienced  Crackdown fears Amnesty International has spoken to three other Pakistan human rights activists who have been targeted in the same way They discovered that the main piece of malware being used had also been used in previously documented attacks on Indian military and diplomatic officials  Amnesty International say they have no evidence of Pakistani state involvement and are unable to say who is ultimately responsible for conducting the attacks Sherif ElsayedAli director of global issues at Amnesty told the BBC they were calling on the Pakistani authorities to investigate the attacks as a matter of urgencyâ¦ and to ensure that human rights defenders are adequately protected both online and offline  Human rights groups have repeatedly warned that the Pakistani intelligence services appear to be cracking down on activists who criticize them  In January 2017 a group of bloggers went missing for a number of weeks before being released  Two subsequently told the BBC that they had been detained by the security services and tortured  An activist vanishes A year after first establishing contact with Mrs Saeeda Sana Halimi sent her the first messages with malware attached  Mrs Saeeda was at the time in a state of panic One of her closest friends fellow activist Raza Khan had disappeared The 40yearold who worked on promoting better relations between Pakistan and India had been attending a talk on extremism on 2 December 2017 He hasnt been seen since leaving the event The next day friends found his door locked and light on  his computer missing They believe he was taken into custody by the intelligence services  Activist says Pakistan tortured him Pakistani blogger says he was tortured  A few days after Mr Khans disappearance as Mrs Saeeda was becoming increasingly vocal in the media she received her first malware attack Sana Halimi sent her a fake Facebook login page via Facebook Messenger Had she clicked on it the site wouldve recorded her Facebook password  She didnt though and a few weeks later received another malware attack again from Sana Halimi This time the message contained a link  apparently to a set of News Years Evethemed photo filters  In fact it was malware designed to hack into her mobile phone and intercept text messages  Again Mrs Saeeda didnt click on the link The attackers changed tactics  Sana Halimi messaged Mrs Saeeda telling her she needed to talk to her privately about the disappearance of her friend Mr Khan  Mrs Saeeda desperate for anything that could help locate Mr Khan became suddenly interested  image copyright Diep Saeeda The messages continued for over two weeks and culminated in a message from Sana Halimi purportedly containing an attached document that would help her understand what had happened to Mr Khan   Mrs Saeeda attempted to download it but it was blocked by her computers antivirus software The document appeared to be another piece of malware  Over the subsequent weeks and months Mrs Saeeda was repeatedly targeted in further attacks this time over email One email she received claimed to be from the office of the chief minister of Punjab the province she lived in It said the chief minister would be visiting her office to discuss the case of her still missing friend Mr Khan By this time though Mrs Saeeda was aware she was being targeted and forwarded the emails to Amnesty International instead of downloading the files  image copyright Diep Saeeda They discovered Mrs Saeeda had been sent at least two different pieces of malware one by Facebook and one by email  The malware attached to the email could amongst other things log passwords take pictures from the webcam activate and record audio from the microphone steal files from the hard disk They identified this malware as a software called Crimson  Crimson attacks have been documented before A number of cyber security firms wrote about the malware in March 2016 after discovering it was being used to target Indian military and diplomatic figures    Claudio Guarnieri from Amnesty told the BBC the Crimson malware used to target Mrs Saeeda was almost identical to that used in the past   An independent cyber security firm told the BBC it was highly confident the attacks documented by Amnesty had been carried out by the same group behind the attacks on Indian targets  Digital spy services Amnesty was able to use the malware they examined to identify some of those associated with creating it  They discovered the malware linked to the New Years Eve photo filters that Sana Halimi had sent to Mrs Saeeda via Facebook would send any stolen data to a server registered in Lahore The owner of the server was a man called Faisal Hanif whose email address and phone number were listed in the server details  image copyright Getty Images image caption The disappearance of the bloggers last year prompted a number of protests These linked to a Facebook profile revealing that Mr Hanif owned a company called Super Innovative On its website Super Innovative advertises digital spy services which allow you to monitor calls text messages and emails of your children company employees or loved ones whilst remaining unnoticeable  The company website claims to be based in Penarth Wales  When the BBC visited the property a woman living at the address admitted knowing Mr Hanif and told the BBC he did occasionally visit from Pakistan But she said she knew nothing about the company Super Innovative  Mr Guarnieri says there is no evidence Mr Hanif or Super Innovative were involved in sending the malware to Mrs Saeeda but his research connects Mr Hanif to the creation of the malware used to target her  What we believe is that they were the ones tasked to create these tools but not necessarily the ones that used it When contacted by the BBC Mr Hanif denied involvement in the attacks on Mrs Saeeda  He said he believed he had been hacked  and his details falsely used to register the server linked to the malware He denied having created any spyware that could be used to steal mobile phone data Shortly after the BBC contacted Mr Hanif the server linked to the attacks was taken down  No more email attachments In researching the creators of a previous version of the Crimson malware the Amnesty team came across a massive lapse in security by those linked to it A folder containing as yet unreleased copies of the malware was left publicly accessible Mr Guarnieri told the BBC it was a pretty common mistake for those working in the field to make   As well as copies of the malware they found a word document that appeared to be an outline of an online team dedicated to targeting perceived opponents of the Pakistani army  The document states that part of their role consists of checking different websites to see if there are any antiarmy content on it so we try to take them down or at least trace the administratorsâ¦ We are working on different target accounts to trace their IP addresses or to compromise their accounts  By establishing the email address associated with the metadata of the document Amnesty researchers traced it to an Islamabadbased cyber security expert Zahid Abbasi  When confronted by the BBC Mr Abbasi confirmed he had previously worked for a year for the Pakistani militarys public relations team ISPR and that the document was genuine  He admitted his role included tracing the IP addresses of people abusing institutions online and compromising their accounts by for example sending them fake Facebook login pages  However he denied that human rights activists were amongst those targeted or that he had any connection to the Crimson malware  There is no evidence that Mr Abbasi was involved in the attacks on Mrs Saeeda  There was no immediate response to the BBCs request for comment from the Pakistani army Mrs Saeeda told the BBC After these attacks I feel insecure  even my own children sending me an email Im scared someone is using their name I dont open emails with attachments  She added tearfully The people who are doing it are spending their resources and their energy on a person who has given 25 years in peace activism Related Topics Internet safety Facebook Internet privacy

Copy link About sharing image copyright Justin Merriman image caption Luis von Ahn was born and raised in Guatemala The BBCs weekly The Boss series profiles different business leaders from around the world This week we speak to Luis von Ahn cofounder and chief executive of language learning app Duolingo If anyone ever doubts the positive impact of immigration tell them about Luis von Ahn A 41yearold from the Central American nation of Guatemala he went to the US in 1996 aged 18 to do a maths degree at Duke University in North Carolina After that he studied computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh Luis went on to become a computer science professor specialising in humanbased computation which in very simple terms is how humans and computers can best work together to solve complicated tasks For his pioneering work in that field he was awarded the USs prestigious  MacArthur Fellows Program award  This is colloquially known as the genius grant because you are said to have to be one to get it image copyright Luis von Ahn image caption Luis first got interested in computers at the age of eight Luis then became a multimillionaire by his early 30s after selling not one but two businesses to Google The technology he sold to the search engine giant is still used by all of us as will be explained later Fast forward to today and Luis is the cofounder and boss of Pittsburghbased Duolingo the worlds most popular languagelearning app which has more than 300 million users around the globe  Softspoken and bespectacled Luis modestly says that the much of his success is down to the fact that he was lucky enough to be taught English as a child A native Spanish speaker he says that his doctor mother insisted that he learned English from a very young age His middle class family then had enough money to send him to a private English language school in the capital Guatemala City  Luis says this obviously put him in a very privileged position compared to most Guatemalans  almost half of the countrys population live in poverty  according to the World Bank  with 9 in extreme poverty Many have limited access to education image copyright Duolingo image caption Duolingo users have to answer a series of questions The inspiration behind Duolingo was to create a language learning app that was free for people to use  be it in Guatemala or around the world  so that they could gain the economic advantages that often come with being at least partially bilingual I wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone says Luis And then I focused on languages because growing up in Guatemala I saw that everyone wants to learn English And knowledge of English in a nonEnglish speaking country can usually mean that your income potential is doubled I mean you literally make twice as much money if you know English So thats kind of where the idea came from to have a free way to learn languages and that was Duolingo Luis and cofounder Severin Hacker started work on the app in 2009 At the time Luis was a professor at Carnegie Mellon and Severin was one of his students Bringing on board linguistics and language retention experts Duolingo launched in 2012 initially offering a handful of languages including English French and Spanish When we launched I was lucky enough to be able to give a TED Talk that was watched by two million people so that gave Duolingo a good initial base of users says Luis But from then until 2019 our growth was solely due to positive word of mouth we didnt do any advertising or marketing at all image copyright Duolingo image caption The companys headquarters is in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania Today Duolingo offers more than 100 courses across 28 different languages While the most popular languages are English Spanish and French you can study everything from Arabic to Ukrainian Duolingo also has a special focus on promoting minority languages with courses in Welsh Navajo Gaelic and Hawaiian Dr Sylvia Warnecke a senior lecturer in languages at The Open University in Scotland says that she was very pleased to see Duolingo work with leading Gaelic speakers to launch that course last year Duolingo gets criticism from some that you cannot learn enough to be come proficient in a language but it is a wonderful way of getting people started she says For lots of people learning a language is a slog and they dont have the time to sign to sign up for formal classes on a weekly basis Apps like Duolingo are a valuable alternative Duolingo now has annual revenues of 90m Â£69m Some 15m of this comes from the adverts included on the free standard app while 75m is from the 2 of users who pay for the advertisementfree premium version image caption Luis was inspired by the idea of being able to help people in Guatemala and other countries learn English or another second language for free If you use Duolingo heavily and you are relatively wealthy then you should pay us that is my sense says Luis But if you are in a developing country and dont have very much money then the free version is for you Thats how I feel about it Now with 200 employees Luis hopes that Duolingo can float on the stock market in 2021 He is said to have a substantial but minority stake in the business which already has some outside investors More  The Boss  features Dan Aykroyd From battling spirits to selling them The billionaire retailer whose shops had no stock The entrepreneur stopping food waste Fashion industrys pollution made me cry Going back in time the two businesses Luis sold to Google were the ESP Game and Recaptcha ESP which stands for Extra Sensory Perception was an online game in which two people who could not communicate with each other had to pick words to describe a photograph When they used the same word they each got a point and were presented with another photo Since 2006 Google has used this technology to improve its image search software image copyright Duolingo image caption Former US President Barack Obama is a fan of Luis and his company Meanwhile Recaptcha is the now widely used system whereby a Googlelinked website asks you to type out words that are written in squiggly handwriting as a means of proving that you are not a socalled bot or malicious software An estimated 200 million people have to do this every day and Luis invented it Recaptcha which was solely owned by Luis was bought by Google in 2009 for an undisclosed eightfigure sum What is little known is that the words you have to write out are not chosen at random Instead they are words from old physical books that Google is digitising and its software is struggling to decipher So every time you do one of those security tests you are an unpaid Google worker If say

image caption Twitter has been under pressure to block bot accounts used to spread disinformation The hashtag TwitterLockout has trended after an apparent purge of suspected malicious bots on the social network Dozens of users report having had their accounts suspended until they provided a telephone number which they then had to verify to prove they were real Some members have raised concerns about their amount of lost followers and claimed discrimination against rightwing political beliefs Others have in turn mocked allegations of bias Twitters tools are apolitical and we enforce our rules without political bias the social network has said in response Every day we proactively look for suspicious account behaviours that indicate inorganic or automated activity violations of our policies around having multiple accounts or abuse  And every day we take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service including by asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it  This is part of our ongoing comprehensive efforts to make Twitter safer and healthier for everyone The firm allows  automated software to be used to send tweets  under some circumstances but forbids the posted content from being misleading It has also  issued new guidance  about the use of automation and having multiple accounts The action follows an indictment announced last week by special counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian firms They are alleged to have used fake accounts on Twitter  and other social media platforms  to conduct information warfare against the United States Twitter and Facebook had faced criticism from US lawmakers earlier in the year for not having taken the problem seriously enough Junk news One researcher who has studied digital disinformation campaigns said a Twitter crackdown should come as no surprise This is a company thats under a lot of heat to clean up its act in terms

sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic media caption WATCH Police raid the home of a vaccinetext fraudster More than 6000 cases of Covidrelated fraud and cybercrime have been recorded by the UKs police forces during the pandemic The Action Fraud team said Â£345m had been stolen since 1 March 2020 It covers activity in England Wales and Northern Ireland but not Scotland In a related development the National Cyber Security Centre has told the BBC it is tackling about 30 significant attacks a month against the countrys pandemic response infrastructure These involves attempts to breach the NHS vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains among other organisations There unfortunately have been a number of successful ransomware incidents against businesses  I can think of roughly around 10 NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said image caption This is one of the scripts used to con victims to believe they were talking to their bank Twin peaks Other figures disclosed by City of London Police which coordinates efforts to combat fraud include more than 150 related arrests were made since the pandemic began more than 2000 websites phone numbers and email addresses linked to the crimes were taken down there was a total of 416000 reports of fraud and cybercrime  The activity peaked between April and May 2020 and January 2021  both times when lockdowns were in force The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit which tackles criminal gangs responsible for financial fraud and scams worked with social media platforms to take down over 700 accounts linked to fraudulent activity in 2020 of which over 250 were money mule recruiters But this may be the tip of the iceberg The National Crime Agency estimates that just one in five fraud cases are typically reported to the police  And the volunteerrun Cyber Helpline told the BBC only a quarter of those who had contacted it after a cyberattack said they had also reported the incident to the police Bank loan scam Many of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping Related fraud was 42 higher over the pandemic than the preceding year as criminals took advantage of the fact many physical stores had been forced to close Anna  not her real name  from Cheltenham was one of thousands of people who received an SMS message asking her to go online and rearrange a parcel delivery  She filled in her details but later suspected something was wrong She alerted her bank and cancelled her bank card image caption Anna came close to being thousands of pounds out of pocket I thought now I have nothing to worry about everything is fine and case closed she told the BBC But the criminals used the details they had already obtained to authorise her bank to credit her account with a Â£9000 loan And a short while later they called her pretending to be the bank  Not realising the scam Anna told them she had not taken out a loan  They gave me the sort code and bank account number I needed to pay back the loan and said if I paid the Â£9000 there wouldnt be any charges But then I was still feeling suspicious so I Googled the sort code and it came up with a completely different bank So Anna called her bank directly and realised the scammers had returned  I didnt lose any money but it did feel like a real burglary to be honest she said  She closed her account and changed her email address and mobile number But she still does not feel safe  Email attack Charities are also common targets  One in three charities suffered a cyberattack during the first 10 months of the pandemic according to Ecclesiastical Insurance One victim actually specialises in offering cybersecurity advice to others Hackers got inside Charity Digitals network for seven days without being detected They compromised its email accounts and sent false invoices to clients The organisations chief executive Jonathan Chevallier told the BBC the breach had not been noticed in part because all his staff had been working from home Charity Digital spent more than Â£10000 investigating the attack and has produced an online webinar to help others avoid a similar fate Fake tech support Another popular type of cyberfraud involved romance scams in which people looking for relationships via the net often get fooled into sending money to prospective partners who prey on their emotions This type of crime was 20 more common over the past year than the one before image caption Fraudsters sometimes use Sim farms to send texts  this unit holds eight cards to quickly send multiple messages at once City of London Police also said key workers had also been specifically targeted In one case a man was arrested on suspicion of using social media to advertise bogus car insurance policies to NHS workers The pandemic appears however to have coincided with a fall in one type of cybercrime Reported cases of computer software service fraud

close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption The University of York is one of those institutions affected At least 10 universities in the UK US and Canada have had data stolen about students andor alumni after hackers attacked a cloud computing provider Human Rights Watch and the childrens mental health charity Young Minds have also confirmed they were affected The hack targeted Blackbaud one of the worlds largest providers of education administration fundraising and financial management software The USbased companys systems were hacked in May It has been criticised for not disclosing this externally until July and for having paid the hackers an undisclosed ransom In some cases the data was limited to that of former students who had been asked to financially support the establishments they had graduated from But in others it extended to staff existing students and other supporters The institutions the BBC has confirmed have been affected are University of York Oxford Brookes University Loughborough University University of Leeds University of London University of Reading University College Oxford Ambrose University in Alberta Canada Human Rights Watch Young Minds Rhode Island School of Design in the US University of Exeter All the institutions are sending letters and emails apologising to those on the compromised databases In some cases the stolen data included phone numbers donation history and events attended Credit card and other payment details do not appear to have been exposed Blackbaud whose headquarters are based in South Carolina declined to provide a complete lists of those impacted saying it wanted to respect the privacy of our customers The majority of our customers were not part of this incident the company claimed It referred the  BBC to a statement on its website  In May of 2020 we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack Prior to our locking the cybercriminal out the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our selfhosted environment The statement goes on to say Blackbaud paid the ransom demand Doing so is not illegal but goes against the advice of numerous law enforcement agencies including the FBI NCA and Europol  Blackbaud added that it had been given confirmation that the copy of data they removed had been destroyed Several Blackbaud clients listed on its site have confirmed they were not affected including University College London Queens University Belfast University of the West of Scotland Islamic Relief Prevent Breast Cancer My main concern is how reassuring  impossibly so in my opinion  Blackbaud were to the university about what the hackers have obtained commented Rhys Morgan a cybersecurity specialist and former student at Oxford Brookes University whose data was involved  They told my university that there is no reason to believe that the stolen data was or will be misused  I cant feel reassured by this at all How can they possibly know what the attackers will do with that information image copyright Getty Images image caption Oxford Brookes University is among those contacting students about the hack Blackbaud has said it is working with law enforcement and third party investigators to monitor whether or not the data is being circulated or sold on the dark web for example Barrister blogger Matthew Scott was also sent an email about the hack I doubt that my university has many details that arent pretty easily available but I am more concerned about giving in to the blackmail and blithely accepting the word of the blackmailer that all the data has now been destroyed he told the BBC Privacy law Under General Data Protection Regulation GDPR companies must report a significant breach to data authorities within 72 hours of learning of an incident  or face potential fines  The UKs Information Commissioners Office ICO as well as the Canadian data authorities were informed about the breach last weekend  weeks after Blackbaud discovered the hack An ICO spokeswoman said Blackbaud has reported an incident affecting multiple data controllers to the ICO We will be making enquiries to both Blackbaud and the respective controllers and encourage all affected controllers to evaluate whether they need to report the incident to the ICO individually Leeds University said in a statement We want to reassure our alumni that since being informed by Blackbaud of this incident we have been working tirelessly to investigate what has happened in order to accurately inform those affected No action is required by our alumni community at this time although as ever we recommend that everyone remains vigilant Related Topics University of York Cybersecurity University of Leeds University of Reading More on this story Hackers

Images image caption Staff at Baltimore City Hall have been unable to send or receive emails Politicians representing a US city struck by a ransomware attack are asking questions of the National Security Agency after claims it helped make the breach possible The New York Times reported on Saturday that a hacking vulnerability known as EternalBlue has been exploited to blackmail Baltimores local government The NSA discovered the flaw but the paper claims that its cyberspies kept the discovery secret for years The NSA declined to comment But the report has particular resonance as the organisation is headquartered at Fort Meade Maryland which is a short drive from Baltimore We dont have anything for you on this an NSA spokesman told the BBC The EternalBlue flaw has been implicated in a range of cyberattacks over the past three years including the WannaCry assault that disrupted the UKs NHS It involves a bug in old versions of  Microsofts Windows operating system  that allows other malicious code to be run on infected computers The NSA reportedly created a tool to do this which it also called EternalBlue Ethical hackers take bugs to the bank Google thwarts Baltimore ransomware fightback Baltimore government held hostage by hackers ransomware The New York Times said the agency did not disclose the problem to Microsoft for more than five years until a breach forced its hand Microsoft released a fix for EternalBlue flaw in March 2017 Weeks later a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers  leaked the NSAs related hacking tool online  The NSA has never confirmed how it came to lose control of its code nor officially commented on the affair But the suggestion is that if it had shared its findings with Microsoft at an earlier stage fewer PCs would have been exposed to subsequent attacks that made use of the vulnerability Email lockout Thousands of Baltimores city government computers were frozen on 7 May after their files became digitally scrambled The criminals responsible demanded 13 Bitcoin 114440 Â£90200 to unlock them all or three Bitcoin to release specific systems ahead of a deadline which has now passed The authorities refused image copyright City of

as a consequence In addition staff have been unable to send or receive emails from their normal accounts Senator Chris Van Hollen and Congressman Dutch Ruppersberger have told the Baltimore Sun newspaper that they are now seeking a full briefing directly from the NSA We must ensure that the tools developed by our agencies do not make their way into the hands of bad actors the senator told the paper Some security experts say if EternalBlue is truly involved then IT managers should have installed a patch long ago Eternalblue was released over two years ago If an organization has substantial numbers of Windows machines that have gone 2 years without patches then thats squarely the fault of the organization not Eternalblue — Robáµáµáµáµ Graham ErrataRob  May 25 2019   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites View original tweet on Twitter But one consultant noted that this may have been easier said than done For some organisations patching can be a nontrivial exercise even with a couple of years of lead time said Troy Hunt Specialised systems such as medical devices for example often go unpatched for long periods of time Offsetting that risk are factors such as the devices not being internetconnected although given were still seeing infections due to EternalBlue two years after it was patched evidently there are still systems out there both unpatched and exposed On the ground in Baltimore Its not exactly the talk of the town here  after all its not like Facebook has gone down merely crucial public services  For those who have been affected its very frustrating  a delayed house sale here a new business that cant open on schedule there One person told me about how they have been unable to pay for their wedding venue at a place partowned by the city  Another told me they couldnt go online to pay a parking ticket  thats not as fortunate as it sounds trust me  A further kick in the teeth for this city is the suggestion that this attack used an exploit discovered not by the Russians or Chinese but by an organisation based just 20 miles away  the US National Security Agency  City officials want answers on that but locals

2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images Covid19 catapulted the health sector to the forefront of cybersecurity in 2020 but the next year is likely to see the dangers continue and evolve  Threats from nation states and criminals to the health system are a growing concern The huge logistical challenge of rolling out vaccines faces the risk of disruption to complex supply chains And criminal ransomware poses a threat at a time when the pandemic has increased our reliance on technology Supply chain The distribution of the various coronavirus vaccines may bring relief but it also brings with it a major challenge many of those involved have not had to think hard about security in the past The complex global supply chain for vaccines ranges from factories in one country to internetconnected fridges in another  It will create new pressure on doctors surgeries IT systems and sometimes small providers who play a critical role  IBM has already said it has seen  suspected statehackers target the cold chain  used to keep supplies at the right temperature during transportation And in the UK the National Cyber Security Centre which worked quickly when the pandemic began to secure vaccine research has since pivoted its efforts towards vaccine distribution  At least the large pharmaceutical companies are no stranger to cyberespionage Their security officials say they first began thinking hard about the issue after a major espionage campaign back in Spring 2010  But the issues around the pandemic have changed the sectors importance  We are now on a grander stage is how one person involved puts it In July the UK accused Russian intelligence of targeting research including for the Oxford vaccine while the US accused Chinese hackers of similar activity The emergence of vaccine nationalism led intelligence and security officials to raise questions about whether countries could try and undermine the efforts of others going forward  It could be trying to steal the intellectual property for financial purposes Tonya Ugoretz of the FBI told a recent Aspen Institute Cyber Summit It could be to undermine confidence or to advantage another countrys own development We see our most determined nationstate adversaries not just relying on one method to target the supply chain but combining cyber with using more traditional espionage and human sources  One much discussed tactic is the deliberate spread of misinformation online about vaccinations or questioning a countrys safety and testing record  The UK Armys 77th Brigade has supported a Cabinet Office investigation into whether foreign states are driving antivaccine fears within the UK  Most sentiment was domestically generated head of Strategic Command General Sir Patrick Sanders said at a recent Chatham House event image copyright Getty Images image caption General Sir Patrick Sanders is the head of Strategic Command which helps manage joint force operations And he raised the possibility of retaliation Where these things are being fuelled from overseas then we will take action and if the NCF National Cyber Force has a part to play in that it will Cyberblackmail campaigns But despite concerns about states experts say criminal ransomware  the locking of people out of their computers and data until they pay  remains the more serious and persistent threat    There was some talk at the start of pandemic from criminal gangs that they would not target health But it did not last and attacks have multiplied  A recent report from security firm Positive Technologies says half of all the cyberattacks on healthcare were ransomware in the JulytoSeptember quarter of 2020 US hospitals have been worse hit than the UK It is thought this is because criminals see them as richer than their NHS counterparts In just 24 hours in October six American hospitals received ransom demands of at least 1m Â£810000 leading to some cancer treatments being cancelled  image copyright EPA image caption Ransomware gangs often take a copy of the data they leave scrambled on their targets computers The healthcare sector has become such a big rich juicy target Greg Garcia executive director for the US Cybersecurity of the Health Sector Coordinating Council recently said Its as if they moved on from the financial services sector Dont weaponise the net warns former cyberchief UK cyberthreat agency confronts Covid19 attacks The UK has made stride to fix weaknesses in the NHS systems exposed by 2017s Wannacry ransomware attack Even so there are concerns it could be hit again Dr Saif Abed has long warned that such an attack could kill a patient He is a former NHS doctor who left clinical practice to set up the AbedGraham group which advises on IT security risks to health The thing thats really concerning is that attackers now understand the concept of clinical urgency he says  They understand If we create a risk that disrupts the ability to provide patient care were more likely to get a payout His worry is that the pandemic has accelerated the digitisation of health While that has brought benefits such as consultations taking place online he says the investment needed to keep internetconnected systems and devices secure has not kept pace Dr Abed says he often hears security researchers talk about hacking insulin pumps to kill someone  But he says a bigger risk is the fact that more devices are being connected together while remaining vulnerable leading to the risk of a cascade effect He adds that his biggest worry is that criminals move from just locking organisations out of their health data to starting to tamper with it posing risks to patient safety The desire to limit further Covid19 outbreaks may also create a further drive to share data more broadly  And that in turn may present further opportunities to steal or subvert it Another sign that the cybersecurity of health is likely to be on the front line in

About sharing image copyright Norsk Hydro image caption Aluminium maker Norsk Hydro refused to pay ransomware hackers  many others pay up When malicious hackers disable your business and demand a ransom should you pay up Many firms do out of desperation turning to intermediaries to help broker the deal But law enforcement says this just makes things worse Imagine the excitement when hackers gained a foothold in the computer system of Norsk Hydro a global aluminium producer  We dont know when it was but its likely that once inside they spent weeks exploring this groups IT systems probing for more weaknesses When they eventually launched their ransomware attack it was devastating  22000 computers were hit across 170 different sites in 40 different countries  Huge aluminium plants hit by cyberattack Chief information officer Jo De Vliegher reopens the ransom note that appeared on computers all over the company It read Your files have been encrypted with the strongest military algorithms without our special decoder it is impossible to restore the data media caption Watch The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers The entire workforce  35000 people  had to resort to pen and paper  Production lines shaping molten metal were switched to manual functions in some cases longretired workers came back in to help colleagues run things the old fashioned way  In many cases though production lines simply had to stop Imagine the hackers anticipation as they waited to receive a reply to their ransom note After all every minute counts for a modern manufacturing powerhouse They probably thought they could name their price But the reply never came The hackers were never even asked how much money they wanted Imagine the shock  All that work For nothing media caption Technology explained what is ransomware Its been more than three months since Norsk Hydro was attacked and they are still many months away from making a full recovery Its so far cost them more than Â£45m But what theyve lost in productivity and revenue theyve arguably gained in reputation  The companys response is being described as the gold standard by law enforcement organisations and the information security industry Not only did they refuse to pay the hackers but theyve also been completely open and transparent with the outside world about what happened to them  But there are many other companies and organisations who make the opposite choice and evidence is growing that ransomware hackers are increasingly being paid off secretly by victims  and their insurance companies  looking for the easy way out  Its become a simple business case for many organisations to pay and at this point its a known secret that this is happening says Josh Zelonis cybersecurity analyst at Forrester  image copyright Getty Images image caption A ransomware attack can cause huge damage to a companys operations Secrecy surrounds the practice because organisations are concerned about the possibility of litigation and the damage to their reputations following an attack says Mr Zelonis  And a lot of the time incident response companies are being brought in to broker the transaction with the adversaries themselves in order to ensure that the payment is made and recovery is possible he says Sources in the information security industry have described multiple occasions when large wellknown companies have paid out thousands of pounds  in some cases hundreds of thousands  to hackers and not told the public or even shareholders  More Technology of Business Why the age of electric flight is finally upon us How a struggling airline went soaring through the cloud The supertough drones and robots going where we cant How to cope with email overload How fish and shrimps could be recruited as underwater spies Just last week  a Florida town paid hackers 600000 Â£475000  to get its computers working again after a ransomware attack disabled email hit emergency response systems and forced staff to use paperbased admin systems Its a troubling trend thats prompted Europol the European Unions law enforcement agency to reissue its warning that paying ransoms fuels hackers and often leads to more organised crime One USbased company Coveware specialises in negotiating ransoms between hackers and their victims Visiting its offices in Connecticut its clear it operates at the sharp end of cybercrime  There is no permanent office instead people move around shared workspaces The entire team is dispersed around the world  image caption Covewares Bill Siegel says ransomware attacks can destroy a company Chief executive and founder Bill Siegel admits that the service is an unpalatable one but insists that it is needed He wouldnt give details on the companies that hes helped but says At any one time we have half a dozen to a dozen cases some of the companies are big including public companies and name brands The companys own research indicates that the hackers demands usually an exchange of untraceable Bitcoin are increasing Ideally we wouldnt pay or wed negotiate down a lot says Mr Siegel but we recognise that when a company needs to pay  and its a large number  then thats what needs to happen and that can be seven figures  Everybody recognises that this is not a good outcome but youre dealing with the life or death of a company The most infamous ransomware virus was called WannaCry and infected 200000 computers in at least 150 countries including causing notable disruption to the National Health Service in the UK  Since then ransomware attack numbers have actually declined significantly Cyber Security vendor Trend Micro estimates that numbers could have dropped 91 in the past year But data from many other vendors points to a rise in more targeted attacks where companies and organisations instead of individuals are in the crosshairs image caption Norsk Hydros Jo De Vliegher says its a very bad idea to pay Researchers at cybersecurity company Malwarebytes say that compared to the same time last year business detections of ransomware have risen more than 500  Back at Norsk Hydro Mr De Vliegher said he tries not to think of the hackers and takes no satisfaction in knowing he foiled their plans  I think in general its a very bad idea to pay he says It fuels an industry and its probably financing other sorts of crime It goes against our company values and we have good foundations and good people But I understand why for some companies who are less secure this can be the only option His words are echoed by Europols head of the European Cybercrime Centre Steven Wilson  Companies need to understand that if you continue to pay a ransom it perpetuates the crime he says It encourages the criminals to commit further crimes

of Health and the NHS must now get their act together Cyberattack Your questions answered WannaCry What can you do to protect your business Malware patches and worms defined WannaCry which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May was  the biggest cyberattack to have hit the NHS  to date The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to Â£230 300 The  NAO report  said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom  but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cybersecurity standards image copyright Getty Images image caption As a result of disruption caused by

contributed to the rapid spread of the malware He said The problem with cyber security for the NHS is that it has a particular vulnerability Its very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also frankly a lack of focus a lack of taking it seriously for individual NHS organisations failure to keep up with cybersecurity improvements This was an extremely unsophisticated attack he added  The NAO said the NHS has accepted that there are lessons to learn from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan It will also ensure that critical cybersecurity updates  such as applying software patches  are carried out by IT staff the NAO said WannaCry was a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice said Sir Amyas Morse comptroller and auditorgeneral of the NAO There are more sophisticated cyberthreats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks Keith McNeil NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care said As the NAO report makes clear no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hardworking NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum image copyright EPA Analysis  by Rory CellanJones technology correspondent For many executives a serious cyberattack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event  To be fair the Department of Health had developed a plan  it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts When disaster struck nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do Of course all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS Once again there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital but many trusts failed to act upon them  though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit In one way the NHS was lucky  if instead of a Friday in May the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter with a weeks appointments affected the damage would have been far worse Cybersecurity experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cybersecurity crisis View comments Related Topics Cybersecurity National Audit Office NHS More on this story NHS ransomware attacks bitcoins

Getty Images After a cyberattack disrupted IT services across the globe many people have written to the BBC with questions about why it happened how you can protect your computers and smartphones and if the attackers will be caught BBC Technology reporter Chris Foxx and security expert Prof Alan Woodward provide some answers WannaCry ransomware cyberattacks slow but fears remain Why doesnt the NHS used a closed secure network like the military Practically speaking its not possible to completely isolate the NHS network said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward The NHS sends emails to patients who have email addresses outside of the NHS network  People in the NHS also use the internet heavily for research just like academics Even a private network can be compromised especially in an organisation with thousands of people using it daily  Once a virus has managed to enter the larger network it can then use vulnerabilities to spread said Prof Woodward Will banks and personal finances be affected Since serving customers online is now part of banks bread and butter you would expect cybersecurity to be at the very top of their priorities  Cybersecurity is a game of cat and mouse with criminals always thinking of new ways to attack systems so no organisation is totally impenetrable  This ransomware outbreak is mostly likely to affect your finances if you get infected and pay the ransom which security experts say you should not do  There is absolutely no guarantee the criminals would give your files back If you run a business there is detailed guidance on the  National Cyber Security Centre website  you can follow to make sure your company is protected How the cyberattack can be traced to the US Should you pay the WannaCry ransom Is my computer at risk How can I personally protect my device from ransomware Microsoft has already identified the way this specific strain of ransomware spread from device to device and has issued a  issued a fix   As long as your operating system is uptodate you should be protected from this strain of ransomware  Always make sure you are running the latest version of your operating system with the latest security fixes installed  and run uptodate antivirus software from a trusted company Although this strain of ransomware was not spread by email always beware suspicious emails asking you to click links or download attachments Criminals will often use a widely publicised virus outbreak to send scam emails pretending to offer help  To prevent heartbreak if the worst comes to the worst you should keep a backup copy of important files photos and videos on an external hard drive   Make sure to disconnect the drive from your computer after making your backup so ransomware cant access it if your computer is infected The bottom line is that all you can really do is keep your software including your virus checker up to date Ideally have updates set to automatic said Prof Woodward Why are the attackers doing this The purpose of a ransomware attack is to extort money from victims  It is a powerful attack because people may fear losing their documents and photographs and so may be more likely to pay  When it hits businesses and hospitals there is extra pressure to get rid of the ransomware quickly  The government has said the ransomware outbreak at the NHS was not a targeted attack on the UKs health service  It may be that the attackers created their virus without knowing exactly how far it would spread  Do you have to open an email attachment to be infected No This strain of ransomware was spread from device to device by taking advantage of an old security hole in some versions of Microsofts Windows operating system  The hole is fixed in the latest versions of Windows  image copyright PA However ransomware can be spread in rogue email attachments so do not click links or open attachments in unsolicited emails Practice ABC  assume nothing believe noone check everything says Prof Woodward Are there potential cyberattacks that can affect other operating systems Yes every operating system could theoretically be attacked Criminals tend to target systems such as Windows or the Android mobile operating system because they are more widely used increasing the chance of people falling victim  Will the people behind the ransomware be caught In the same way that a burglar breaking into a home can cover their tracks cybercriminals can go to great lengths to hide their identity However many cybercriminals have been caught and brought to justice  and the UKs National

to protect yourself online A computer malware that has spread across 150 countries appears to be slowing down with few reports of fresh attacks globally on Monday A spokesperson for police agency Europol said the situation in Europe seems stable In Asia where many offices closed before the WannaCry ransomware struck on Friday the attack has been less severe than expected The ransomware takes over users files demanding 300 Â£230 to restore them The White House said on Monday that under 70000 Â£54000 had been paid in total in a bid to get any locked data released Payments could go up as the

been meeting in Italy to discuss the threat of cyberattacks on the global financial system They are expected to release a statement later in which they pledge greater cooperation in the fight against cybercrime including spotting potential vulnerabilities and assessing security measures media caption The BBCs Rory Cellan Jones explains how Bitcoin works How does the malware work and who is behind it The infections seem to be deployed via a worm  a program that spreads by itself between computers Most other malicious programs rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code By contrast once WannaCry is inside an organisation it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too  Some experts say the attack may have been built to exploit a weakness in Microsoft systems that had been identified by the NSA and given the name EternalBlue The NSA tools were stolen by a group of hackers known as The Shadow Brokers who made  it freely available  in April saying it was a protest about US President Donald Trump At the time some cybersecurity experts said some of the malware was real but old A patch for the vulnerability was released by Microsoft in March which would have automatically protected those computers with Windows Update enabled Microsoft  said on Friday  it would roll out the update to users of older operating systems that no longer receive mainstream support such Windows XP which the NHS still largely uses Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003 media caption Technology explained what is ransomware The number of infections seems to be slowing after a kill switch appears to have been accidentally triggered by a UKbased cybersecurity researcher tweeting as  MalwareTechBlog  He was  quoted as saying  he noticed the web address the virus was searching for had not been registered  and when he registered it the virus appeared to stop spreading But he warned this was a temporary fix and urged computers users to patch your systems ASAP Why do companies still use Windows XP By Chris Foxx technology reporter Many jobs can be done using software everyone can buy but some businesses need programs that perform very specific jobs  so they build their own  For example a broadcaster might need specialist software to track all the satellite feeds coming into the newsroom and a hospital might need custombuilt tools to analyse Xray images Developing niche but useful software like this can be very expensive  the programming testing maintenance and continued development all adds up   Then along comes a new version of Windows and the software isnt compatible Companies then face the cost of upgrading computers and operating system licenses as well as the cost of rebuilding their software from scratch So some choose to keep running the old version of Windows instead For some companies that is not a huge risk In a hospital the stakes are higher Related Topics Cybersecurity Spain More on this story NHS

close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright neelmehta image caption A coded tweet from a Google researcher first raised suspicions of a North Korea link Who was behind the huge global cyberattack One prominent theory right now is North Korea  but what we know is far from conclusive  You may not have heard of the Lazarus Group but you may be aware of its work The devastating  hack on Sony Pictures in 2014  and another on a  Bangladeshi bank in 2016  have both been attributed to the highly sophisticated group  It is widely believed that the Lazarus Group worked out of China but on behalf of the North Koreans  Security experts are now cautiously linking the Lazarus Group to this latest attack after a discovery by Google security researcher  Neel Mehta  He found similarities between code found within WannaCry  the software used in the hack  and other tools believed to have been created by the Lazarus Group in the past  Its a mere sliver of evidence but there are other clues to consider too Cyberattack Your questions answered Should you pay the WannaCry ransom Cyberattack Is my computer at risk Global manhunt for WannaCry creators Picking apart the code Prof Alan Woodward a security expert pointed out to me that the text demanding the ransom uses what reads like machinetranslated English with a Chinese segment apparently written by a native speaker As you can see its pretty thin and all circumstantial Prof Woodward said However its worth further investigation image copyright EPA image caption The WannaCry malware threatens to delete users data unless they pay a ransom Neel Mehtaâs discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCryâ said Russian security firm  Kaspersky  but noted a lot more information is needed about earlier versions of WannaCry before any firm conclusion can be reached  We believe itâs important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of WannaCryâ the company added  Looking back to the Bangladesh attack in the early days there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus Group  In time more evidence appeared and allowed us and others to link them together with high confidence Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots  Attributing cyberattacks can be notoriously difficult  often relying on consensus rather than confirmation   For example North Korea has never admitted any involvement in the Sony Pictures hack  and while security researchers and the US government have confidence in the theory neither can rule out the possibility of a false flag  Skilled hackers may have simply made it look like it had origins in North Korea by using similar techniques  Wouldnât stand up in court In the case of WannaCry it is possible that hackers simply copied code from earlier attacks by the Lazarus Group  media caption How to protect yourself online But Kaspersky said false flags within WannaCry were possible but improbable as the shared code was removed from later versions  Theres a lot of ifs in there added Prof Woodward  It wouldnt stand up in court as it is But its worth looking deeper being conscious of confirmation bias now that North Korea has been identified as a possibility Itâs the strongest theory yet as to the origin of WannaCry but there are also details that arguably point away from it being the work of North Korea   image copyright Getty Images image caption Few could have suspected a Seth Rogendirected film would have such global political repercussions First China was among the countries worst hit and not accidentally  the hackers made sure there was a version of the ransom note written in Chinese It seems unlikely North Korea would want to antagonise its strongest ally Russia too was badly affected  Second North Korean cyberattacks have typically been far more targeted often with a political goal in mind  In the case of Sony Pictures hackers sought to prevent the release of The Interview a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jongun WannaCry in contrast was wildly indiscriminate  it would infect anything and everything it could  Finally if the plan was simply to make money itâs been pretty unsuccessful on that front too  only around 60000 Â£46500 has been paid in ransoms according to analysis of Bitcoin accounts being used by the criminals   With more than 200000 machines infected its a terrible return But then of course maybe the ransom was a distraction for some other political goal not yet clear   Another possibility is that the Lazarus Group worked alone without instruction from North Korea Indeed it could be that the Lazarus Group isnât even linked to North Korea  More questions than answers  and in cyberwar facts are extremely hard to come by   View comments Related Topics North Korea Cybercrime Cybersecurity Cyberattacks More on this story Global manhunt for WannaCry creators

handful of NHS trusts are still dealing with the problems it caused Is my computer at risk Analysis How it started In a statement the National Cyber Security Centre said a ransomware attack of this type and on this scale could happen again although there is no specific evidence as yet   It said it knew of attempts to attack organisations other than the NHS and warned more cases could come to

The ransomware which locked users files and demanded payment to allow access spread to 150 countries including Russia the US and China In England 47 trusts reported problems at hospitals GP surgeries or pharmacies and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected  Some hospitals were forced to cancel treatment and appointments and unable to use computers many doctors resorted to using pen and paper  The cost of the attack is unknown in the UK or beyond but BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggest hackers have already been paid the equivalent of Â£22080  What can patients expect The Scottish government said the cyberattack had been isolated and it expected that most NHS computers would be back to normal by Monday NHS England has told patients to attend hospital if they have an appointment unless they are told not to However several trusts in England have issued their own advice to patients As of Sunday night they were St Bartholomews in London  IT

its IT systems What are the political parties saying The government is insisting that the NHS had been repeatedly warned about the cyberthreat to their IT systems  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Â£50m of Â£19bn set aside for UK cyberprotection was being spent on NHS cyber systems to improve their security media caption The NHS has been given about Â£50m to improve its computer systems defence minister Michael Fallon says But Labour say the Conservatives have cut funding to the NHSs IT budget and specifically a contract to protect computer systems was not renewed after 2015 The Liberal Democrats and Labour have both demanded an inquiry into the cyberattack  In an interview on BBC Ones Andrew Marr show Sir Michael said NHS trusts had been encouraged to reduce their exposure to the weakest system the Windows XP with fewer than 5 of trusts using it now  We want them to use modern systems that are better protected We warned them and they were warned again in the spring They were warned again of the threats he added Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ask why concerns repeatedly flagged up about the NHSs outdated unsupported and vulnerable machines had not been addressed On ITVs Robert Peston Mr Ashworth accused the government of having cut the IT and infrastructure budget by Â£1bn in the NHS and said his party if elected to power would put Â£10bn into the infrastructure of the NHS He called for the Conservatives to publish the  Department of Healths risk register  to see how seriously they were taking IT threats Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said more than 120 public bodies were being contacted to ensure their defences were adequate What are others saying Kingsley Manning a former chairman of NHS Digital  which provides the health services IT systems  told the BBC on Saturday that several hundred thousand computers were still running on Windows XP And a neurology registrar from London Dr Krishna Chinthapalli wrote an article for the British Medical Journal just a week ago  warning that hospitals would almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year He told the BBC the NHS was in a tricky position  treating sick patients as a 247 operation with specialist software  making update implementation complicated  People developing ransomware know a hospital is a good target because the information is about patients and is timesensitive  hospitals need to get their data back quicker he said  Attacks on hospital data and patients were despicable at the basic level he said image copyright PA Meanwhile digital rights campaigners Open Rights Group has accused GCHQ of a very dangerous strategy of hoarding knowledge of security problems It said Britains electronic surveillance agency was in charge of hacking us and protecting us from hackers making it hard to balance the risks of keeping vulnerabilities secret Jim Killock the groups executive director said US and UK security agencies kept a widespread vulnerability secret rather than telling the companies so they could fix it He called for the National Cyber Security Centre to be made independent from GCHQ

to protect yourself online A cyberattack that has hit 150 countries since Friday should be treated by governments around the world as a wakeup call Microsoft says It blamed governments for storing data on software vulnerabilities which could then be accessed by hackers It says the latest virus exploits a flaw in Microsoft Windows identified by and stolen from US intelligence There are fears of more ransomware attacks as people begin work on Monday although few have been reported so far Live reports Ransomware cyberattack fallout Should you pay the WannaCry ransom Many firms have had experts working over the weekend to prevent new infections The virus took control of users files and demanded 300 Â£230 payments to restore access The spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief experts have said More than 200000 computers have been affected so far Read more Is my computer at risk Blogger halts ransomware by accident How roots can be traced to the US Who is hardest hit BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggests about 38000 Â£29400 had been paid by Monday morning However the ransomware warning said that the cost would double after three days so the payments may increase It threatens to delete files within seven days if no payment is made The effect in Asian nations so far on Monday has been limited South Korea said just nine cases of ransomware had been found giving no further details media caption Technology explained what is ransomware Australian officials said so far only three smalltomedium sized businesses had reported being locked out of their systems while New Zealands ministry of business said a small number of unconfirmed incidents were being investigated In Japan both Nissan and Hitachi reported some units had been affected while in China energy giant PetroChina said that at some petrol stations customers had been unable to use its payment system Like stealing Tomahawks A statement from  Microsoft  president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world he wrote media caption Europol director Rob Wainwright warned that companies must patch their systems before Monday morning An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen He added The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wakeup call The organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date allowing the virus to spread Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack but many users were yet to run it As cybercriminals become more sophisticated there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems Mr Smith said Analysis Dave Lee BBC North America technology reporter There are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didnt do enough to keep their networks secure as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place  the NSA and Microsoft The NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous If there is a flaw in Windows the company said surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed But then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users  not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems  Updating your computer if youre an individual is a piece of cake but for a network the size of Britains National Health Service Tough  timeconsuming expensive and complex  For a company like Microsoft to say it wont keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money then that in itself is something of a ransom Meanwhile Europols chief told the BBC the ransomware was designed to allow infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks adding Thats why were seeing these numbers increasing all the time Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate the attackers had now released a new version of the virus he said A UK security researcher known as MalwareTech who helped to limit the ransomware attack predicted another one coming quite likely on Monday MalwareTech whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22yearold Marcus Hutchins was hailed as an accidental hero after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus which actually ended up halting it image copyright Reuters Becky Pinkard from Digital Shadows a UKbased cybersecurity firm told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or copycat authors to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday we should expect it soon afterwards she said In England 48 National Health Service NHS trusts reported problems at hospitals doctor surgeries or pharmacies and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected Further attacks feared on UK health system Ransomware

only acute hospital sites so far affected had been in NHS Lanarkshire First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was no evidence that patient data had been compromised She said All necessary steps are being taken to ensure that the cause and nature of this attack is identified Our priority is to ensure that boards get all the support required to identify the full extent of any problems and return IT systems to normal as soon as possible so there is as little impact on patient care as possible I would like to thank all of the NHS staff who are continuing to work hard to ensure that the impact of this attack is kept to an absolute minimum  I have complete confidence that they will continue to provide the excellent care for which they are famous GPs have no idea what drugs people are on Dr Emma Fardon a GP in Dundee told the BBC It became very obvious at around 1pm I came back from house visits to find all our computers hit by the virus It was the red display asking for the money  We cant access any patient records  Everything is fully computerised We have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have We cant access the appointments system Weve had to try and phone as many people to rearrange their appointments to next week Its had a massively disruptive effect We cant process any documents cant issue prescriptions or look up results Were trying to accommodate

Tayside IT system were having problems A spokeswoman said No NHS Tayside systems or hospital sites have been affected by todays UKwide cyber attack There is no impact on NHS Taysides emergency departments or outofhours service However we are aware that the IT systems at 10 GP practices across Tayside which operate on a nonNHS Tayside system have been affected Our eHealth team is working with the GPs to resolve the issue as soon as possible  Analysis  What is ransomware media caption Technology explained what is ransomware By  Chris Baraniuk BBC technology reporter Software that locks a computer and demands payment before allowing access again  ransomware  is one of the worlds biggest growing cyberthreats It certainly looks like that is what has hit the NHS in this case  and  one IT firm says 11 of its NHS customers  have been affected Screenshots shared online purportedly from NHS staff show a program demanding 300 Â£230 in Bitcoin that looks similar to ransomware known as  WannaCryptor or WCry  Theres no indication of who is behind the attack yet nor do we know exactly how it infected NHS systems But hospitals have been targeted with similar software before  it struck  three US hospitals last year  NHS Borders said three community sites had been affected A spokesman said The networks have been isolated software has been shut down and there is no immediate risk to patient care or confidentiality All other NHS Borders services are currently operating as normal A spokesman for NHS Dumfries and Galloway said Three GP practices have been initially affected and we are taking precautionary measures to prevent any others being affected He declined the name the practices involved and said the board was comfortable and confident with the steps taken but added we dont know what were dealing with He added We are monitoring the situation here as are all health boards in Scotland NHS Fife said the attack had affected a small nonoperational area of its system Patient records A spokeswoman said This area has been isolated and taken off the network Staff continue to be able to access patient records and clinical systems are unaffected It is important to note that out of hours services remain open and available as normal and patient care is unaffected We have taken guidance from Scottish government on how to protect ourselves from any spread and we are also undertaking further preventative work Western Isles health board reported some disruption though the extent was not clear NHS Forth Valley confirmed that some of its services had also been affected In a statement the health board said We can confirm that a small number of GP and dental practices in the Forth Valley area have experienced disruption to their it systems which may be linked to the wider IT issues affecting parts of NHS England  Steps have been taken to isolate their IT systems to minimise the risk of any virus spreading to other parts of the NHS  The practices affected remain open and have put in place contingency arrangements image copyright Getty Images image caption Cyber criminals are demanding payment in the online bitcoin currency to unlock computer systems An NHS Western Isles spokeswoman said We can confirm that we have been affected but cant confirm to what extent at the moment We do have systems in place to cover all emergencies Meanwhile ScottishPower said that it had taken measures to ensure its IT services were not affected A spokesman said Due to an issue at an external company ScottishPower has taken precautionary steps to ensure that our IT systems are fully secure We continue to monitor the situation  In England GP surgeries and hospitals in London Blackburn Nottingham Cumbria and Hertfordshire were among those whose computer systems were affected Staff were unable to access patient data which has been encrypted by ransomware that hit NHS networks  There was no evidence patient data had been compromised Are you a staff or a

sharing image caption University College Oxford is among more than 20 colleges hit by the cyberattack More than 20 universities and charities in the UK US and Canada have confirmed they are victims of a cyberattack that compromised a software supplier Blackbaud was held to ransom by hackers in May and paid an undisclosed ransom to cybercriminals The USbased firm is the worlds largest provider of education administration fundraising and financial management software Blackbaud is not revealing the scale of the breach Dozens more charities and educational organisations may have been affected The cloud service company is facing criticism after taking weeks to warn victims that data had been stolen In some cases the personal details were limited to those of former students who had been asked to financially support the establishments from which they had graduated But in other cases it extended to staff existing students and other supporters The institutions the BBC has confirmed have been affected are University of Birmingham De Montfort University University of Strathclyde University of Exeter  University of York Oxford Brookes University Loughborough University University of Leeds University of London University of Reading University College Oxford Middlebury College Vermont West Virginia University New College of Florida Cheverus High School Catholic High School Portland The Bishop Strachan School Canada University of North Florida Ambrose University Alberta Canada Rhode Island School of Design US Other organisations including charities confirmed as affected are Choir with No Name Vermont Foodbank Vermont Public Radio Northwest Immigrant Rights Project Human Rights Watch Young Minds All the institutions are sending letters and emails apologising to those on the compromised databases image copyright Getty Images image caption The University of York is one of those affected In some cases the stolen data included phone numbers donation history and events attended Credit card and other payment details do not appear to have been exposed A spokesman from the UKs National Cyber Security Centre said We are aware of this incident and are supporting partners in the UK and internationally in response We would urge all organisations to read our guidance on how to defend themselves against malware and ransomware attacks Blackbaud whose headquarters are in South Carolina insists that the majority of our customers were not part of this incident  It referred the BBC to a statement on its website In May of 2020 we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack Prior to our locking the cybercriminal out the cybercriminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our selfhosted environment Paid the hackers The statement goes on to say Blackbaud paid the ransom demand Doing so is not illegal but goes against the advice of numerous law enforcement agencies including the FBI NCA and Europol Blackbaud said once the hackers had been paid they had given confirmation that the copy of data they removed had been destroyed It is worrying that the supplier paid the ransom as arguably this encourages future attacks and doesnt overcome the fact that data has been compromised This demonstrates the multiplier effect of supply chain hacks and reinforces the advice that security needs to be a collaborative exercise Cath Goulding chief information security officer at cybersecurity firm Nominet said  image copyright Getty Images image caption Oxford Brookes University is among those contacting students about the hack Its unclear how many individuals have been sent notifications but some alumni and students affected have expressed concerns on social media and to the BBC that they are now worried about the cybercriminals being true to their word Privacy law Questions are being asked about why Blackbaud took weeks to inform its customers of the hack  Under General Data Protection Regulation GDPR companies must report a significant breach to data authorities within 72 hours of learning of an incident  or face potential fines The UKs Information Commissioners Office ICO as well as the Canadian data authorities were informed about the breach last weekend  weeks after Blackbaud discovered the hack On the notice to its students West Virginia University Foundation said it was working with Blackbaud to understand why there was a delay between it finding the breach and notifying us as well as what actions Blackbaud is taking to increase its security One of the affected institutions told the BBC the hack is affecting a product called

the security risks of falling behind China in AI Strategic advantage Wars of the future may involve AI algorithms battling each other The first nation to master this and other technologies may not just have a significant military advantage on the battlefield but also in protecting its people at home and in spurring economic growth  That is why the UKs review says its first goal is growing the UKs science and technology power in pursuit of strategic advantage We need to generate strength through technological innovation former MI6 Chief Alex Younger told the BBC More cyberattacks Some of this focuses on traditional areas At least Â£66bn of defence funding over the next four years will go on research and development  Some of this will support industries in particular regions of the UK  a sign of the fusing of security and economic priorities  In addition a national space strategy will be launched as well as a new cyberstrategy that could see more frequent use of offensive capabilities by the new National Cyber Force  UK investment will be dwarfed by China and the US But the ambition is that a more activist industrial policy can create thriving ecosystems in crucial areas  Geneedited troops Three fields are picked out for case studies One is quantum computing where the review argues the UK is well placed to emerge as a global leader  The muchheralded quantum breakthrough will offer major advantages to those who get there first This includes one field governments do not talk about breaking the encryption which keeps messages secret image copyright Getty

techniques like gene editing  This has potential for health and environmental benefits but also as the report notes defence and security  US intelligence officials have suggested China was exploring geneediting its soldiers to improve their performance The third is AI The UK is home to cuttingedge research But critics also say it highlights some of the historic problems in commercialising domestic innovation  Londonbased DeepMind is worldclass but sold itself to Google The US may be a close ally but there are still officials who believe the shift of ownership represented a strategic loss Revolving door The failure to take UK research and grow tech giants from it is not a new problem  The UK built the first semiprogrammable computer in World War Two to break codes at Bletchley Park  But it did so in secret and the computing industry it led to has been limited in terms of scale By contrast the US with a revolving door between government and the private sector massive investment from the Pentagon and spy agencies and a larger domestic market created Silicon Valley There is also a question about where it will be practical to try to convince what is a highly

die but this had no effect on his abuser he added Wilson pleaded guilty to 54 counts of causing or inciting a child under 13 to engage in sexual activity 25 counts of causing or inciting a child to engage in sexual activity 10 counts of causing a child to watch a sexual act three counts of blackmail and four counts of arranging or facilitating the sexual exploitation of a child He was ordered to

themselves to an account seemingly belonging to a 13yearold girl The mother of one of Wilsons victims spoke of her concern over Facebooks plan to bring in  endtoend encryption of messages  on the platform Im eternally grateful that David Wilson was caught she said I think that if it becomes too difficult for law enforcement agencies to track these people then we wont be able to protect our children and people like him will be able to get away with it A spokeswoman for Facebook said Child exploitation and grooming have no place on our platform Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent detect and respond to abuse and we will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity Home Secretary Priti Patel said This sickening case is a chilling reminder of how crucial it is that tech companies play their part in combating child sexual abuse It is vital that Facebook do not press ahead without amending their current endtoendencryption plans otherwise

Images image caption Australian police can now order tech firms to access the encrypted messages of suspects Australia has passed controversial laws designed to compel technology companies to grant police and security agencies access to encrypted messages The government says the laws a world first are necessary to help combat terrorism and crime However critics have listed wideranging concerns including that the laws could undermine the overall security and privacy of users  The laws were rushed through parliament on its final day of the year The Labor opposition said it had reluctantly supported the laws to help protect Australians during the Christmas period but on Friday it said that legitimate concerns about them remained Cybersecurity experts have warned the laws could now create a global weak point for companies such as Facebook and Apple Why are encrypted messages an issue Australia already has laws which require providers to hand over a suspects communication to police  This may already be possible if a service provider uses a form of encryption that allows them to view a users message But in recent years services such as WhatsApp Signal and others have added an additional layer of security known as endtoend encryption FBI says device encryption is a huge problem Geeks v government The battle over public key cryptography Endtoend encryption allows only the sender and recipient to view a message preventing it from being unscrambled by the service provider  Australia and other countries have said that terrorists and criminals exploit this technology to avoid surveillance How would this change work It differs from laws in China Russia and Turkey where services offering endtoend encryption are banned Under Australias legislation police can force companies to create a technical function that would give them access to encrypted messages without the users knowledge image copyright EPA image caption Only two MPs Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie left voted against the bill This ensures that our national security and law enforcement agencies have the modern tools they need with appropriate authority and oversight to access the encrypted conversations of those who seek to do us harm AttorneyGeneral Christian Porter said However cybersecurity experts say its not possible to create a back door decryption that would safely target just one person  Any vulnerability would just weaken the existing encryption scheme affecting security overall for innocent people said Dr Chris Culnane from the University of Melbourne Such a security hole could then be abused or exploited by criminals he said  In a bid to address these concerns Australias law offers a safeguard which says decryptions wont go ahead if they create a systemic weakness However critics say the definition of systemic weakness is vague meaning it is unclear how it may be applied  What are the other concerns Digital rights advocates are highly critical of Australias move saying it lacks sufficient checks and balances The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said police could order individual IT developers to create technical functions without their companys knowledge This has the potential for Australian tech firms to have no clue whether they were even subject to an order the foundations Nate Cardozo told the BBC There is also criticism over how fast the laws were passed  A draft bill was presented only in August A parliamentary committee examining the legislation did not release its report until late on Wednesday  Labor initially proposed 173 amendments to the bill but agreed to drop them on Thursday so that the law would be passed this year In return the government pledged to debate possible amendments next year But the nations top legal society the Law Council of Australia said on Friday that the laws had been rammed through the parliament with inadequate consideration What does it mean for tech firms If companies dont comply with the laws they risk being fined  Thats led to speculation that some global firms which have vocally opposed the laws could withdraw from the Australian market However Dr Culnane said that most companies are likely to comply  partly because users wont be aware if their messages have been accessed However experts say the full implications are unclear and much uncertainty remains Some firms have already suggested that they may not be subject to Australian law Experts add that given the debate involves national security many aspects may play out behind closed doors We are

copyright Getty Images image caption By age 12 90 of children use an online messaging app  despite a 13 age requirement Encryption of online messages could make it harder to police child abuse and grooming online the childrens commissioner for England has warned  Endtoend encryption is a privacy feature that makes it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to read messages sent online Commissioner Anne Longfield said it also prevented police from gathering evidence to prosecute child abusers But digital rights groups see it as an essential part of online privacy Facebook which is behind the most popular messaging apps children use already offers endtoend encryption for Whatsapp  It has added an optin version to its Messenger service with plans to make it the default for all its platforms That could include Instagram which does not yet have it Messaging strangers Ms Longfields warning came as she launched a new report looking at how children used online messaging apps It found the vast majority of children aged eight and over used some sort of messaging service That includes 60 of eightyearolds and 90 of 12yearolds despite the main such apps having an age restriction of at least 13 if not older Child protectors urge Facebook encryption rethink Child abuse images being traded via apps More than a third of children surveyed for the report said they had received a message that made them feel uncomfortable One in 10 talk to strangers online and one in 20 have shared videos or photos of themselves with strangers Duty of care Ms Longfield said the report shows how vigilant parents need to be but also how the tech giants are failing to regulate themselves and so are failing to keep children safe She is calling on the government to make the big tech firms responsible when it introduces the longdelayed Online Harms Bill with large fines for companies that breach their duty of care She has warned against classifying encrypted messaging as private communications Doing so could offer an exemption for the tech giants on their duty of care she said That could be a cynical attempt on the part of some tech firms to sidestep sanctions and litigation she warned A spokesman for the Department for Digital Culture Media and Sport responded Children will be at the heart of our new online harms laws with tough sanctions on social media platforms that fail to protect young people from harm We are clear that firms should only implement endtoend encryption if it can be done without preventing action against child abuse  Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced in March 2019 that endtoend encryption was going to become standard across Facebooks messaging platforms the criticism of the plan has got ever louder  Mr Zuckerberg himself has admitted that the move could harm the fight against child abuse Youre fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back he told a Facebook staff meeting  Now the Childrens Commissioner has joined those warning of the damaging effects of making messages too secret  But her broadside may be aimed less at the tech firms than at the government which she and other critics feel has dragged its heels on the issue of regulating online content  A year and a half after the publication of  the Online Harms White Paper there is still no clarity about when it will be turned into law and what sort of sanctions might be in it  This week saw Labours Margaret Hodge a victim of online abuse call for either an end to anonymity on social media or for directors of the platforms to be made liable for defamatory posts  The critics shopping list for measures against the tech giants is getting longer Meanwhile ministers must try to work out what is practicable as well as desirable The commissioner says that endtoend encryption should not be applied at all to childrens accounts and that tech companies should retain the ability to scan for child sexual abuse material Its time for the government to show it hasnt lost its nerve and that it is prepared to stand up to the powerful internet giants who are such a big part in our childrens lives she said media caption What is encryption Digital rights organisations however have long argued that encryption is essential The Open Rights Group  accuses the government of using the Online Harms Bill to weaken security for everyone warning that a ban on encryption would create a degree of surveillance and government intrusion that simply should not be tolerated in a democratic society The  Electronic Frontier Foundation  meanwhile says encryption is one of the most powerful tools individuals have for maintaining their digital privacy and security in an increasingly insecure world Facebook as the owner of three messaging apps said that child exploitation has no place on our platforms and that it has been developing news ways to prevent and detect abuse But it remains in favour of encryption with added antiabuse features Endtoend encryption is already the leading technology used by many services to keep people safe a spokesman said Through a combination of advanced technology and user reports WhatsApp bans around

February Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright NCA image caption From his bedroom in Kirstead Kings Lynn David Wilson built a web of false personas to target thousands of children both in the UK and abroad They were lured in by messages seemingly from a teenage girl From there the young victims were not only enticed into sharing sexualised images of themselves but in some cases blackmailed to commit abuse by proxy on their younger siblings How was David Wilson  the man behind the teenage girl mask  eventually caught David Wilson a roofer who lived at his mothers Norfolk home was one of the most prolific offenders the National Crime Agency NCA had ever come across From his bedroom in Kirstead in Kings Lynn the 36yearold built a web of false personas to target thousands of children both in the UK and abroad At Ipswich Crown Court on Wednesday Wilson was  sentenced to 25 years for 96 child sex offences  As many as 500 victims sent him images One of them told the BBC how they felt trapped inside his game And yet the first concerns about Wilsons behaviour came not from the victims themselves or from police intelligence  but from a Facebook algorithm Those involved in bringing him to justice now fear whether  Facebook plans to use endtoend encryption  might mean people like Wilson might evade justice in the future The crimes image caption Wilson blackmailed and coerced his victims said National Crime Agency director Rob Jones Wilsons modus operandi was deception and blackmail He created fake personas of young girls and then used prepaid mobile telephones to target boys the majority of whom were aged between 11 and 13 years old via social media Once he made contact he coerced those children to abuse themselves or others and produce images of that abuse said Rob Jones director of the National Crime Agency  As soon as Wilson established a relationship he would incite and blackmail and really try to establish control over that child by threatening them to a whole range of different tactics which were designed to allow him to control the child to commit abuse and and to victimise other children Once he had a compromising image of a child Wilson would then use it to blackmail the victim into sending increasingly extreme imagery of themselves or in some cases to commit sexual abuse  or contact offending by proxy  on their siblings One of his victims was just four years old It is happening in peoples homes  created by people like Wilson who is able to do it remotely because of access to social media platforms and the use of false personas said Mr Jones The case against him involved 51 boys But officers unearthed hundreds of victims who had been lured into sending images of themselves by Wilson Those he was abusing had no idea who he was said Mr Jones By the time Wilson was charged officers had evidence of seven fake female identities 14 separate social media accounts and five prepaid mobile telephones  All had one user  David Wilson image copyright NCA image caption One of the victims said Wilson continued to increase his abusive behaviour despite knowing how frightened they were I was very very scared One of his victims is now 16 years old He was 11 when he was first contacted by Wilson I was completely unaware of dangerous people online and in the world the boy said When he set up his social media account he had a number of friends on there  and a girl purporting to be about 12 years old She contacted me and I had a look at her account to see what she looked like She looked like a normal girl about my age and it didnt concern me and she also talked and approached me in a way that was very normal he said It didnt alarm me so I decided to carry on talking to her thinking it was just a girl my age Over time I was attracted to this person who I thought was a pretty young girl but as it progressed I began to feel very alarmed by the way they started to talk to me I was concerned that this wasnt a girl and I was very scared I kept on asking him to leave me alone and the only way he would leave me alone was if I sent him indecent images In a desperate bid to free himself from Wilson the boy agreed to send some sexual images of himself Two years later the boy was approached by a second girl online The boy asked her to leave him alone but the girl refused and said they had indecent images of him from two years ago I was very very scared the boy said She requested more indecent images and if not supplied she would spread it all across the internet despite knowing I was extremely frightened I was trapped inside his game Tony Cook the NCAs head of child exploitation and online protection said These children and their families had their lives turned upside down  some of them never recover psychologically I must pay tribute to the bravery of the people who came forward Theyve been very patient with us He was getting them to do very very depraved and degrading acts It doesnt bear thinking about what he was having those children do The algorithm image caption Tony Cook described Wilson as despicable The social media giant Facebook uses an algorithm to scan messages sent over its platform They are able to detect the type of behaviour in messaging and in the exchange of images which is indicative as the sexual abuse of children said Mr Jones They are really really good at that Intelligence from Facebook was shared with the NCA in 2017 which identified 20 accounts of boys aged between 12 and 15 years old sending indecent images of themselves to an account of a 13yearold girl Wilsons case was one of 90 referrals made to the NCA from Facebook via the US  National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children  From the information from Facebook detectives were able to put together their case The IP addresses used to commit the crimes were linked to his mothers home They had CCTV footage of him buying a topup voucher for a phone linked to one of his fake accounts And when he was arrested in August 2017 the telephone used to commit some of the offences was found hidden in his bedroom But at that stage the full scale of Wilsons offending remained unclear Officers wanted to examine evidence from his Snapchat Google and Instagram accounts too That involved filing an International Letter of Request to the US authorities It was nearly two years before the NCA received its data trove from the US It contained more than 250000 messages for detectives to pore over It revealed Wilsons victims lived across the UK the US and Australia Could he have been stopped earlier image copyright NAtional Crime Agency image caption All 96 offences Wilson pictured at the moment of his fourth arrest admitted at court in November 2020 happened after he was first arrested by Norfolk Police on 4 April 2015 By the time Wilson was charged for crimes committed between 2016 and 2020 he had been arrested on four separate occasions He admitted to all 96 offences at Ipswich Crown Court in November 2020 but all those crimes took place after he was first arrested by Norfolk Police on 4 April 2015 That arrest was connected with two counts of possessing indecent images of children No action at that stage was taken by police Responding to the BBCs questions about that first arrest a spokesperson for Norfolk Constabulary said Officers carried out a search of the property and investigated the matter however found no evidence to link him to the crimes and consequently no action was taken  Due to ongoing concerns around safeguarding he was subject to further measures through a multiagency Local Authority Designated Officer meeting where a referral was made to the Disclosure and Barring Service This meant employers would be informed of the concerns and the Football Association were also made aware as he had connections to childrens football But it did not stop his offending  not even after the National Crime Agency got involved The NCA arrested Wilson three times during its threeyear investigation  in August 2017 January 2018 and finally in April 2020 He continued to offend even when wed arrested him And we arrested him three times so he was a pretty determined individual said Mr Cook of the NCA Hes been grooming and preying on very vulnerable young children and getting them to send him very indecent imagery of themselves and doing very degrading acts and then blackmailing them  I dont think you get more despicable than that do you But the NCA said it was not in a position to charge him before 2020 When youre dealing with somebody who has given a fake identification we have to be 100 certain that that person we arrest and charge is the person who is behind the fake identities said Mr Cook That takes a lot of time It is just one of those things  youve got to piece together the evidence like a jigsaw puzzle until you can prove that the fake identities are linked to David Wilson The NCA now feared whether it will be able to bring people like Wilson to justice in the future Its concerns the agency said stem from proposals within Facebook to use endtoend encryption in its Messenger platform Mr Jones said had such encryption been in place in 2017 it would have been highly unlikely Wilson would have been caught Had that content been endendencrypted there is a real risk that justice would not have been served and Wilson would still be abusing victims today he said A spokesman for Facebook said Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent detect and respond to abuse and we will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity The company told the BBC child exploitation had no place on its platforms and said it would build on the

Copy link About sharing media caption WATCH Home Secretary Amber Rudd wants harmful content to be autoblocked The major technology companies must step up their fight against extremism or face new laws the home secretary has told the BBC Amber Rudd said technology companies were not doing enough to beat âthe enemyâ on the internet  Encryption tools used by messaging apps had become a âproblemâ she added Ms Rudd is meeting with representatives from Google Facebook Twitter Microsoft and others at a counterterrorism forum in San Francisco Tuesdayâs summit is the first gathering of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism an organisation set up by the major companies in the wake of recent terror attacks In a joint statement  the companies taking part said  they were cooperating to âsubstantially disrupt terrorists ability to use the internet in furthering their causes while also respecting human rightsâ  WhatsApp must not be place for terrorists to hide Euro MPs back endtoend encryption for all citizens Australian PM seeks access to encrypted messages Ms Rudd is expected to tell companies that extremists should not be allowed to upload content at all Thatâs what weâre really trying to achieve she told the BBC What technology companies have been saying to us is using artificial intelligence theyâre beginning to make progress in that wayâ  Privacy rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation has expressed concern about the possibility of heavyhanded blocking of content  It said such a move would have a significant impact on free speech online Encryption  a common feature of business and personal communications  was the ducttape that holds the internet together said Ross Anderson cryptography expert at the University of Cambridge He added that he was worried authorities and Silicon Valley firms were making an agreement behind closed doors that would ultimately undermine security Endtoend In recent years messaging services including Facebook Apple and Google have adopted endtoend encryption an added layer of complexity that makes it almost impossible for messages to be accessed without a userâs permission The measure has been heralded by the technology companies as a vital tool for privacy But authorities around the world say endtoend encryption has created unreachable parts of the internet media caption What is encryption Ms Rudd told the BBC that the UK government supported encryption with caveats We support its place in making sure that we have secure facilities in our daily livesâ the home secretary said However there is a problem in terms of the growth of endtoend encryption Itâs a problem for the security services and for police who are not under the normal way under properly warranted paths able to access that information âWe want technology companies to work more closely with us on endtoend encryption so that where there is particular need where there is targeted need under warrant they share more information with us so that we can access itâ She said companies should give up more metadata about messages being sent via their services  Metadata refers to information about a conversation  such as who took part when and for how long  but not the contents itself When pressed on what kind of metadata she wanted she replied âIâm having those conversations in privateâ Technology companies are likely to resist any action that would result in them being seen to be sharing too much data with governments  In an  interview with BBC Radio 4s Desert Island Discs  programme Facebooks chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg warned about pushing criminals into even harder to reach parts of the internet If people move off those encrypted services to go to encrypted services in countries that wont share the metadata the government actually has less information not more she said Blocking uploads Ms Rudd said if the companies did not take it upon themselves to clamp down on the spread of extremist content new legislation could be introduced  âNone of this material should be online They need to take ownership over making sure it isnâtâ Ms Rudd told the BBC  Itâs governments that need to urge them to really take action so that we donât have to go down the road of legislation  and get them to do it on a voluntary but urgent basis  âLegislation is always an alternativeâ Specifically the home secretary said companies must seek to block material at source  building on efforts already put in place by companies such as Facebook  âThey have to make sure the material terrorists want to put up gets taken downâ she said or even better doesnât go up in the first place David Greene from the Electronic Frontier Foundation said rights campaigners were concerned this approach would lead to content being blocked incorrectly  âWeâre concerned that itâs going to lead to more takedownsâ he said not more terrorist content but more content thatâs mistaken for terrorist content being taken downâ   Follow Dave Lee  on Twitter DaveLeeBBC You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-35659152|How did governments lose control of encryption Published 2 March 2016 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright iStock The clash between  Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone  used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades  Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends But in the 1970s cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the socalled Crypto Wars  Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the  BBC World Service Inquiry programme  about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI  Whitfield Diffie The revolution begins In 1975 cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised public key cryptography which revolutionised encryption  The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world and were known from about 800 in the Middle East  They are basically arithmetic Not ordinary integer arithmetic but something like clock arithmetic  its 11 oclock and you wait three hours and you get 2 oclock  and table lookups Whats the 5th element in the table Whats the 20th element  The trouble is you cant do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation A human being cant do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes  image copyright Getty Images image caption Whitfield Diffies discovery marked a paradigmatic shift in cryptography Before what we did you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation If you look at the US Department of Defense its very large but very centralised everybody knows the chain of command They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency NSA to manage the keys used by the military and government If you were in the military and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military they would supply you with a key and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever   But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends its for everybody to talk to everybody Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moments notice for these secure communications   Thats what browsers do with websites all the time Amazon eBay all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them at the very least the payment portion of it At the time the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf and it made several attempts to recapture its market Susan Landau Crypto Wars  Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute  Publickey cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary Thats what made it so powerful and so wonderful The NSA said Wait a minute this work should be classified They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done They didnt want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom  image copyright Getty Images image caption The NSA tried unsuccessfully to restrict access to Whitfield Diffies discovery There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA But it was settled fairly amicably fairly quickly The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government   The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications but theres a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services education agriculture The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction   Congress who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things They exercised tremendous control and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s It was quite ugly Another battle was over the clipper chip Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government The idea was that a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipperenabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home  But if youre doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily because the keys are held by its agencies It was a complete flop Outside the US no one wanted it Inside the US no one bought it It was a total failure The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography you needed an export licence from the US government   Much of the time you would get Were looking at it well get back to you Of course when youre selling high tech you dont need a delay of two months so you decide not to have strong encryption within the device  you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad  In 2000 the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption it looked as if the private sector won the battle  Alan Woodward Going dark Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence intelligence gathered from communications who has worked for the UK government in various roles  Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces Youd need to know whether that was a prelude to war or just an exercise One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side In the early 2000s it got harder Previously theyd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message  You just physically couldnt do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up But also the forms of encryption were becoming stronger The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard With a modern PC you can break that in a matter of seconds That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since  image copyright Thinkstock image caption People use the Tor network to browse the internet and communicate in private It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption where you were able to remain anonymous completely hidden Theres a thing called  the Tor network  which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble because you dont even know where that person is based never mind who theyre communicating with  Governments recognised that there wasnt a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective Its out there So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after its decrypted   They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used  They were the ones running it it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies  They had very good relationships Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies Its a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems  You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a nonencrypted form   All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out  Jeff Larson The Snowden Effect Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013  I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook your web browser talks to those servers over whats known as TLS which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic   The intelligence agencies  not only NSA and GCHQ but Canada and Australia and New Zealand had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies   They honed things like their power with super computers but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software and  perhaps a bit more troubling  the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption   So standards bodies write up heres how encryption works heres how you implement it in your software and the NSA was actually working against that effort image copyright Getty Images image caption Edward Snowdens revelations angered many in the technology sector Ever since the Snowden revelations were published in 2013 theres been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet   I think theres been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep their data confidential and secret  Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users I do believe that The Apple case is very hard I see the arguments on both sides I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information and I also see Apples need to protect its customers privacy   I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent What I would say is I like that this fight is

allow people to chat with relative anonymity by keeping their services encrypted But the battle is much more wideranging as established names such as Google and Apple promise to do more to ensure that encryption is used as default on their services After the revelations from whistleblower Edward Snowden about mass surveillance programs firms are determined to be seen to be putting the control of their data back in the hands of consumers In the past governments with the appropriate warrants could go to firms such as Apple and ask them to unlock the communications on phones image copyright Reuters image caption The iPhone 6 is encrypted by default and Apple cannot open it for anyone No more Apple has changed its infrastructure to make it impossible for it to hand over any data from the iPhone 6s iMessage service for example Such militarygrade lockdown of devices inevitably terrifies governments so it should come as no surprise that they are fighting back with new legislation Although it should be noted that the new legislation Mr Cameron referred to in his speech is probably just a resurrection of an old law  The Draft Communication Bill of 2012 dubbed the snoopers charter by critics aimed to extend the range of data that communication companies had to store for 12 months It would have included for the first time details of messages sent on social media webmail voice calls over the internet and gaming Officials would not have been able to see the content without a warrant but the bill was blocked by the Liberal Democrats Politics continues to dog attempts to revive it with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying after Mr Camerons latest speech that his party will continue to oppose any such legislation Cryptowars image copyright Thinkstock image caption Should governments have a master key to unlock communications At the heart of the debate is the question about how the government deals with the fact that communication data is increasingly being encrypted As Prof Alan Woodward a security expert from the University of Surrey puts it You can have all the legislation in the world but you still might not be able to read what youve got Encryption has long terrified governments  The socalled cryptowars began in the 1970s when the US government attempted to classify encryption as munition  The Clinton administration in the 1990s tried to get industry to adopt the socalled Clipper chip  an encryption chip for which the government had a backdoor The US government also tried to introduce something called key escrow  a policy that all encryption systems should leave a a spare key with a trusted third party When software developer Phil Zimmermann developed PGP a free massmarket encryption product for emails and files the US government attempted to prosecute him because someone had exported his software from the US without government permission Cybercriminals image copyright Thinkstock image caption Backdoors could be exploited by criminals And however outrageous this may sound now those two options remain the only ones for the government as two decades later they grapple with exactly the same issues So does the idea of a golden key a backdoor for the security service make any more sense now than it did in the 1990s Certainly the threat from terrorism is greater and few would argue with the sentiment that if you are in danger and a police officer turns up at your backdoor  you are going to let them in But the analogy implies that someone has control over who uses the backdoor and of course in the software sense this is impossible  A backdoor in software is not just something for the security service Anyone  including the criminals  may discover it and exploit it A UK cryptographic backdoor would become the number one global target for cybercriminals The UK government would not be able to keep it secure for long particularly if it needed to give access to police and security services said Matthew Bloch managing director of internet hosting firm Bytemark All of this has been debated before of course  Ahead of the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act which came into force in 2000 both options of a backdoor and the idea of a key stored by a third party were considered and rejected by lawmakers They opted instead for a third way  that someone in possession of an encryption key should be forced to hand it over to the authorities That too is fraught with complexities Often the person simply doesnt know the key It comes down to passwords on laptops and you cant force someone to hand these over said Prof Woodward And encryption technology is evolving Now there is a way of protecting secret information into the future so if a key is compromised the key agreed for a particular session changes he explained There are even technologies emerging that can give a false key which makes the system aware that the key was given under duress and wipes the data Mathematics not technology The technology industry tends to have a kneejerk reaction to attempts from government to interfere in its processes  Dont mess in things that you dont understand they warn The technology genie is out of the bottle and cannot be put back In this particular case some have interpreted Mr Camerons words as meaning that the government is seeking to ban in effect a technology that underpins the global economy SSL Secure Sockets Layer and TLS Transport Layer Security encryption protects financial details when people shop or bank online while socalled endtoend encryption such as PGP Pretty Good Privacy help keep personal messages private Encryption is mathematics not technology It cant be suppressed by law Mr Bloch told the BBC Whatever route the government elected in the UK in May decides to go Prof Woodward hopes that it will listen carefully to the technology industry The government will need to take a lot of wideranging advice as this has the potential to go spectacularly wrong It is also worth noting he added that the men involved in the Paris shootings were known to the authorities and had been under surveillance until it was deemed that the threat from them had lessened The security forces need better resources not more powers Related Topics Cybersecurity More on this story Clegg in snoopers charter attack Published 13 January 2015 New terror data

caption Encrypted communications are the biggest problem for police says European police chief A European police chief says the sophisticated online communications are the biggest problem for security agencies tackling terrorism  Hidden areas of the internet and encrypted communications make it harder to monitor terror suspects warns Europols Rob Wainwright Tech firms should consider the impact sophisticated encryption software has on law enforcement he said Mr Wainwright was talking to 5 Live Investigates A spokesman for TechUK the UKs technology trade association said With the right resources and cooperation between the security agencies and technology companies alongside a clear legal framework for that cooperation we can ensure both national security and economic security are upheld Mr Wainwright said that in most current investigations the use of encrypted communications was found to be central to the way terrorists operated  Its become perhaps the biggest problem for the police and the security service authorities in dealing with the threats from terrorism he explained Its changed the very nature of counterterrorist work from one that has been traditionally reliant on having good monitoring capability of communications to one that essentially doesnt provide that any more Mr Wainwright whose organisation supports police forces in Europe said terrorists were exploiting the dark net where users can go online anonymously away from the gaze of police and security services Secret messaging But he is also concerned at moves by companies such as Apple to allow customers to encrypt data on their smartphones And the development of heavily encrypted instant messaging apps is another cause for concern he said image copyright PA image caption Edward Snowden revealed that the UKs GCHQ was also involved in widespread surveillance of communications This meant people could send text and voice messages which police found very difficult or impossible to access he said We are disappointed by the position taken by these tech firms and it only adds to our problems in getting to the communications of the most dangerous people that are abusing the internet  Tech firms are doing it I suppose because of a commercial imperative driven by what they perceive to be consumer demand for greater privacy of their communications Surveillance Mr Wainwright acknowledged this was a result of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden who exposed how security services were conducting widespread surveillance of emails and messages  He said security agencies now had to work to rebuild trust between technology firms and the authorities  The TechUK spokesman told the programme From huge volumes of financial transactions to personal details held on devices the security of digital communications fundamentally underpins the UK economy  Encryption is an essential component of the modern world and ensures the UK retains its position as one of the worlds leading economies  Tech companies take their security responsibilities incredibly seriously and in the ongoing course of counterterrorism and other investigations engage with law enforcement and security agencies  The programme also found evidence that supporters of the Islamic State IS are using encrypted sites to radicalise or groom new recruits image copyright AP image

she needs to speak securely she should use an encrypted messaging app  The family of 15yearold Yusra Hussein from Bristol who went to Syria last year also believe she was groomed in this way Twitter terrorism The extent of the challenge faced by security services is shown in the scale of social media use by IS Mr Wainwright revealed that IS is believed to have up to 50000 different Twitter accounts tweeting up to 100000 messages a day Europol is now setting up a European Internet Referral Unit to identify and remove sites being used by terrorist organisations Mr Wainwright also says current laws are deficient and should be reviewed to ensure security agencies are able to monitor all areas of the online world There is a significant capability gap that has to change if were serious about ensuring the internet isnt abused and effectively enhancing the terrorist threat We have to make sure we reach the right balance by ensuring the fundamental principles of privacy are upheld so

Copy link About sharing image copyright EPA image caption Mr Hannigans comments come amid a legal dispute between Apple and the FBI The head of GCHQ has called for greater cooperation between spies and tech companies in dealing with challenges posed by encryption Robert Hannigan said the encoding of data was being misused by a small number of people  He said the rational response was not to think encryption was bad but to look for pragmatic ways of responding  Mr Hannigan was speaking as the FBI  engages in a legal battle  with Apple over the firms encryption systems At an event at MIT in Boston Mr Hannigan director of the UK governments communications intelligence agency said it should be up to politicians  not companies or spies  to set the parameters On his first day in charge of GCHQ in November 2014 Mr Hannigan wrote an opinion piece for the Financial Times accusing US tech companies of becoming the command and control network of choice for terrorist groups   A year and a half later in Boston Mr Hannigan conceded the comments caused a bigger stir than he expected and said they were wrongly seen as an attack on the tech industry  The tone of his latest intervention was conciliatory focusing on the need for government agencies and companies to work together to find solutions  media caption What is encryption We need a new relationship between the tech sector academia civil society and government agencies We should be bridging the divide sharing ideas and building a constructive dialogue in a less highlycharged atmosphere he told the audience Vulnerability Apple has designed phones with strong encryption which made it impossible for the company to retrieve data for the state including in  the case of one of those involved in the San Bernadino attacks    The company and its supporters have stressed that creating any form of key for the government to unlock data would also create a vulnerability for hackers and others to exploit    Mr Hannigan did not mention Apple directly but emphasised the way in which GCHQ supported strong encryption because of the agencys role in protecting British data from hackers and other states  He also pointed to the agencys pioneering work such as that of Alan Turing in World War Two who worked not just on breaking codes but also on securing speech through encryption  image copyright AFP image caption Apples position on encryption is strongly supported by its customers and other tech firms Mr Hannigan said two previously secret papers from 1970 by James Ellis a leading GCHQ cryptographer were being declassified which showed the early work on developing what became the now widely used system of public key cryptography  That kind of innovation was what Mr Hannigan said he wanted to see today in dealing with the modern challenges surrounding encryption  The solution is not of course that encryption should be weakened let alone banned But neither is it true that nothing can be done without weakening encryption he said adding that it was wrong to see every attempt to tackle the misuse of encryption by criminals and terrorists as a backdoor   Mr Hannigan reiterated that the British government position  as set out in the new investigatory powers bill  would not outlaw the type of endtoend encryption which is at the heart of the row between Apple and the FBI   Drawing the boundaries Instead he said it will demand companies take reasonable and practical steps to provide data when demanded  Within the parameters set by legislation it should be possible for technical experts to sit down together and work out solutions to particular manifestations of the abuse of encryption  Such conversations were more common before  the Snowden revelations  officials say but since then companies have withdrawn and referred requests to their lawyers   The decision about where to draw the boundaries was not one for either the companies or the spies Mr Hannigan said but instead for lawmakers  It is not for me as an intelligence official and civil servant or for a law enforcement officer to make these broad judgements whether about the use of data in general or encryption in particular nor is it for tech company colleagues nor even for independent academics   Since the tradeoffs are for society as a whole it must surely be for elected representatives to decide the parameters of what is acceptable Antony Walker deputy chief executive of techUK an organisation which represents tech firms said the solution lay in government academia and industry working together  These are hugely complex issues he said This speech makes it very clear that there are no easy answers It is a realistic assessment of the tradeoffs that need to be made to secure our

online would be insecure be it emailing or shopping or banking They all rely on the principle that if you encrypt data using complex mathematics it is nighon impossible to crack If youre using

they couldnt image copyright Thinkstock image caption A locked phone is locked for everyone  including Apple and Google Thats bad some say There are a lot of technological capabilities that are available right now that make it exceptionally difficult both technically as well as legally for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need to uncover it said CIA director John Brennan at a security forum on Monday And I do think this is a time for particularly Europe as well as here in the United States for us to take a look and see whether or not there have been some inadvertent or intentional gaps that have been created in the ability of intelligence and security services to protect the people that they are asked to serve An opinion column in the New York Times  authored by Manhattans district attorney and the City of London Police commissioner said encryption blocks justice  In the piece published back in August they wrote about a murder near Chicago in which a father of six had been shot At the scene officers found two mobile phones But they were passcode locked Neither Google or Apple the phones ran their software could unlock the phones and therefore the data was inaccessible On behalf of crime victims the world over the opinion piece read we are asking whether this encryption is truly worth the cost After Paris Its an argument that can be made with more vigour than ever after the Paris attacks With access to communications the antiencryption advocates say we could perhaps stop these tragic events from occurring Thats a claim worth scrutinising Its early days in the investigation and no evidence has yet been offered to show that encrypted communications were used to organise the atrocity But given that much of the worlds population  from gossiping teenagers to dealmaking business people  are using encryption regularly its not a wild assumption to consider that the attackers were too image copyright Thinkstock image caption The attacks in Paris will energise calls for more access to communications data But technology industry is on the whole against the suggestion that law enforcement should have backdoors into popular services  the term given to a hidden way of circumventing the apps security A backdoor in the infosec world is the term given to a method in which a supposedly secure system can be accessed It could be a quirk in some code or a vulnerability in how a system communicates Whatever the weakness typically once backdoors are made public they are fixed Hackers make serious money by discovering backdoors and selling them on  often to government security services Many in law enforcement and government feel there should be a backdoor made just for those in authority to investigate and stop criminals and terrorists But some of techs most influential figures say that the notion of a secure secret backdoor is dangerously misguided  If any backdoor exists hackers will find it eventually It would mean data security for all of us not just criminals would evaporate No key The Edward Snowden leaks about mass surveillance changed the landscape in this debate dramatically Faced with user

Cook on turning over iMessages They quickly implemented changes that were essentially designed to put them in a position of being able to credibly say Listen even if we wanted to help we couldnt If the government laid a subpoena to get iMessages we cant provide it said Apple boss Tim Cook speaking last year to US public broadcaster PBS Its encrypted and we dont have a key And so its sort of  the door is closed For a company that is reluctant to say much about anything Apple is bullish on encryption At a dinner event earlier this year Mr Cook pressed home his view He said calls for intentional backdoors for government as an attack on civil liberties If you put a key under the mat for the cops he said A burglar can find it too Momentum But Silicon Valley companies are preparing themselves for a backlash against this attitude PostSnowden the Obama administration was compelled to rejig its rules over data gathering acknowledging that some of the actions of its security services were unconstitutional Great news for Silicon Valley and privacy advocates Gone is the wholesale collection of some types of data In its place a more selective means of data mining but crucially a backing off of trying to get Apple et al to back down on their views over encryption But after Paris we could see a shift in momentum A memo uncovered by the Washington Post sent three months ago by Robert Litt a lawyer working for the US National Intelligence office said that while attitudes towards creating government backdoors were hostile that atmosphere could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement  Paris may just be that event Offshore haven But if it is how effective would those suggested measures be  One of the apps being used extensively by socalled Islamic State is Telegram a secure messaging app founded by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov image copyright Telegram image caption Telegram is being used by IS to broadcast messages The app allows broadcast channels and my colleagues at BBC Monitoring logged that at least 4500 people were listening to ISs channel on Telegram Any US decision to force back doors into software wouldnt affect what Telegram does The company is based in Berlin Any attempt by European authorities would probably fall on deaf ears  the Durovs are no strangers to evading what they see as government meddling Pavel Durov founded VKontakte known now as VK a social network with the lions share of audience in Russia Its not unfair to call it a Facebook clone  it looks almost identical When Russian authorities wanted more access to the discussions on VK Pavel fled Telegram has repeatedly ignored the BBCs request for comment on this and other stories But on Instagram Pavel  made his feelings on the Paris attacks clear  I think the French government is as responsible as IS for this because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy he said They take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of shortsighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place In a comment posted to his profile on VKontakte Pavel  as quoted by the Moscow Times  mocked the suggestion his app should be blocked  I propose banning words he said Theres evidence to suggest that theyre being used by terrorists to communicate Weak The attitude displayed by Pavel Durov exposes proencryption advocates say the inherent flaw in the argument for allowing government access If Apple Google Facebook and others were compelled by law to introduce backdoors terrorists would probably just move as they have done already to other platforms with a more anarchistic approach It would leave services normal people use far less secure while dangerous people would be operating on systems that are even harder to gain access to with proprietors who are proudly antigovernment In the coming days statements from politicians and law enforcement will be made directed at the technology companies that handle our daytoday communications Theyll be forced to look cooperative while not undermining the promises they made after the Snowden revelations Put up against military or diplomatic action taking affirmative steps against communication apps may seem an easy win in the war against terrorism But like so many challenges the world faces  its simply

About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption The LogJam attack vulnerability could mean encrypted communications could still be spied upon Webbrowser makers are preparing a fix for a flaw in an encryption algorithm that makes it possible to spy on supposedly secure communications However the updates will mean a minority of websites will be blocked by the new software The  LogJam attack was discovered by researchers  at Microsoft and a number of US and French universities They believe about  8 of the top one million HTTPS securityprotected sites  are made vulnerable by the flaw Users would therefore be given false reassurance by the padlock icon that such sites display in a browsers address bar Some email servers and services that use the Transport Layer Security TLS cryptographic protocol are also at risk of being hacked until their operators update their systems Export controls The LogJam attack vulnerability is a legacy of the US 1990sera export restrictions on cryptographic tools These limited the complexity of the secret encryption codes that could be generated by international versions of USmade software including Netscapes web browser The export rules were later relaxed but the researchers say an unintended consequence is that a commonly used process called a DiffieHellman key exchange can be compromised by a maninthemiddle attack image copyright Thinkstock image caption The flaw allows hackers to make target systems use a weaker than desired encryption key A DiffieHellman key exchange was one of the first techniques developed to allow two or more parties to create and share an encryption key by exchanging parts of the key in public  What the researchers discovered was that by intercepting the communications a hacker could ensure a 512bit key was used rather than a more complicated one In this context 512bit means there are two to the power of 512 possible combinations  representing a huge number Nevertheless the researchers said it was still possible for computers to crack such codes in minutes Even more complicated types of encryption were susceptible to cyberspies using supercomputers at the National Security Agency they added In the 1024bit case we estimate that such computations are plausible given nationstate resources and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agencys attacks on VPNs virtual private networks are consistent with having achieved such a break they wrote Nevertheless the fix that webbrowser makers have agreed on is that their software should block 512bit or weaker encryption keys image caption Users may not be able to access some website after they upgrade their browser The solution is relatively simple  you disable this legacy function on your system said Prof Alan Woodward a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey Unfortunately some older web servers might then be prevented from starting a secure conversation with the updated web browsers as they would support only that older shorter weaker key lengths  But do you really want this backward compatibility if it means others could be forced to use this weaker form of encryption Browsers can be updated and servers can be reconfigured easily and it really is no bad thing to force this to happen bearing in mind the alternative is that a secure connection could potentially be broken by an eavesdropper According to a report by the Wall Street Journal  it has been estimated that 20000 websites could become blocked as a consequence Storm in a teacup Mozilla  which is responsible for the Firefox browser  said its new software should be released in the next few days image copyright Getty Images image caption The NSA is thought to be capable of breaking 1024bit encryption Most of the coordination in this case was done thanks to the researchers who found the bug They provided valuable measurement data to the various browser vendors which allowed us all to calibrate our response said Richard Barnes the organisations cryptographic engineering manager Another security expert said that internet users should not be worried about being unprotected in the meantime The fact that LogJam can only be exploited when hackers and targets are on the same network as well as patches being imminent means that hype around it is likely to be a bit of a storm in a teacup said Ross Brewer from security research company LogRhythm Organisations should however use flaws like this as an excuse to give themselves a security health check  With flaws like LogJam being identified with increasing frequency the only real way to know youre safe is to know you can stop an attack in its tracks as soon as it gets going More on this story Europol chief warns on encryption Published 29

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25670315|2014 The year of encryption By Paul Rubens Technology reporter Published 10 January 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption Companies are under pressure in the current environment to make sure their encryption is up to scratch The solution to government surveillance is to encrypt everything  So said Eric Schmidt Googles chairman in response to revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency NSA made by whistleblower  Edward Snowden  Schmidts advice appears to have been heeded by companies that provide internetbased services  Microsoft for instance says it will have bestinclass industry cryptography in place for services including Outlookcom Office 365 and SkyDrive by the end of the year while Yahoo has announced plans to encrypt all of its customers data including emails by the end of the first quarter of 2014 For many smaller businesses too 2014 is likely to be the year of encryption Thats certainly the view of Dave Frymier chief information security officer at Unisys a Pennsylvaniabased IT company  But he believes the driving force for this will be different not government surveillance programmes but the threat of attacks from hackers  Diamonds and paperclips Rather than encrypting everything Mr Frymier advocates that companies identify what he believes is the 515 of their data that is really confidential and use encryption to protect just that  He says employees should then be barred from accessing this data using standard desktop and laptop machines or their own smartphones or tablets which can easily be infected with malware Access would be restricted to employees using secure hardened computers image copyright other image caption Dave Frymier from Unisys says the threat posed by hackers will drive firms to invest in encryption When you look at the increasing sophistication of malware it becomes apparent that you need to establish highly protected enclaves of data The only way to achieve that is through modern encryption properly implemented says Mr Frymier  You can split your data into diamonds and paperclips and the important thing is to encrypt the diamonds and not to sweat the paperclips Prakash Panjwani a general manager at Marylandbased data protection company Safenet also believes that the large number of highprofile data breaches in 2013  including hacker attacks on  US retailer Target   software maker Adobe  and  photo messaging service Snapchat   means that 2014 will inevitably be a bumper one for encryption vendors  Snowden has focused attention on surveillance issues but the real threat is organised crime and the number of data breaches that are occurring he says  Companies are going to come under extreme pressure from boards customers and regulators in 2014 to take action so that if there is a data breach they can say We didnt lose any data because it was encrypted Keeping the regulator happy A large number of companies already use encryption to protect the data they store on their own systems at rest as well as data in flight as it is sent over networks to customers other data centres or for processing or storage in the cloud  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Using a longer encryption key will make it harder for hackers to access your data But Ramon Krikken an analyst at Gartner believes that the way encryption is used by many of these companies is likely to change in 2014  Companies are certainly going to have to take encryption more seriously thanks to the Snowden revelations he says  At the moment many companies are using encryption for compliance reasons not for security They are not using it to protect their data but because it is the easiest way to comply with regulations encryption is the auditors and the regulators favourite check box item Back doors One question that companies will need to consider is which encryption algorithm or cipher to use to best encrypt their data Its an important question as some older ciphers can now be cracked relatively quickly using the computing power in a standard desktop PC   And there is a question mark over whether the NSA may have deliberately used its influence to weaken some encryption systems  or even to introduce back doors that provide easy access to encrypted data to anyone who knows of their existence  The problem is that even if you can inspect the source code it is certainly not a given that you would be able to spot a back door Mr Krikken says  image copyright AFP image caption US whistleblower Edward Snowdens revelations have made companies take encryption more seriously He believes it is more important to establish where all the parts of an encryption solution come from  If you procure software or hardware from overseas from a country with a government which does not have your best interests at heart you need to remember that it may not be as secure as you think Mr Krikken says  So you have to decide who you trust and find out where the vendor gets all the parts of its product from Dont be cheap Another thing companies need to consider when they implement encryption is how strong the encryption should be Using a longer encryption key makes it harder for hackers or governments to crack the encryption but it also requires more computing power  But Robert Former senior security consultant for Neohapsis an Illinoisbased security services company says many companies are overestimating the computational complexity of encryption  If you have an Apple Mac your processor spends far more time making OS X looks pretty than it does doing crypto work He therefore recommends using encryption keys that are two or even four times longer than the ones many companies are currently using  I say use the strongest cryptography that your hardware and software can support I guarantee you that the cost of using your available processing power is less than the cost of losing your data because you were too cheap to make the crypto strong enough he says   Noone ever got fired for having encryption that was too strong  Related Internet Links Unisys Safenet

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27974877|Do quantum computers threaten global encryption systems By Mark Ward Technology correspondent BBC News Published 12 August 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright SPL The modern world is a house of cards built upon encryption Make a mobile phone call and encryption is there to stop eavesdroppers listening in Spend money online and encryption ensures your card number and identity cannot be scooped up and used elsewhere And the money that keeps global banking systems lubricated only does so thanks to cryptographic software that turns a stream of data into unintelligible nonsense  Remove all that encryption and the whole lot comes tumbling down If that happens we might return to an era when commerce was mostly done facetoface and based around who you know Scrambled Yet quantum computers  another modern marvel  are threatening to make this doomsday scenario a reality Why Because of the possibilities for massive parallelism says Prof Mark Manulis a cryptographic expert from the University of Surreys department of computing In other words because of a quantum computers potential ability to do trillions of calculations a second When a message is scrambled with a modern encryption system the keys used to lock it are typically very large numbers  tens if not hundreds of digits long  Finding that key means using a computer to carry out lots of sums and then trying each answer to see if it unlocks a message an attacker is interested in  image caption If encryption fails then we might return to a very different type of commerce The sheer number of possible answers lends protection because it would take centuries or longer to find the right key  Unless largescale quantum computers are commonplace says Prof Manulis Quantum computers can crank through those sums so fast because their basic building blocks known as qubits can be used to represent both a zero and a one at the same time By contrast the computational elements bits of the classical computers under our desks and on our laps represent either a zero or a one Not both The curious properties of the quantum realm mean that when those qubits work together you get a vast rise in computational power  hence the potential they have to speed things up find keys and crack codes  Number crunching  Most significantly affected by the arrival of quantum computers are the public key infrastructure PKI systems we use to establish secure channels of communication online Typically when you turn up at a website it is PKI that sets up the initial connection With that secure channel created different encryption systems that are much less susceptible to attack by quantum computers are used to protect data shuttling back and forth Public key cryptography is based on problems from number theory integer factorisation and discrete logarithms that will be broken once we have powerful quantum computers said Prof Manulis image copyright DWave image caption Canadian firm DWave sells a working quantum computer The key word here is once  But that once might be a long time coming believes Dr Stephan Ritter who studies quantum computers at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching Germany Quantum computers are not very powerful at the moment but they have this potential and thats what this is about he told the BBC  Experimentally I would say that we are at the stage where its not even clear which physical elements they will be made of Researchers have yet to agree on the best way to build these qubits and how to link them together So far Dr Ritter says only quantum computers with a small handful of qubits have been made  a long way from the hundreds and thousands needed to make it able to do useful work and do it quickly There are proofs of concept of these building blocks but they all have advantages or disadvantages so its unclear which will be the best as we go forward he says Controversial Despite what Dr Ritter sees as a lack of progress Canadian firm DWave will sell you a working quantum computer if you have 15m Â£89m to spare  The way it operates is controversial and its price suggests it will not be the widely available device that can crack all our codes Even when they are available says Dr Ritter we should not think of them as wonder machines that speed up any and every batch processing job or database search Purestever silicon in quantum fix image copyright NIST image caption US scientists have created a very pure form of silicon28 an essential component of a quantum computer They are good for very specific tasks he says but not everything is faster with a quantum computer and there will be many tasks you will not use one for at all  As a result we should have a few years yet to update and improve our encryption systems as research and development work on quantum computers continues Badly broken Thats just as well says Dr Tanja Lange a coding theory and cryptology expert from the Technical University of Eindhoven as it can take a long time for older encryption systems to be swapped out in favour of more secure alternatives  For instance she says it took five to six years to swap out the widely used MD5 data scrambling system once its weakness was demonstrated through a viable attack Timescales can stretch for systems already used widely in the field such as those found in cash machines smart cards and mobile phones However if a system is absolutely badly broken rollout can be faster she says RSA sent new tokens promptly after they had a breakin and credit card companies are used to replacing cards if there is a risk that they were compromised image copyright PA image caption Encryption ensures that noone can listen in to you while you walk and talk What will be harder she says is migrating everyone to the software systems that can resist attack by quantum computer At the very least such systems require much bigger encryption keys and that means they are much less efficient  for which read slower We hope that with another three to five years of research we can design systems that are smaller but were not there yet she says  Currently we can give you a tank with concrete enforcement  its secure but big We hope to find a way to give you a secure sports car with airbags ABS and all

January Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics US Capitol riots image copyright Getty Images Mass armed protests initially called for by some extreme Trump supporters in the leadup to inauguration day have so far not materialised following an apparent change of heart by the groups involved  One flyer shared on Gab a Twitterlike platform popular with farright groups had called for armed protests in Washington and 50 state capitals ahead of Joe Bidens inauguration The plans prompted a  warning from the FBI  But in recent days those calls have been reversed and a new theory put forward on fringe platforms  that plans for armed protests were instead a trap set up by the FBI or supporters of the leftwing Antifa or Black Lives Matter BLM groups Some of these discussions have been happening on less popular and less public online platforms where many Trump supporters from farright and conspiracy groups have migrated after being  kicked off Facebook and Twitter  in the wake of the Capitol riots on 6 January The vast majority of armed rallies that were initially being promoted have so far not gone ahead following the warnings  On Sunday despite earlier fears of violence there were only a few armed protesters in front of state capitols in several states including Michigan and Ohio Those who did turn out were not dedicated Trump supporters but mainly members of the extreme libertarian Boogaloo Bois movement whose followers advocate an armed overthrow of government  Who are the Boogaloo Bois A lone MAGA protester left his sign near the

Mr Biden will be inaugurated as president on Wednesday Although some claim they will never accept him as their president Alongside the new online warnings to avoid armed protests in Washington DC and elsewhere there are a few posts by furious supporters of the president calling for guerrilla warfare The lack of armed protests for now could be down to increased fear about crackdowns by law enforcement following the 6 January says Alex Newhouse research lead at the Center on Terrorism Extremism and Counterterrorism in the US He also warns of a different kind of threat from the Capitol riots The level of desensitisation to concepts like race war civil war and political violence that occurs in these chatrooms means that if even a tiny fraction of 1 of followers take it seriously that could indicate a higher potential of individual acts of extreme violence  image copyright Getty Images image caption Influential QAnon figures were among those who broke into the Capitol And what about the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory which has been blamed for radicalising so many and whose members were among those that stormed the Capitol  QAnon followers remain convinced that somehow Mr Trump with the help of the military will successfully overturn the outcome of the election on inauguration day What is QAnon They believe Mr Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act a rarely used 1807 law that allows the president to deploy military forces inside the US There is no evidence to suggest this could happen  Followers of the conspiracy have also been sharing false or doctored images and videos of the fencing around the Capitol building  built to ensure the safety of those attending the inauguration and avoid a repeat of the 6 January riots  with claims the fencing is in fact a military prison which will be used to entrap Mr Biden and members of the socalled deep state Who are Proud Boys and antifa The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol   Theres also an increasing sense of paranoia Groups on alternative platforms that openly called for violence on 6 January now worry aloud that they have been infiltrated by government agents or leftwing activists  Owners and

close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Artwork The ambitious target is to have an initial service by 2024 and a full service by 2027 The European Commission says it wants its newly proposed satellite megaconstellation to be offering some sort of initial service in 2024 The first priority is to fill in gaps in broadband coverage where ground infrastructure cannot reach but later it will power services such as selfdriving cars  The project will in some ways mirror Americas Starlink and the UKIndian OneWeb networks Its scope has yet to be fully defined  A consortium of aerospace and telecoms companies is doing that right now But EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said he wanted to get going on the idea as soon as possible My objective is to go fast And therefore it would be appropriate that the Commission puts forward this year a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council so we can move concretely  he told the 13th European Space Conference  on Tuesday To be ready we launched a few weeks ago a study on a secure spacebased connectivity system The selected consortium consisting of European satellite manufacturers operators and service providers telco operators and launch service providers will study the possible design and development of this project This will provide insights on the technical dimension but also the governance structure the financing the missions the exact scope I expect their first feedback in April this year Elon Musks Starlink given green light in UK OneWeb satellite

business The secure communications system would be the next flagship space project to come out of the EU after the Galileo satellitenavigation constellation and the Copernicus programme with its Earth observing Sentinel spacecraft EU officials have only spoken in the broadest terms about what they want to see from the new telecommunications project  They talk about a mix of low medium and geostationary satellites that use advanced quantum encryption are interlinked with optical connectors and which piggyback sensors that might also be used to monitor aviation and shipping  just as examples But they argue fast secure lowlatency spaceborne connectivity will be the musthave capability to enable a raft of coming technologies such as selfdriving cars   Europe needs such a capability if it wants to stay globally competitive  The primary motivation in the first instance however would be to fill those last not spots in member states where ground infrastructure is incapable of delivering broadband services  thought to be at least five million households image copyright EC image caption Breton A proposal to the European Parliament and the Council by the years end Pressed on cost EU officials told reporters on Tuesday that any estimate would have to wait on the industrial consortiums report in the spring Nonetheless experience says it would be in the billions of euros price bracket And as to where the money will come from to make it all happen the preferred option seems to be some sort of publicprivate partnership The officials said the commission had some funds across its various directorates that it could call on but that they expected industry individual member states and the European Space Agency to invest in the system as well Whatever the system looks like and however it is funded speed of implementation will be paramount  The Starlink broadband megaconstellation which is being built by US entrepreneur Elon Musks SpaceX company has already started offering beta or trial broadband connections in Northern Europe and OneWeb owned by Indian conglomerate Bharti Global and the British government hopes to have an initial offering for its Northern European customers later this year From the first idea about Galileo through to the first operational service in Europe it has taken 20 years we dont have 20 years for this new project observed JeanMarc Nasr the head of Airbus Space Systems which leads the feasibility consortium Speed is of the essence here The idea of the European space infrastructure has been on the table since early 2020 We cannot have the first service in 2040 If we do that we are dead  We have to have the service operational at the end of this decade at the latest And this requires all of us to work as a team to deliver the best competitive service and technical background to Europe image copyright ESA image caption Artwork It took two decades to get the Galileo system fully up and running There is talk of having the entire network in place by the end of the new EU multiannual budget period which is 2027  One issue of supreme importance for the implementation of the network will be securing the radio frequencies on which it will operate as pointed out by Riadh Cammoun vice president of public and regulatory affairs at the FrancoItalian satellite manufacturer Thales Alenia Space We need funding we need a vision we need leadership but also we need frequency rights to sustain the launch of a European lowEarth orbit constellation he told the conference The commission said it had been working for some months already to try to secure those frequencies The allocation and use of satellite frequencies is negotiated through the International Telecommunications Union ITU   Related Topics Space

link About sharing image caption Encryption helps to ensure that credit card transactions stay secure Encryption makes the modern world go round Every time you make a mobile phone call buy something with a credit card in a shop or on the web or even get cash from an ATM encryption bestows upon that transaction the confidentiality and security to make it possible If you consider electronic transactions and online payments all those would not be possible without encryption said Dr Mark Manulis a senior lecturer in cryptography at the University of Surrey  At its simplest encryption is all about transforming intelligible numbers or text sounds and images into a stream of nonsense  There are many many ways to perform that transformation some straightforward and some very complex Most involve swapping letters for numbers and use maths to do the transformation However no matter which method is used the resulting scrambled data stream should give no hints about how it was encrypted  During World War II the Allies scored some notable victories against the Germans because their encryption systems did not sufficiently scramble messages Rigorous mathematical analysis by Allied code crackers laid bare patterns hidden within the messages and used them to recreate the machine used to encrypt them Those codes revolved around the use of secret keys that were shared among those who needed to communicate securely These are known as symmetric encryption systems and have a weakness in that everyone involved has to possess the same set of secret keys  In the modern era a need has arisen to communicate securely with people and organisations we do not know and with whom we cannot easily share secret keys said Dr Manulis This need has given rise to publickey cryptography Despite the formidable name it encapsulates a simple idea  image caption Wartime codecracking machines such as Colossus broke German encryption systems Essentially it allows anyone to send a message that only one person or company or website or gadget can unlock It does this using two keys one public one private The public key is used to lock a message Anyone can get hold of that public key but once a message is locked with it that message can only be opened with the corresponding private key  Typically these keys are large numbers and the security of the system depends on the fact that some mathematical operations are easier than others  For instance it is far easier to multiply numbers together public key and plain text message to get a result than it is to start with that result the scrambled message and work backwards Complicated mathematics guarantees that the right private key will unscramble a message Far harder even for the fastest computer is starting with that result the scrambled message and searching through all the possible combinations of numbers that could produce it Because of the size of the keys is so huge its impossible for an attacker to search through the key space with the resources they usually have he said Such brute force attacks are pretty much doomed no matter how much computer power attackers bring to bear he said  Typically the numbers used in these mathematical encryption systems are tens if not hundreds of digits long This makes it impossible to all intents and purposes to search through all potential keys in a reasonable amount of time The web and many other modern communication systems employ a hybrid approach said Dr Manulis because public key encryption is not very computationally efficient compared to symmetric key encryption image caption Even supercomputers would not break the strongest encryption algorithms On the web the relatively slower public key cryptography is used initially to establish a secure connection between you and a website The symmetric system would be no good for this step because there is no way to securely swap the secret key However with a secure channel in place the faster symmetric system can be used to share a key and then scramble the data passing back and forth  On mobiles a similar system is used and encryption keys are held on a handsets sim card to help keep chatter scrambled  Vulnerabilities Attacks on these encryption systems take many forms said Dr Manulis  You do not need to break the communication system if you have some spy software on the end point he said In addition weaknesses have been found in the software used to encapsulate them on computers and phones  The algorithms are mathematically proven he said  and if theres any problem then it usually comes in the implementation of the algorithm In addition there have been suggestions that the NSA has subverted the process of creating encryption algorithms to make them easier for it to break Official agencies can also force firms be they websites or mobile operators to surrender their private keys so they can eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications Some have sought to get make encryption more secure by using a technique known as endtoend encryption  This differs from more standard systems which can be vulnerable because their scrambling system is in software terms separate from the program used to create a message  If attackers insert themselves between the message making software and the encryption system at either end of a conversation they will see information before it is scrambled Endtoend encryption closes this gap by having the message making software apply the scrambling directly In addition many of these systems run a closed network so messages never travel over the public internet and are only decrypted when they reach their intended recipient image caption Some fear that sending data over public networks makes it more susceptible to surveillance Related

link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright AFP image caption The UK Cabinet has been meeting via Zoom  something researchers say may not be ideal The hugely popular video meetings app Zoom has significant weaknesses which might make it unsuitable for secrets A team at The Citizen Lab found that Zoom was using a nonstandard type of encryption and transmitting information through China Government use  such as Boris Johnsons use of the app for Cabinet meetings  may not be wise the researchers warned But the app is fine for keeping in touch for most people they said Until recently Zoom was used mainly by large businesses for video conference calls But the explosion in users during the coronavirus pandemic has created a new gold rush for cyberspies The Citizen Labs report said It warned that Zoom may not be suitable for Governments and businesses worried about espionage Healthcare providers handling sensitive patient information Activists lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics But for people using Zoom for contacting friends holding social events or organising courses or lectures our findings should not necessarily be concerning the report said Analysis Still fine for most By Joe Tidy Cybersecurity Reporter Zoom says there are now 200 million meetings held on it every day and despite the serious flaws uncovered in this latest report its probably safe to say that 199 million of them are not in danger  The Citizen Lab has shown compelling evidence here that it is possible to collect all the data of a video meeting and then partially unscramble it to find out roughly what was said and what was seen  UK government defends PMs use of Zoom Zoom is in everyones living room  how safe is it However it would take a huge amount of time and effort for a hacker to achieve this  and it simply wouldnt be worth the effort for an average work huddle or friendly pub quiz held on the service Its the highlevel talks at company board level or in government that will be targeted  The government has been led by the National Cyber Security Centre and other security experts on this since the beginning The goal has always been to allow for open and smooth communications to take place but this research may well lead to the advice on Zoom changing fast  Zoom has made the classic mistake of designing and implementing their own encryption scheme rather than using one of the existing standards for encrypting voice and video content said Bill Marczak a Research Fellow at The Citizen Lab To be sure Zooms encryption is better than none at all but users expecting their Zoom meetings to be safe from espionage should think twice before using the app to discuss sensitive information The research has not taken the security services in the UK by surprise and it is understood that a project is working at pace to adapt existing communication systems to the demands of home working and security The UKs National Cyber Security Centre issued a statement saying Zoom is being used to enable unclassified crisis COVID19 communications in the current unprecedented circumstances Assured services are in place for more sensitive communications and the provision of these services is being widened given the demands of much greater remote working The government is not disclosing which meetings are eligible for Zoom and which ones are not As an example the BBC was told that Zoom is safe for Cabinetlevel discussions but not for emergency Cobra meetings  A Chinese heart for the US company Aside from the encryption standards the researchers also found that Zoom sends traffic to China  even when all the people in a Zoom meeting are outside of China During multiple test calls in North America we observed keys for encrypting and decrypting meetings transmitted to servers in Beijing China the report said image copyright EPA image caption Zoom remains hugely popular despite the concerns expressed in some quarters The report also pointed to the strong involvement of Chinese firms in the company Zoom has its headquarters in the US but has about 700 employees across three companies in mainland China working on the apps development Zoom apologises for security issues promises fixes Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars Running development out of China likely saves Zoom having to pay Silicon Valley salaries reducing their expenses and increasing their profit margin However this arrangement could also open up Zoom to pressure from Chinese authorities the report said A roll your own approach The team said there are mixed and confusing messages around the type of encryption that Zoom actually uses In some places it tells users that it uses endtoend encryption  the gold standard for secure messaging which makes it impossible for the service or any other middlemen to access data In its documentation Zoom has said it uses a type of encryption called AES256  But the researchers said this is not true Instead Zoom has rolled their own encryption  using a variant of something called AES128 in ECB mode Among security researchers ECB mode is well understood to be a bad idea because it preserves some of the patterns of the original  the report said  image copyright Wikimedia image caption The report highlighted that ECB mode preserves patterns and is a bad idea The report also says that Zoom does not use endtoend encryption as most people understand the term Instead it uses transport encryption between devices and servers Because Zoom does not implement true endtoend encryption they have the theoretical ability to decrypt and monitor Zoom calls the report said But it noted that Zoom itself has already addressed this concern promising that they have never built such a mechanism even if it is theoretically possible During their research the team was able to extract a still image from a video meeting using the encryption key Zoom clarified its encryption policy  on 1 April apologising for incorrectly suggesting that meetings were capable of endtoend encryption It also moved to quell fears about privacy and security issues promising to spend the next 90 days exclusively working on  trust safety and privacy issues Alan Woodward a professor of computer science at Surrey University told the BBC that a major fix is needed  I dont believe this is something that Zoom can just add to their list of jobs to do in the next 90 days Its possible but this requires a reengineering of the way they encrypt their calls so its a major undertaking  Prof

image copyright Reuters image caption Some prodemocracy protesters have already been arrested under Hong Kongs new security law Facebook WhatsApp Twitter Google and Telegram have all said they are pausing cooperation with requests for user information from the Hong Kong police Several countries have criticised China for imposing a new security law which they say threatens the territorys longstanding autonomy The announcements are likely to put pressure on Apple to do likewise While the others services are blocked in mainland China Apples are not However Facebook Google and Twitter do generate revenue from selling advertising to Chinese clients Apple complied with the majority of requests it received from Hong Kongs government between January and June before the new law came into effect  according to the firms latest transparency report  Microsoft  which has  also previously handed over data about its users to Hong Kongs authorities  and maintains a significant presence in mainland China  has not announced a change in policy either The BBC has asked the two companies for comment Right of privacy Chat app Telegram  headquartered in London  was first to announce plans to halt cooperation We understand the right of privacy of our Hong Kong users  the firm told the Hong Kong Free Press on Sunday  Accordingly Telegram does not intend to process any data requests related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached in relation to the ongoing political changes in the city Facebook followed saying it would stop considering the requests pending further assessment of the human rights issues No personal information about users in the region was held at or disclosed from its Hong Kong office it added We believe freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and support the right of people to express themselves without fear for their safety or other repercussions Facebook said China warns UK over Hong Kong interference Why Huaweis days in the UK could be numbered WhatsApp  which is owned by Facebook  said it believes in the right for people to have a private conversation online and we remain committed to providing private and secure messaging services to our users in Hong Kong Both platforms are blocked in mainland China but have benefited from Hong Kongs much broader access to the internet under its freedoms as a special administrative region  Google said it paused production on any new data requests when the new rules came into effect last week Well continue to review the details of the new law a spokeswoman told the BBC Twitter said it acted likewise What does Facebook give to police image copyright Getty Images WhatsApp has endtoend encryption enabled by default  so it cannot read or share with police officers messages sent between two users On Facebook Messenger however encryption is not the default option  it has to be manually switched on by users Both platforms  say they may disclose user data  in accordance with the law of the country in question But WhatsApp adds successful requests for this information must meet internationally recognised standards including human rights due process and the rule of law media caption What is encryption In the US both platforms require a subpoena to provide basic subscriber records such as the persons name IP internet protocol address and email address  Extra information about the subscriber may require a court order And a search warrant is needed for account contents On Facebook that includes messages photos videos posts and location information  On WhatsApp it means profile photos contacts lists and group information Hong Kong formerly a British territory was handed back to China in 1997 on the condition it would enjoy special freedoms for 50 years The UK says China has now broken that agreement and is  offering citizenship to as many as three million Hong Kong residents  Meanwhile the United States  where most of the tech firms involved are headquartered  is  considering whether to remove Hong Kongs favourable trading terms  The security laws  introduce new crimes including conspiring with foreigners to provoke hatred of the Chinese

sharing media caption Wikileaks cofounder Julian Assange responds to a BBC question about why it provides encrypted files for download Video courtesy of the journalists organisation Frontline Club A novel use of encryption by whistleblowing website Wikileaks could challenge the legal system for years to come according to an influential observer of the hacking community  Emmanuel Goldstein editor of 2600 The Hacker Quarterly magazine made his comments in reference to an encrypted file recently posted on the site Some suspect the file  as yet unopened  contains further sensitive material It has been reposted around the web and is available for anyone to download So far it has beeen downloaded 100000 times  If you release it in encrypted form nobody really knows if youve released it or not  or even what the material is Mr Goldstein told BBC News  Then if something happens to you all it takes is the revelation of a simple spoken phrase known by a select group of people and everyone who has this mystery file now has all of the secrets Uncrackable file Wikileaks recently published 76000 secret US military logs detailing military actions in Afghanistan an act the US authorities described as highly irresponsible The website now says it will release 15000 further sensitive documents once it has completed a review aimed at minimising the risk that the release could put peoples lives in danger The site came under criticism after it released the first tranche for endangering the lives of informants or others named in the documents  The release of the logs has led many to wonder what action the US might take against Wikileaks Now it seems the site may be using encryption as insurance against legal and other threats to the information it holds The insuranceaes256 file has been posted alongside the already published leaked war logs and can be downloaded by anyone  image caption Some have speculated that the insurance file is another video From the file name it is believed that it has been encrypted using the AES256 algorithm  described as extremely strong by Professor Whitfield Diffie of the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway University London Prof Diffie believes that AES256 which he says has been extensively studied could prove too tough even for US intelligence agencies to break While noone knows what the insurance file contains this has not prevented the contents becoming a matter of considerable speculation Some suspect that the file contains a further leaked US military video others that it is another tranche of US military logs  perhaps this time from Iraq Or it could  just be an imaginative bluff Even the name of the directory in which it is held  strawglassandbottle  has prompted discussion and debate online Historical value Speaking at a recent event at Londons Frontline Club Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told attendees how the use of encryption could help overcome legal efforts to prevent publication Mr Assange told the BBC that Wikileaks had often distributed encrypted material among its members in order to protect it We have over a long period of time distributed encrypted backups of material we have yet to release he told the gathering All we have to do is release the password to that material and it is instantly available he said By publishing the encrypted documents publicly Mr Assange said Wikileaks was protecting material of historical value That duty to history is something that weighs heavily with us If you had the Stasi archive in your pocket that is a very heavy pocket indeed he said We take precautions to make sure that sort of material is not going to disappear from history regardless of the sort of threats to this organisation Intelligence test But with the insurance file Wikileaks has taken the unusual step of making an encrypted backup  if that is indeed what it is  publicly available online Emanuel Goldstein told the BBC Julian is smart He always has a backup which is the rule of thumb in this community But he believes this goes further than just a need to preserve information image caption Wikileaks has come under criticism for its most recent leaks Its a fascinating tactic and one which will challenge the legal system for years to come In Mr Goldsteins view any attempt now to seize or prevent publication of material held by Wikileaks will be selfdefeating because thousands of copies will already have been distributed world wide It is he says a tactic of intelligence to ward off the inevitable clampdown But Cindy Cohn legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is less convinced the file represents a challenge to the US government I dont see it as a challenge as much as being open about whats going on she told the BBC In Ms Cohns view the idea of circulating encrypted copies of information to keep it safe is wellestablished The tactic according to Ms Cohn has been used in the past by human rights groups and other organisations She points to projects like Freenet which use encryption and wide distribution of data to resist censorship Wikileaks is doing the same basic thing in a more directly political context and using encryption to allow them to be more open about it on the front end For Prof Diffie the release of information in this way does open up interesting possibilities In a sense communications networks can be defined entirely by who has cryptographic keys and I think a lot of networks will work that way in the future Thats a view which will not be good news for those trying to prevent groups sharing and publishing leaked material I think that the people who are trying to shut down Wikileaks are going to have to accept this as a fact of reality that cryptography allows you to do

Warrington living room in lockdown  Thomas Maher originally from Ireland has been sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to more than 14 years in jail after pleading guilty to drugs and moneylaundering charges  He made thousands of pounds a week using an encrypted Encrochat phone to fix the movement of drugs and money  He is the first major crime boss jailed using messages obtained when French police cracked the Encrochat network The phones were considered mandatory for highend organised crime and more than a thousand suspects have been arrested on the strength of the evidence their messages contain  Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Encrypted mobile cracked to convict drug dealer Maher 39 used the Encrochat handles Satirical and Snacker as he did deals with organised crime networks in the UK Ireland Denmark the Netherlands Spain Turkey and Bulgaria   The National Crime Agency says he was hugely influential among Europes drug cartels  Sentencing him Judge Aubrey QC said Maher was a highranking facilitator a gobetween for criminal networks needing to transport their drugs between Holland and Ireland   Passing a sentence of 14 years and eight months the judge told Maher You were an extremely important cog in the wheel of a sophisticated network Maher would arrange for lorries to move massive loads of drugs hidden alongside legitimate cargoes such as fruit or wine in one direction and then to bring cash in the other direction  image copyright NCA image caption The NCA kept Maher under surveillance after French police passed on details of his activities Police found out about his operation after he was arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants while they were being transported to the UK in October 2019 He had previously owned the trailer in which they were found   The NCA put him under surveillance in an attempt to identify the scale of his criminal activities However the cracking of the Encrochat network by French intelligence and the Gendarmerie provided the National Crime Agency with thousands of his encrypted messages  They were able to watch almost in real time as he did deals with crime bosses around Europe  image copyright NCA Martin Clark from the NCA said he posed as an honest haulier but was in fact very much a professional facilitator and hes done it all remotely sitting in his living room Hes never personally been anywhere near any of it In fact the NCA said he had been scrupulous about social distancing during the pandemic while communicating via Encrochat with dozens of criminals  The evidence the agency has uncovered shines a new light on the way in which a smuggling network operates  Maher would be contacted by clients wanting to move hundreds of kilos of drugs  The messages were written in criminal slang He would discuss deals involving shipments of tops top shelf drugs such as cocaine or Colo the purest form from Colombia  Heroin which he deemed a more downmarket drug was known as bottoms  Shipments might come from The Flat The Netherlands and the lorry returned with paper cash  Decoding the criminals  Officers working on Encrochat cases are having to develop skills in understanding the slang suspects are using in their messages  In this message Thomas Maher Satirical is telling an alleged coconspirator that theyre not doing too badly despite the lockdown Helpfully for police he sets out the network of drug transportation routes he is currently operating  Taxi ways are working out OK at the minute with this fella from flat to ours and Belgium to ours am other thats two  and plus a driver with redacted for Polys sun to flat and we still have redacted turk to flat and and his men redacted to here where I am Once we get this travel ban lifted m8 we be on the pigs bk that alone is a lot of taxi plus we have the receiver here from Asia so m8 we have a lot more than others thats why Im not stressing yet The police translation reads  Our HGV drug courier business is working out OK at the moment Someone is bringing shipments from Holland and Belgium to the UK Theres a driver for ecstasy from Spain to Holland and we still have Turkey to Holland and redacted is bringing shipments to the UK Once the travel ban is lifted we will be doing rather well That alone is a lot of shipments plus we have someone bringing drugs in from

communicate in code Crucial evidence was obtained from pictures on his phone His drivers would photograph the shipments to prove they had been picked up  They would sometimes use a token during the handover  This involved showing a particular Euro bank note with digits previously agreed as evidence of identity  When Maher was moving drugs he would earn around Â£3500 each time For money transported for laundering in consignments of 300000 euros at a time he would skim 1 of the total as his payment Luxury watches He was always showing Â£50 notes in the pub Martin Clark said and people were suspicious that he was a criminal Maher lived in a fairly modest Cheshire home but police surveillance spotted luxury cars including a Range Rover Porsche Cayenne Mercedes GLS and Corvette parked on the drive  When they raided his house they found evidence he had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on Rolex and Hublot watches   He had taken holidays in Dubai Mexico and New York where he

Twitter Published 13 March Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Christies Images LtdBeeple Mike Winkelmann is an American graphic designer In May 2007 he drew an image of his Uncle Joe called it Uber Jay Mikes nickname for his uncle and shared it online The next day he made another image and once again posted it online He did the same thing the next day and then the next day  In fact every day for the past 13 years Mike has uploaded a new image You can see them on his Instagram feed beeplecrap  Beeple being his nom de plume when in graphic artist mode  Initially it was a good way for him to market his skills to internet savvy clients including Apple Nike CocaCola Louis Vuitton and a host of pop stars from Justin Bieber to Katy Perry  It turned out people liked Beeple  His Instagram following grew and grew like Jacks beanstalk reaching the heady heights of 19 million today  His images became weirder and grosser his words as time went on and he learnt to use 3D technology  Nowadays his everydays have a scifi comic book look They are often responding to the news agenda or riffing on pop culture and are typically set in postapocalyptic futuristic landscapes Some take him minutes to make other a few hours  image copyright Christies Images LtdBeeple image caption Home Planet image copyright Christies Images LtdBeeple image caption Boat Parade His rule is one a day I tell you this because Mike has had a big week  When Covid struck and his design business work slowed down he started to explore the mindboggling world of cryptocurrencies blockchains and Nonfungible tokens NFTs which are basically digital certificates of ownership He discovered that there were some serious players in the virtual game serious players who would pay serious money for a piece of digital art that came with an NFT that authenticated it as unique  Mike changed his focus from Winkelmann the designer to Beeple the artist  And then he had an ideaâ¦ He created a collage of all the everyday images he had produced over the years and called it Everydays The First 5000 Days  image copyright Christies Images LtdBeeple image caption Tom Hanks beating Coronavirus He partnered with the auction house Christies which had never sold a purely digital work before an artwork that didnt exist in the real life but belonged in a virtual world They created an online auction for the work that lasted for two weeks and started the bidding at 100  The price slowly started to creep up then it began to accelerate before going stratospheric in the final minutes where it was increasing in increments of well over 1 million The winning bid was 60 million which when all the extra charges were added left the purchaser with a bill of 69 million  That is a lot of money for an encrypted Jpeg  Nobody could believe the sum paid  Not Christies not art market specialists and not Beeple theres a nice video on the Christies website that shows him watching  the final minutes of the auction  Frankly I dont get it either  It doesnt make any sense to me  But then nor did someone paying 450 million to buy Salvator Mundi in 2017 an overrestored wreck of a painting that some  but not all  experts attribute to Leonardo da Vinci or da Vinci and his studio  image copyright Christies image caption The 450 million sale of Salvator Mundi broke the record for any work of art sold at auction So best to put money aside and consider Everydays The First 5000 Days as a work of visual art and not as a tradeable commodityfinancial investment  Is it any good Yes is the short answer  If youre into the comic book aesthetic which can be traced back decades then Beeple is a talented exponent of the genre  Its not too much of a stretch to make a reference to Hieronymus Boschs 15th Century densely weird masterpieces or Andy Warhols Pop Art or the macabre nature of Philip Gustons surreal cartoonish paintings of the late 1960s and 70s  image copyright Alamy  image caption Confrontation by Philip Guston who was known for his cartoonishstyle of paintings and drawings image copyright Alamy image caption Andy Warhol was famously inspired by familiar images from consumer culture image copyright Christies Images LtdBeeple image caption Vibe City by Beeple shows how he draws on consumer culture too The main difference being Beeple is making his images using a different technique a different medium and different materials he is a 21st Century artist whose time has come in part because of the digital lives we are living because of the pandemic The speed at which he works is not uncommon in the history of art nor are the subjects he addresses It is reasonable to compare him to other artists Although in the context of fine art rather than graphic design his images lack the psychological intensity you find in the paintings of say Jennifer Packer  whose exhibition at the Serpentine Gallery in London  I reviewed recently  Beeples artworks read to me more like a comedians oneliner than a novel captured in a picture which is what the greatest artists are able to achieve   image copyright Christies Images LtdBeeple image caption Mike Winkelmann aka Beeple is now one of the top three most valuable living artists There is also an issue about the work and the blockchain technology being used to give it value which should not be overlooked Digital art might not exist in the real world but it sure does it some real environmental harm The energy intensive tech used to create and store cryptoart a line of code  metadata  that traces back to an image is exactly what the world doesnt need right now computers whirring away day and night to generate NFTs consume huge amounts of energy  Should that be a consideration when viewing the work  I think so  it is part of the work insomuch as it is the reason for the astronomical price that was paid to own its NFT  Everydays The First 5000 Days will go down in history either as the moment before the shortlived cryptoart bubble burst or as the first chapter in a new story of art I wont pretend to have viewed each and every image but I have seen enough to know it is of artistic and documentary merit Recent reviews by

in compliance over the past two days China passed the law on 30 June  criminalising acts that support independence making it easier to punish protesters Apple says it is assessing the rules If the tech firms make their noncompliance policies permanent they could face restrictions or a ban on their services in the semiautonomous region And while Facebook Google Twitter and Telegrams services are blocked in mainland China the same is not true of Microsoft Zoom and Apple In a related development TikTok  which is owned by the Chinese firm Bytedance  has said it plans to exit Hong Kong within days  The business had previously  said it would not comply with Chinese government requests  to access TikTok users data It operates a similar service called Douyin in its home market which could theoretically become a substitute However Bytedance has indicated it does not have plans to do so at this time Seeking guidance Microsoft directly offers its Office 365 work app and LinkedIn social networks to both Hong Kong residents and citizens in mainland China But while Office 365 is provided directly by the firm to Hong Kong residents the service is run  by a local firm 21Vianet  on the other side of the border allowing Microsoft to remain one step removed In the case of LinkedIn law enforcement data requests have to go via the US government  although the division says it does sometimes  make an exception in an emergency According to Microsofts latest transparency report it received requests for data linked to 81 accounts from Hong Kongs government between July and December 2019  and provided noncontent data in most cases  As we would with any new legislation we are reviewing the new law to understand its implications said a spokesman for the American firm In the past
