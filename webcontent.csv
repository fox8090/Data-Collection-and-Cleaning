Mr Campbell said: ""This is not the first time that my life has been put under threat by republicans, and the challenge now is whether those who supported the threats in the past will condemn those who do it now.  ""If they do, it is an indication that we have indeed moved on.""  He added: ""I will not be dictated to or deflected by terrorists.""

Speaking earlier, Mr Robinson claimed Mr Campbell's words were ""a bit of comedy"" in the middle of the conference.

Emil Apreda, 33, sent emails from Berlin demanding Â£10m worth of Bitcoin to not carry out the attacks. The National Crime Agency said he made his threats in the spring and summer of 2020 as the NHS struggled with Covid. Senior officers kept the threats from the public for fear of patients being scared into not attending hospitals.  Apreda used encryption techniques and the dark web in an attempt to hide his identity, but police brought in behavioural, linguistics and cyber-crime experts to track him down.  He sent emails to the NHS pretending to be a far-right activist linked to the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, but police believe that was just a ruse to instil fear.  He was finally identified by German detectives and armed officers raided his home in Berlin on 15 June last year.  UK facing 'nasty mix' of threats, says MI5 chief Pandemic 'exposes' UK security planning gaps 'Heightened anxiety' For the first time, the NCA has revealed details of the case, calling it ""one of the most significant threats we've seen for some time"" which took place at a time of ""deep and heightened anxiety"" in the UK.  Tim Court, the NCA's head of investigations, said the content of the emails was ""so threatening and so damaging"" that it was only disclosed to a ""very tight circle of people - and I mean very tight"" within the police and government.  Meanwhile, security at hospitals was quietly stepped up.  Mr Court said the risks were both of loss of life and a loss of confidence in the NHS.  ""At the height of this, we were losing nearly nearly 1,000 people a day - and for six weeks we're trying to manage somebody who could have been planting a bomb in a hospital, somewhere in the UK."" A particular concern was that many patients were on ventilators or oxygen at the time, and it would have been more difficult to get them out of a hospital in the event of a credible bomb threat.   The extortion campaign started on 26 April when Apreda sent an email to the NHS, making his demand for Bitcoin and warning that he would send a bomb in a package to a hospital in the UK if he was not paid.  This was followed by an identical email to an NCA control centre, followed by 16 more over six weeks.  During that period, the death of George Floyd in the US and resulting protests in the UK prompted threats from him to blow up Black Lives Matter demonstrations.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Threats were also made against Black Lives Matter protests Finally, as the fourth anniversary of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right activist approached, he emailed that he would kill MPs - but did not name any. Police behavioural and linguistics experts drew up a profile of the extortionist, who they decided was not from the UK.  Police say further ""technical leads"" pointed to Germany. He was finally identified by LKA, the German CID. image copyright PA image caption Jo Cox was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen Apreda had been issuing deadlines for payment after which he said he would attack, so the day before the anniversary of Ms Cox's death, German police moved in, blowing open the front door of his Berlin flat and arresting him.  Police say he has background in computing, but they have discovered no links to Combat 18, despite his claims.  The far-right group has been active in the UK in the past, but now exists mainly in the US and Germany. Apreda was charged and convicted of extortion in Germany, but the NCA said he could have faced terrorism charges if he had been brought to the UK.  The NCA  said he had no links that they could find with Britain, and therefore extraditing him had not been possible. It denied Brexit had been a major factor.

LGBT+ rights have become the single biggest cultural issue in Poland's election campaign ahead of Sunday's vote. In the eyes of Jaroslaw Kaczynski's national-conservative party and the Catholic Church, those rights are a threat to traditional Polish families and values. Mr Kaczynski likes to identify threats to Polish society - during the election campaign four years ago, he said Middle Eastern migrants might bring ""parasites and protozoa"" to Poland. This time around, according to Mr Kaczynski, the threat comes from LGBT+ people and from Europe, where families can have ""two mummies or two daddies"", he said. image copyright Getty Images image caption Jaroslaw Kaczynski has highlighted Poland's Catholic heritage in focusing on LGBT+ issues Poland's 1997 constitution states that a marriage is between a man and a woman . Civil partnerships, be they between heterosexual or same-sex couples, are not legally recognised. ""Christianity is part of our national identity, the [Catholic] Church was and is the preacher and holder of the only commonly held system of values in Poland,"" he said. ""Outside of itâ¦ we have only nihilism."" Senior Catholic Church figures have gone further, most notably the Archbishop of Krakow, Marek Jedraszewski, who on numerous occasions has identified the ""LGBT lobby"" and ""gender ideology"" as the new threat to Polish freedom following the end of communism in 1989, calling it ""totalitarian"" and a ""great threat to our freedom"".  Where Poland's main political groups stand on same-sex marriage Law and Justice (PiS):  Opposes civil partnerships, same sex marriage and adoption of children by same sex couples Citizen's Coalition (KO) : Supports introduction of civil partnerships only Left Coalition : Supports introduction of marriage equality Polish People's Party (PSL), Kukiz'15 (Poland Coalition) : Issue not mentioned in election programme  Konfederation:  Opposes marriage equality and adoption of children by same sex couples image copyright Getty Images image caption Equality marchers faced taunts from nationalist protesters in Nowy Sacz in southern Poland on Sunday The couple who came back to fight for change In the beautiful, medieval city of Torun, birthplace of the astronomer Copernicus, chef Mariusz Godlejewski rejected the notion that he was a threat. During more than a decade living in Ireland, Mariusz married his long-term partner Bartosz before the couple returned to their homeland last year.  ""My husband and I have been together for 14 years. Who are we, two strangers living together? We are family as well,"" he said. ""Coming back here I knew what I was getting in to. I knew that I will lose all the rights with my husband we gained in Ireland but we wanted to come and help our friends to make the change.""     BBC We can make our nation better by having new ideas, embracing them and adding to our culture Mariusz Godlejewski  Chef Mariusz believes it is only a matter of time before things do change but finds the tone of political debate depressing. Last month, a professor from Torun's Copernicus University, Aleksander Nalaskowski, was suspended after he likened homosexuality to ""the plague"" and complained that gay men and women were demanding not only tolerance, but acceptance.  LGBT Virgin Mary triggers activist's detention Poland court bans 'LGBT-free zone' sticker The gay mayor shaking up politics in Catholic Poland Government-supporting circles argued his suspension was an abuse of free speech and he was subsequently reinstated.  media caption Police fired tear gas and clashed with anti-LGBT protesters in Bialystok in July 2019 Spread of equality marches in Poland Mariusz was organising the third equality march in Torun, in which more than a thousand people walked through the city guarded on both sides by helmeted riot police carrying shields.  A police water cannon I saw parked in the road was not required but violence has broken out during equality marches in the cities of Bialystok, where gangs of angry young men attacked parade participants, and in Lublin, where counter demonstrators clashed with police and two protesters were arrested after they reportedly brought homemade explosive devices. Poland remains more socially conservative than many countries in Western Europe but attitudes to LGBT+ issues are changing.      Reuters Poles and same-sex couples Opinion poll based on sample of 1,000 people 57% Support same-sex civil partnerships 55% Against gay marriage 80% Oppose adoption of children by same-sex couples Source: Kantar/Gazeta Wyborcza There are more and more equality marches, 32 this year compared to 13 last year. Most, like the one in Torun, are joyful, peaceful events.  'They have to be aware they are sinners' Underneath a statue of Copernicus in the city centre, a small counter demonstration gathered before the equality march. There were several members of the far-right National Radical Camp, holding their green and white flags emblazoned with a falanga sword, which is associated with fascism.  There were also banners warning about how the ""LGBT lobby"" wants to teach pre-schoolers how to masturbate, above the slogan ""Stop paedophilia"".   image caption A small counter march in Torun assembled beneath a statue of Copernicus There was also a photo of an equality parade showing two male marchers holding a rainbow flag from behind, their bare buttocks pixellated. Some people held crosses and handed out white, plastic rosary beads before prayers were said for the souls of the equality march participants. ""Everyone has the same rights. For example, they have the same right to marry. I can marry my girlfriend, they can also marry their girlfriends, but they want to marry the same sex,"" organiser and teacher Radoslaw Duch said. ""We don't want to arrest them, we don't want to get rid of them. They have to be aware they are sinners. Me as a Catholic person, I want to show them a better path of their life,"" he added. If opinion polls are correct, PiS should win the October 13 election comfortably.  Attitudes in Poland may be changing, but if Mr Kaczynski's party does win a second term, there seems little chance that homosexual couples will enjoy the same rights as their heterosexual neighbours any time soon.

They were arrested in September 2019  as part of the largest operation of its type ever carried out by North Wales Police.   A judge at Mold Crown Court described it as a ""sophisticated operation"", involving encrypted mobile phones, lie detectors and even a plot to attack a former gang member who had fallen out of favour.  Police seized drugs with a street value of Â£2.1m. '100 county lines drug networks in Wales' Call to review 'criminal abuse' of mobile phones County lines threat prompts university to act The reach of the gang, based in Liverpool, stretched to Aberdeen and Cornwall. It was an operation described as a classic example of a ""county lines"" conspiracy.   The group behind the supply, led by Colin Jones, were violent and were specifically targeted by police due to the threat posed to public safety.  image copyright North Wales Police image caption Colin Jones and Richard Anderson met to exchange a white Mercedes car for cocaine in October 2018 Officers had spent nearly three years investigating the gang, right to the very top.   Colin Jones, based in Walton in Liverpool, was described as a drugs wholesaler who rarely got his hands dirty. When he was arrested, police found he had nine phones, and two encrypted devices. He hired lie detector specialists to check out his colleagues. As well as selling drugs, he swapped them for sports cars.   image copyright North Wales Police image caption Anthony Stagg and Tony Stagg in Towyn to meet Colin Jones in August 2018 Colin Jones had a team of call handlers who answered what the gang called ""the Echo Line"".   In a three-month period in 2018, the hotline took over 100,000 calls. Police estimated it was selling several thousand pounds of drugs a day. Drugs were also sent up and down the UK, sometimes in packages sent from local post offices in Liverpool.  media caption What is ""county lines""? At one point the violence was turned on one of their former conspirators. Colin Jones and David Rawling were secretly recorded talking to an unknown hit man arranging an attack on Lee Murray.   Officers stepped in and stopped the attack, but believed a gun would have been involved. 'Significant victory' Judge Niclas Parry spent three days sentencing the gang. He said they had controlled a significant portion of the drugs trade in Deeside, casting a blight on the community. Colin Jones was sentenced to 21 years  in total with the other gang members given sentences from four to 15 and a half years. Police say it is a significant victory against the supply of drugs from big cities into north Wales - but it remains a fight that will continue in the months to come.

Dozens of schools, shopping centres, railway stations and public buildings have been evacuated. Tens of thousands of people have been affected. So far, all of the alerts have proved to be hoaxes and the public has been urged to remain calm. The source of the threats is unclear but one official suggested they had originated outside Russia. ""There's reason to assume this was all organised abroad,"" the official in Chelyabinsk told Interfax news agency. On Wednesday, the bomb scares spread to Moscow, prompting the evacuation of the luxury GUM shopping centre near the Kremlin. In the capital alone, more than 50,000 people were caught up in the alerts, reports said. image caption Muscovites milled around outside the GUM centre after it was evacuated Pro-Kremlin newspapers have pointed to a ""major hacking attack"", possibly from Ukraine. State TV said 205 companies and organisations had been targeted nationally. Massive cyber-attack hits 99 countries Where has ransomware hit hardest? Russian hackers 'target' Macron campaign Other reports suggested the threats were made via scrambled internet connections and were difficult to source. One official was quoted as saying the evacuations were part of an anti-terrorist drill but that has not been confirmed. Four days of threats The hoax calls began on Sunday but the extent of the alerts only became clear by Tuesday: In Chelyabinsk, in the southern Ural mountains, more than 11,000 people were cleared from 10 buildings on Tuesday In Perm to the north-west, 5,700 people had to leave schools and public buildings In the southern city of Stavropol alone, 1,500 phone hoaxes had been received, state TV reported Other cities affected ranged from Krasnoyarsk, Novosibirsk and Omsk in Siberia to the enclave of Kaliningrad in the far west image copyright AFP image caption Police searches continued in cities across Russia (file pic) They continued to spread on Wednesday, with airports also targeted: In Moscow, bomb alerts were reported in Red Square, at railway stations, universities and shopping centres The River Volga cities of Samara and Saratov were hit, with seven shopping centres targeted in Saratov alone Several more Siberian cities were affected: in Ulan-Ude there were alerts at six shopping centres, four schools and bus and railway stations Irkutsk and Yakutsk were hit, and in Tomsk more than 10 schools were evacuated, along with local courts, shopping centres and a bus station Who is behind it? No-one is certain but the alerts appear to have come in the form of a pre-recorded voice message via internet telephony. One message received in the city of Ufa was broadcast on national TV. ""An explosive device has been placed in the building. Evacuate the people, call the bomb squads. This is not a drill. Do you understand me?""  A security source told pro-Kremlin tabloid Komsomolskaya Pravda that the hoaxes were the result of a cyber attack organised from Ukraine, although no evidence was given. An IT security specialist quoted elsewhere spoke only of a foreign hacking attack. The governor of Stavropol called it a ""phone attack"" that had come from abroad and one phone company spoke of an ""international virtual operator"". Russian military exercise raises tension There was some suggestion, too, that the source of the disruption may have been closer to home. An aide to the Russian defence ministry's inspector general was quoted as saying it was part of an anti-terror exercise. ""For the first time since Soviet times, large-scale anti-terrorism exercises are being carried out in Russia, involving all government agencies responsible for state security,"" Oleg Ostrovsky told newspaper Argumenty i Fakty Prikamye. The report was later deleted, according to BBC Monitoring. Russia has been hit by jihadist attacks, including a bombing on the St Petersburg metro in April in which 16 people died. However, a former opposition MP, Gennady Gudkov, warned that if the current alerts really were the work of federal security officers, then ""that is completely crap"".

It also said questions raised should be disclosed to campaigners, who have been asking for greater legal clarity over what the intelligence agencies can do.   It comes a day after the intelligence services watchdog raised its own questions about some MI6 activities.   Since 1994, MI6 - the UK's foreign intelligence service - has been able to authorise people that it recruits to help the UK overseas to commit crimes as part of its targeting of threats to the UK.  That power has long-been dubbed the "" James Bond clause "" - but it does not explicitly permit criminal operations in the UK.   Unprecedented legislation that clarifies how agencies recruiting undercover informants can authorise them to commit crimes is reaching its final stages in Parliament. The disclosure of crimes potentially committed by people supplying MI6 with intelligence has come amid a long-running court battle over whether such secret undercover activity can ever be legal. New rules for MI5 and police to authorise crimes Power for MI5 informants to commit crimes 'lawful' While the legal battle has revealed details of how MI5, the domestic security service, authorises crimes by its informants, Wednesday's disclosure by the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) is the first indication that MI6 may be doing the same.  In the ruling, the IPT rejected secret submissions from the government to keep the entire matter behind closed doors.  The disclosure came the day after the annual report of the Investigatory Powers Commissioner, the watchdog that oversees the secret agencies, revealed that one of MI6's agents overseas may have gone rogue and committed serious crimes. The report says  that in 2019 the secret agency had recruited a potential agent overseas and had sought a standard authorisation from the foreign secretary for the individual to potentially commit crimes as part of their work for the UK.  The report does not state which foreign secretary it was. ""The Secret Intelligence Service [MI6] identified a risk that the agent may be involved in serious criminality overseas,"" said the report. ""SIS did not encourage, condone or approve any such criminality on the part of their agent.  ""In their submission, SIS set out that they had secured the agent's cooperation on terms of full transparency about the activities in which the agent was involved.  ""It included some clear 'red lines', setting out conduct that was not authorised and would result in the termination of SIS's relationship with the agent."" Six months later, when the authorisation had to be reviewed, it appeared that MI6 had concluded the asset had probably crossed those red lines - but they did not tell the foreign secretary, who had to sign off the continuing operation.  ""We concluded that the renewal did not provide a comprehensive overview of available information which we believe would have provided the Secretary of State with a fuller and more balanced picture,"" said the watchdog. ""SIS immediately responded to these concerns by updating the FCO."" Campaigners behind the legal action say both revelations prove the public are being kept in the dark. But ministers say  legislation going through Parliament  will provide clear safeguards for agents to commit crimes while undercover.

President Emmanuel Macron said the EU's Schengen area, which allows people to cross borders freely, may need reform. A knife attack in Nice last week, which killed three people, was blamed on a Tunisian migrant who crossed into France from Italy in October. It was the second alleged jihadist attack in France in just over a month. France's security alert is at its highest level, with thousands of soldiers deployed to protect places of worship and schools, since teacher Samuel Paty was beheaded for showing cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad to his students. media caption Police gunshots heard as three killed in Nice 'Islamist terrorist' stabbings President Macron has since sparked anger and protests in some Muslim-majority countries with his robust defence of France's values and freedoms that permitted the publication of cartoons.  But he has rejected right-wing calls for greater safeguards to protect the country's principle of secularism, saying: ""The situation does not warrant changing the constitution."" And, in a  letter to the Financial Times , he made clear France was fighting ""Islamist separatism, never Islam"". He accused the British newspaper of misquoting him in an article - which has since been removed from its website - suggesting he was ""stigmatising French Muslims for electoral purposes"".  ""I will not allow anybody to claim that France, or its government, is fostering racism against Muslims,"" he said in the letter to the editor. What did Macron say about border security? Speaking during a visit to the French-Spanish border, Mr Macron said he would be doubling police border patrol numbers from 2,400 to 4,800 ""because of the worsening of the threat"" of terrorism. He also said he would be unveiling proposals for strengthening border security within the EU at the next EU summit in December, which would include ""intensifying our common border protection with a real security force at the external borders"".  Under the Schengen agreement, people within the EU are able to pass freely across borders without showing their passport. However, border checks have made a return in recent months because of the coronavirus pandemic. What do we know of the recent attacks? An elderly woman was beheaded and two other people were killed in a church in Nice on 29 October. Witnesses said they heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is Greatest). The suspect, who was shot and detained by police, was identified as Brahim Aioussaoi - a 21-year-old Tunisian man who had travelled to the Italian island of Lampedusa in September and crossed into France a few days before the attack. In pictures: Scene of knife attack in Nice What we know about fatal knife attack in Nice Earlier in October, Samuel Paty, a teacher in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine, north-west of Paris, was attacked and beheaded in the street by an 18-year-old Chechen Muslim. He had been the target of threats for days after showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to pupils as part of a civics lesson.  Seven charged over French teacher's beheading Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Depictions of the Prophet Muhammad are widely regarded as taboo in Islam , and are offensive to Muslims. The issue is particularly sensitive in France because of the decision by satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo to publish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad.  A trial is currently under way over the killing of 12 people by Islamist extremists at the magazine's offices in 2015 following their publication. France's Muslim community, which is Europe's largest, comprises about 10% of the population. Some French Muslims say they are frequent targets of racism and discrimination because of their faith - an issue that has long caused tension in the country.

The recession has seen a massive reduction in public and private funding for house building, Audit Scotland said. Supply of new properties is failing to keep up with demand.  And it could be 20 years before enough new homes are being built to meet the projected increase in households. The spending watchdog said that, as the population continued to grow, the 2020 vision was ""ambitious"" and the government needed to clarify how it would work with councils and other partners in the sector to meet its targets. Budgets tightening The Housing in Scotland report was produced for the Auditor General and the Accounts Commission. Caroline Gardner, Auditor General for Scotland, said: ""Housing is a significant national asset and the sector in Scotland is under increasing pressure. Budgets are tightening, while demand is increasing and fewer houses are being built."" The report revealed that private sector house building has more than halved in recent years.  And since 2005 local authorities and Registered Social Landlords (RSL), who are key to providing low rent homes, have built 14,000 fewer homes than research suggested were needed. Changes to the benefit system, an ageing population and the increasing number of single person households were creating further pressures on the sector. The report notes Scottish government funding for housing fell by around a quarter between 2008-09 and 2011-12 with further reductions to come. John Baillie, chair of the Accounts Commission, said: ""Good housing is important for individuals and families but also for wider society.  It can support economic growth, promote strong, resilient communities and improve health.  ""Links between housing and other policy areas at both national and local level should be stronger, to help improve the impact that good housing can make to our communities."" Responding to the report, a Scottish government spokesman said it had taken ""decisive action"" to improve housing in Scotland.  'Collapse in availability' He added: ""We are investing nearly Â£900m over three years as part of our target of building 30,000 new, affordable homes over the lifetime of this parliament. ""As this report recognises, we are having to deal with Westminster's cuts to our capital budgets, a difficult lending environment, and the UK government's welfare reform agenda - all of which add to the pressures that we face in delivering new affordable homes. The Scottish Federation of Housing Associations welcomed the emphasis placed by Audit Scotland on the provision of affordable public sector housing. Policy manager Susan Torrance said: ""We are particularly pleased to see encouragement to improve transparency in the reporting of budgets and supply targets.  ""The challenges made by Audit Scotland to strengthen national and local housing strategies to improve supply and construction of homes to meet housing need are important."" Gordon MacRae, head of policy at housing charity Shelter Scotland, said: ""The report clearly shows that action is required now to meet the challenge of a collapse in availability of new homes and the spiralling demands of Scotland's ageing and increasingly single households. ""To end Scotland's housing crisis for good, Scotland needs a clear housing strategy aimed at creating good quality homes for the country's 157,000 households stuck on council waiting lists.""

The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign orchestrated against Mr Paty. The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher.

The PM hailed the vaccine rollout, but warned that now was not the time to ""relax"". He said there were still more people in hospital than at the peak of the first wave, and steps taken to ease lockdown should be ""cautious but irreversible"". He is to set out a roadmap next week for lifting England's restrictions. The government said on Sunday  that it had met its pledge to offer at least one Covid vaccine dose to everyone in the top four priority groups in the UK. More than 15 million people have received a first dose,  according to the latest government figures. Speaking at Monday's Downing Street briefing, Mr Johnson hailed the ""unprecedented national achievement"" of hitting the target, but warned the threat from the virus remained ""very real"".  The prime minister warned that the government did not have all the ""hard facts"" about how the vaccine impacted infections and that there were still more people in hospital with Covid-19 than in April - with admissions running at 1,600 a day across the UK. ""We have to keep our foot to the floor,"" he said. 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid  Third of social care staff 'still not vaccinated' First travellers arrive for hotel quarantine stay Plan to end lockdown 'cautious but irreversible' Mr Johnson said no decisions were being taken before he unveiled his roadmap for ending England's restrictions, but that the government wanted this lockdown ""to be the last"", with ""cautious but irreversible"" progress. He added his plan next week would set out ""as much as we possibly can about the route to normality, even though some things are very uncertain"". Although he said he was ""increasingly optimistic"" he admitted he could not give ""an absolute cast-iron guarantee that we won't face further difficulties"". ""I don't want people to think I'm not optimistic. There's been a big change - science is now in the ascendency over the disease,"" he added. Mr Johnson also said the government was looking at introducing rapid lateral flow testing for venues such as nightclubs and some theatres that were unable to open last year. ""I think that, in combination with vaccination, will probably be the route forward,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association, said the ""acknowledgement"" would give late night businesses ""the opportunity to deliver pilot schemes which will substantiate the ability for this sector to open safely at the appropriate time"". ""But more importantly we will be able to plan and prepare for that opportunity,"" he added. Could this be the last lockdown? That is, of course, a huge shared hope and the government's stated aim. It will soon be exactly a year since the first lockdown was brought in.  Who knew then that we'd be in a third period of national restrictions 12 months later? Boris Johnson has been accused, at times, of over-promising and under-delivering during this crisis. Today, again, he's urging caution - even as case rates fall and the vaccine rollout goes well. That's because ministers really don't want to lift restrictions only to reimpose them again on a weary nation. It comes after  more than 60 Conservative MPs wrote to Mr Johnson over the weekend , calling for a commitment to a ""free life"" and the ending of lockdown measures before May. Steve Baker, the deputy chair of the lockdown-sceptic Covid Research Group (CRG) of Tory MPs leading the call, said schools should return on 8 March, hospitality should reopen by Easter and all other elements should be back to normal by 1 May - when all people in the top nine priority groups have been offered a vaccine. media caption Johnson: 'We want progress to be cautious but also irreversible' Earlier, No 10 said the intention was to ""start getting"" pupils back into school on 8 March, but was not ruling out the possibility that they could be sent back in stages. The PM's official spokesman said it was ""important"" the planned review of restrictions was carried out this week, with details to be set out in Mr Johnson's road map on Monday. The spokesman said he would not ""pre-empt"" what the road map might contain, but added: ""It remains our priority to get kids back to school and we always said we want that to start from 8 March, if the science and evidence allows."" LOCKDOWN RULES:  What are they and when will they end? SCHOOLS:  When will they reopen? VACCINE:  When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:  How worried should we be? The government is hoping to offer a jab to everyone in the first nine priority groups - including everyone over the age of 50 - by the end of April, Mr Johnson said. This would run alongside giving second doses within the 12-week window to those in the top four priority groups, who have already had a first dose. All those aged between 16 and 64 with underlying health conditions, as well as adult carers, are being contacted with the offer of a vaccination.  With every day that passes, it becomes clearer and clearer that the UK is winning its fight against Covid. Science, as Boris Johnson said, is in the ascendancy. It is easy to forget this virus only emerged just over a year ago. But now the UK has approved three vaccines for use - two of which have already started to be rolled out at speed. Another two are being assessed by the regulator after promising trial results. There is confidence the mutations, while presenting a challenge, can be overcome. Plans are already being made to update the vaccines if needed to work better against new variants. No vaccine is 100% effective and some people may choose not to take it. That's why advances in treatment are vital, too. A cheap steroid, dexamethasone, is being widely used to improve the survival rates of the sickest patients. And last week it emerged an arthritis drug, tocilizumab, could also further improve survival chances. There is still a long way to go, but there is a cautious belief in both Westminster and among scientists that each step made from now on should be forward not back. Speaking at the same Downing Street briefing, NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens described the vaccine rollout as ""two sprints and a marathon"". He said the UK had passed the ""finishing line of the first sprint"" and now had a ""second sprint between now and 30 April"" to extend the vaccine rollout to higher risk groups. The ""marathon"" will involve vaccinating everybody in the country who is eligible, alongside the winter flu campaign and further booster shots if needed, Sir Simon added. Meanwhile, on Monday, the UK recorded another 9,765 new coronavirus infections, according to the latest government figures. It is the first time the daily cases figure has been under 10,000 since 2 October. A further 230 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Fewer deaths tend to be reported on Mondays due to a reporting lag over the weekend.

The Daily Telegraph leads with Theresa May's admission that the government had been  ""blown off course""  in its attempts to curb immigration to the UK, and was ""unlikely"" to reduce net migration figures to the under-100,000-a-year target it had set itself. The home secretary gave an interview to the paper confirming that the coalition was shelving its pledge to achieve the reduction by 2015. It was a pledge David Cameron had said was a ""no ifs, no buts"" promise, the Telegraph notes. Mrs May's assertion that the rising migration figures were partly as a result of the British economy's strength compared to EU rivals cuts no ice with her Labour counterpart, the paper adds. ""Continually making and breaking grand promises on immigration is only undermining confidence in the entire system,"" Labour's Yvette Cooper says. The Daily Mail says the abandoning of the pledge has triggered a  ""furious political row"" . It says recent figures show net migration is currently running at 240,000 a year. The Daily Express highlights former Conservative minister  Peter Lilley's comments  that: ""Most people believe Britain is full - and they are right. We are already a nation of more than 60 million. We cannot take any more and have to shut the door."" The Daily Mirror focuses on Ed Miliband's vow to  ""shut rogue job agencies that undercut wages and exploit workers."" ""He will stop big firms using rogue agencies to hire staff on the cheap,"" the paper says, ""and ban job Â­agencies recruiting only from abroad."" It's a theme taken up by the Guardian's editorial which says agency working and zero-hours contracts have driven down pay levels to a level that encourages migration from low-wage economies. ""Tackling Britain's  hyper-flexible under-regulated labour market should be a priority, "" it adds. image copyright Getty Images The Daily Telegraph has a feature by Mats Persson of the think tank Open Europe. Mr Persson, whose ideas the prime minister is said to be considering, argues that in-work benefits - such as tax credits, social housing and access to the NHS - should not be ""immediately available"" to new arrivals from other EU countries. These benefits are a ""taxpayer-backed-subsidy"" enabling migrants from low cost countries to work at jobs most British workers would say they couldn't afford to take. Mr Persson illustrates his point by arguing that a typical Polish migrant can up his or her take-home pay by 95% by coming to Britain and claiming working benefits, but if those benefits were withdrawn, the same Pole would be earning 27% less than if he or she had stayed in his or her native country. The Express notes that former chancellor Kenneth Clarke has called the idea ""discriminatory"". 'Disquieting backdrop' Mrs May's pronouncements were not just on migration, but addressed the threat the UK faced from potential terrorism by jihadists. image copyright PA image caption The Provisional IRA's campaign in mainland Britain left at least 115 people dead The Daily Mail puts a comment from a Whitehall official that an attack is  ""almost inevitable"" , on its front page. Mrs May is to outline new anti-terror powers, the paper adds, including forcibly relocating terror suspects and barring Britons returning from Syria from entering the UK for two years. In her interview in the Daily Telegraph, the home secretary says, ""Britain is facing the greatest terror threat of its history."" The idea that Britain faces a worse threat than during the IRA's bombing campaign is a  ""disquieting backdrop "", the paper's leader column says. The Guardian focuses on another announcement Mrs May is expected to make: that insurance companies will be banned from reimbursing ransom payments. The measure is designed to  ""cut funding to barbaric terror groups"" , the paper explains. In another story, the Guardian casts doubt on whether the US airstrikes in Syria are undermining support for Islamic State (IS) jihadists. The paper carries a series of interviews with Syrian opposition fighters who say support for IS is growing because of the bombing, both from civilians and armed insurgents. ""All the locals here wonder why the US coalition never came to rescue them from Assad's machine guns, but run to fight Isis when it took a few pieces of land,"" says one Free Syrian Army commander. The Daily Star says that SAS ""hit squads"" are killing hundreds of IS jihadists in  ""a series of daring raids"" . image copyright AFP image caption Kurdish fighters have enjoyed some success against IS militants in recent weeks The elite soldiers are using quad bikes to cross desert terrain and then attack the militants with sniper fire and heavy machine guns, it says. ""Our tactics are putting the fear of God into IS as they don't know where we're going to strike next and there's frankly nothing they can do to stop us,"" the paper's ""SAS source"" tells it. The Times is one of many papers to features two former British soldiers who have joined Syrian Kurds to fight IS. The pair deny being mercenaries, but say they were motivated to stop the slaughter of civilians in a war of  ""good versus evil"" . The paper notes British police are investigating reports that a 17-year-old girl from London may also be trying to join Kurdish forces. 'A lifetime of insecurity' ""The young are the new poor"" reads the Independent's stark headline. It refers to a report from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation which says that ""the rise of part-time work and low-paid self-employment has been accompanied by a sharp increase in the number of under-25s living below the breadline"". The Foundation says as many working families as unemployed ones now live in its definition of poverty, and young people are  more likely to be poor than pensioners are . image copyright Thinkstock ""Pensioners have benefited from targeted policies, seeing a sharp fall in poverty to a record low level: from once being the most likely to be poor, the over-65s now have the lowest poverty rate of any age group,"" the paper says. The paper continues that the study suggests: ""That while employment was close to a historic high, millions of Britons were struggling to cope with a reality of insecure work and incomes which have fallen on average by 9% in the five years to 2013."" It carries a case study of a 22-year-old from Sheffield who has a masters degree in clinical neurology, but was unable to find work in the field despite 174 interviews and now works as a cleaner. Rebecca Field tells the Independent that she still relies on her parents to top up her earnings, and may be forced to move back in with them. ""There is a real lack of jobs. It's not just the graduates from this year competing for jobs, it's the graduates from last year,"" she tells the paper. In its editorial, the paper says that the problem is not ""selfish oldies"" but poorly paid and insecure work, coupled with a lack of affordable accommodation. ""One alarming fact in the report is that most self-employed people earn markedly less now than they did five years ago.  ""This should disturb everyone, because the rapid rise in self-employment is constantly extolled as a good thing - the welcome liberation of the workforce from the old tyranny of office and factory life.  ""Now we can see that this new freedom is often a ticket to a lifetime of insecurity,"" the editorial says. Molten One man's image dominates Monday's front pages. With his diamond earrings, glamorous pop star girlfriend and, now, second Formula One world championship, it's unsurprising that Lewis Hamilton sports the widest grin humanly possible. ""I Ham the Greatest"", is the Daily Star's  slightly tortuous headline , the paper noting that the ""normally ice cool racing driver wept inside his visor"" as he embraced his girlfriend Nicole Scherzinger. The Daily Mail has a quote box featuring Prince Harry's words to the  British champion after the race . image copyright Getty Images ""Lewis, thank you very, very much for not making the British public sweat. You are an absolute legend. well done, mate,"" the Prince said. A rather overwhelmed Hamilton replied: ""Woohooo! World Champion. Oh my God. I can't believe it. Thank you so much guys."" The Sun notes his win puts Hamilton in the  Â£100m earning bracket. ""The F1 ace and his girlfriend... are primed to be the next celebrity super-couple,"" it adds. The Daily Mirror, with the editorial, ""Lew beauty"", makes a plea for the ""speedster"" to return to the UK from Monaco to  ""make a greater contribution to British society"" . Sports writer Kevin Garside in a comment piece in the Independent waxes lyrical on the way Hamilton bested his only realistic rival for the crown this year, his team-mate Nico Rosberg. "" If you are going to make a statement, make it a big one .  ""Hamilton rammed syllable by syllable the speculative pre-race pap about the pressure getting to him down the exhaust pipes of Rosberg. Pressure would play a part, Rosberg was right about that. He simply identified the wrong victim. ""Hamilton handed down a textbook lesson in how to cope when the heat turns molten, delivering what he described as the best start of his career precisely at the point he needed it most, blazing off the grid 'like a rocket' to beat Rosberg into the first corner.""

New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio has pledged to raise the minimum wage and issue ID papers to undocumented immigrants. Setting out the policies of his new administration in a State of the City address, Mr de Blasio took aim at the city's yawning inequality gap. The 52-year-old also wants to raise taxes on the wealthy to fund universal pre-kindergarten programmes. Elected in November, he is New York's first Democratic mayor in two decades. 'More success stories' In Monday's speech, Mr de Blasio said: ""We understand that allowing the income gap to stretch further isn't simply a threat to those at the bottom but to every New Yorker."" The married father of two chose a Queens community college to make one of the most important speeches of his young administration. It was a relatively low-key venue compared with the stylish new Brooklyn Nets arena where his three-term predecessor, Michael Bloomberg, gave his last State of the City address. ""We want to ensure that New Yorkers aren't relegated to the ranks of the poor when putting in a full week's work,"" Mr de Blasio said of raising the minimum wage. ""We will send a powerful signal to the people of New York, that we honour work... and that we are committed to making work pay."" He also said his administration would help an estimated half a million undocumented New Yorkers out of a city of eight million residents. ""To all of my fellow New Yorkers who are undocumented, I say New York City is your home too,"" he said, ""and we will not force any of our residents to live their lives in the shadows."" Of his plans to follow through on a central campaign pledge by delivering universal pre-kindergarten, Mr de Blasio said it would tax the wealthy not to ""punish success"" but to ""create more success stories"". Although the city council is controlled by Mr de Blasio's Democratic allies, the minimum-wage plan needs support from the New York state governor, Andrew Cuomo, to become law.  media caption The BBC spoke to New Yorkers in the Bronx to find out how they think a shift in policing will impact their lives Mr Cuomo is also a Democrat, but he is facing an election in November and has refused to raise taxes, instead proposing to fund universal pre-kindergarten out of the state budget. Later this week, Mr de Blasio will deliver another important speech, outlining his plans for the city's $70bn (Â£42bn) budget. The New York mayor has cheered liberal supporters with some of his stances early in his administration. Last week, he said he would not attend next month's St Patrick's Day Parade because of its ban on marchers who carry gay-pride signs.  He would be the first New York City mayor in two decades to boycott the event. Mr de Blasio has also signalled a possible ban on horse carriages that carry tourists around New York City's Central Park, saying it is inhumane to the animals.

Samuel Paty, 47, was targeted for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his students. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after last Friday's attack. But seven people, including two students and a parent of one of Mr Paty's pupils, were detained in the days following the killing. On Wednesday, prosecutors said six of the suspects had been charged with complicity in a terrorist murder and placed under judicial investigation. One man is accused of having close contact with the killer and faces the lesser charge of associating with a terrorist. Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam All of the suspects, other than the two students who are minors at just 14 and 15, are in custody. Mr Paty's killing stunned France and led to an outpouring of support at memorial ceremonies and marches around the country.  On Wednesday evening, President Emmanuel Macron hailed Mr Paty as ""a quiet hero"" and ""the face of the Republic"" at an event in Paris. He then presented the teacher's family with the nation's highest honour, the LÃ©gion d'honneur. Who has been charged? France's chief anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard announced the charges on Wednesday, and gave fuller details of the police investigation at a press conference. Two teenage students , who cannot be named for legal reasons, were allegedly paid around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) by the killer to identify Mr Paty outside the school. The killer told the students he wanted to ""hit"" and ""humiliate"" Mr Paty and ""make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", Mr Ricard said.  The teenagers are alleged to have described the teacher to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours until Mr Paty appeared.  A man named only as  Brahim C , a parent of one of Mr Paty's pupils, is also under investigation. The 48-year-old is accused of orchestrating a hate campaign against Mr Paty and exchanging text messages with the killer before the attack. On Wednesday, Mr Ricard said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the online campaign and Mr Paty's death. media caption Rallies in Paris, Toulouse, Lyon and other French cities in support of Samuel Paty Also in custody is  Abdelhakim Sefrioui , a preacher and activist who was reportedly known to the French intelligence services for years. Both he and Brahim C made videos in which they reportedly insulted Mr Paty and demanded his suspension.  Earlier, Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin told Europe 1 radio that the pair had ""apparently launched a fatwa against the teacher"". Three friends of Anzorov  are also facing prosecution. One of them allegedly drove him to the school, while another is accused of helping him purchase a weapon. Both men have been charged with complicity in a terrorist murder while the third was charged with the lesser offence of terrorist association. Meanwhile, on Thursday, it emerged that Anzorov had been in contact with a Russian-speaking jihadist in Syria before he carried out the attack. Anzorov was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008. Why was Samuel Paty targeted? The teacher had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October.

Night-time patrols have been stepped up by the Aspinall Foundation, which runs Port Lympne and Howletts wildlife parks near Canterbury. Police said they had an anonymous tip-off the foundation's black rhinos could be targeted by poachers, who sell the horns for traditional medicine.  The foundation currently has 20 black rhinos at the two parks. The animals are locked up at night, but the parks are asking local people to help increase the patrols. Bob O'Connor, the managing director of the two parks, said: ""We had a call from Kent Police saying they had been informed through Crimestoppers that someone intended to harm our rhino. ""Over the last few years there has been a trend for breaking into museums and stealing stuffed rhino heads for their horns, including one recently in Kent."" He said keepers live on-site at the parks and carry out patrols overnight.  ""With this level of threat, and it's impossible to judge what the threat is, we have now stepped up those night-time patrols and we are asking local people to work with our staff to increase the number of patrols."" He said a rhino horn could sell for up to Â£200,000.  Michael Laidlow, the wildlife and rural environmental crime co-ordinator for Kent Police said the force had received anonymous information that the parks may be attacked.  ""We've taken steps to deal with it by informing the park and making officers aware of what the threat is. ""We take every threat seriously, especially when it deals with the rhinos,"" he said. 'Vile activities' Over the last seven years 33 black rhinos have been born in the foundation's parks and members of the critically endangered species have been returned to the wild. Last year three animals from Port Lympne were released in Tanzania. Poachers target animals living in the wild in Africa. The horns are used in traditional medicine in countries such as China and Vietnam.  Damian Aspinall said: ""It is tragic and beyond belief that, as we do everything possible to restore these magnificent animals safely to the wild, the human traders who seek to profit from their slaughter should bring their vile activities to the UK."" In June the Duke of Cambridge  spoke out  against the illegal trade in rhino horn, calling those who take part in it ""ignorant, selfish and utterly wrong"".

Samuel Paty was targeted close to his school near Paris for showing cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad in class. His killer, 18-year-old Abdullakh Anzorov, was shot dead by police shortly after the attack. On Wednesday, prosecutors said Anzorov had paid two teenage students around â¬300 (Â£270; $355) to identify Mr Paty. The killer told the students he wanted to ""film the teacher [and] make him apologise for the cartoon of the Prophet [Muhammad]"", anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said at a press conference. He said Anzorov had told them he wanted ""to humiliate him, to hit him"". Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam The students, aged 14 and 15, are alleged to have described Mr Paty, 47, to Anzorov and stayed with him for more than two hours outside the school until the teacher appeared, Mr Ricard said. The pair, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are two of seven people the French authorities are seeking to prosecute over the brutal attack. Online hate campaign The prosecutor also said there was a ""direct causal link"" between the killing and an online hate campaign that was orchestrated against Mr Paty. The campaign was allegedly launched by the father of one of his pupils. The man, 48, who has been named in French media only as Brahim C, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. On Wednesday, Mr Ricard confirmed reports that Brahim C, who is also facing prosecution, had exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack. image copyright AFP image caption Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had faced threats for showing the cartoons He also posted videos denouncing Mr Paty after he showed the cartoons in two lessons about free speech earlier this month But Mr Ricard said the father's anger and statements in the videos were based on ""inaccurate facts"" because his daughter had not been in the relevant lessons. Macron to attend national memorial The prosecutor's revelations come ahead of a national memorial service in Paris for Mr Paty.  President Emmanuel Macron will attend the event at the Sorbonne University on Wednesday evening, along with the teacher's family and some 400 guests.  He is expected to posthumously give Mr Paty France's highest award, the Legion d'Honneur, Earlier, the president held a call with Russian President Vladimir Putin and urged co-operation in fighting terrorism. Mr Putin described the attack as a ""barbarous murder"". Mr Paty's killer, Anzorov, was born in Moscow and his family is from Russia's Muslim-majority Chechnya region in the North Caucasus. He had lived in France since 2008. Mr Macron said he wanted to see a ""strengthening of Franco-Russian co-operation in the fight against terrorism and illegal immigration"", the French presidency said. Russia has played down any association with the attacker. ""This person had lived in France for the past 12 years,"" a spokesman for the Russian embassy in Paris told the Tass news agency on Saturday. Mosque closed amid mass raids Police have raided some 40 homes following the attack, and the government also ordered a mosque to close for six months. The Pantin mosque, just north of Paris, was closed after it emerged it had shared videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty.  In one clip, posted just days before the attack, it also shared his school's address.  media caption French minister: Lessons on freedom of expression will continue The mosque later expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing. Meanwhile, mosques in the south-western cities of Bordeaux and Beziers were put under police protection after they reported threats. ""Such actions are unacceptable on the soil of the Republic,"" Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said in a tweet on Wednesday. On Tuesday, President Macron said the Sheikh Yassin Collective - an Islamist group named after the founder of the Palestinian militant group Hamas - would be outlawed for being ""directly involved"" in the killing. He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community from the influence of radicalism. Why was Samuel Paty targeted? Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class on 6 October.

Mr Paty, who was killed on Friday, had earlier shown controversial cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad to his pupils. The 48-year-old father, who has not been officially named, is accused of issuing a ""fatwa"" against the teacher. The brutal murder of Mr Paty, 47, has shocked France.  Tens of thousands of people took part in rallies across France at the weekend to honour him and defend freedom of speech.

Beheading of teacher deepens divisions in France The father of the pupil is reported to have exchanged a number of text messages with Mr Paty's killer prior to the attack close to the teacher's school in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine. He is accused, along with a preacher described by French media as a radical Islamist, of calling for Mr Paty to be punished by issuing a so-called ""fatwa"" (considered a legal ruling by Islamic scholars). Interior Minister GÃ©rald Darmanin said the two men had been arrested and were being investigated for an ""assassination in connection with a terrorist enterprise"". media caption French minister: Lessons on freedom of expression will continue Police launched a series of raids targeting Islamist networks on Monday, and some 40 homes were targeted.

He said the ban was a way of helping France's Muslim community, Europe's largest, from the influence of radicalism. The group's leader is among 16 people who were taken into custody in the aftermath of the murder. Six have now been released after questioning including the killer's grandfather, parents and 17-year-old brother. Four school students are believed to remain in detention. Mr Darmanin earlier said 51 French Muslim organisations, including charities and NGOs, would be inspected by government officials and closed down if they were found to be promoting hatred. He said police would also be interviewing about 80 people who were believed to have posted messages in support of the killing. Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam Also on Tuesday, the French government ordered a mosque to close for sharing videos on Facebook calling for action against Mr Paty and sharing his school's address in the days before his death. The Pantin mosque, which has about 1,500 worshippers and is situated just north of Paris, will close for six months on Wednesday. The mosque expressed ""regret"" over the videos, which it has deleted, and condemned the teacher's killing. A divided nation exposed  Beneath the public outrage there is a divided nation. A growing number of people believe France's rules on secularism and freedom of speech need to change. Around 29% of Muslim respondents told a recent poll that Islam was incompatible with the values of the French Republic - a sharp increase over the past few years. And among those under 25, the figure was much higher. The number of people who think violence is justified in response to cartoons of Muhammad is very small. But teachers in some areas say that view is growing among their pupils. The roots of this rebellion against French national values are complex - conflicts abroad, racism, lack of opportunity and government policy all play a role.  It's hard to support the values of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity if they don't appear to apply to you. Before this attack, President Macron had already promised a new law to target ""separatism"". But will it tackle the growing chasm or deepen the fault-lines once more? Why was Samuel Paty targeted? On Monday, anti-terrorism prosecutor Jean-FranÃ§ois Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech earlier in October. The history and geography teacher advised Muslim students to leave the room if they thought they might be offended. Mr Ricard said that the killer went to the school on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher. He then followed Mr Paty as he walked home from work and used a knife to attack him. image copyright AFP image caption Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had been threatened over showing the cartoons Tuesday evening's silent vigil in Conflans-Sainte-Honorine was attended by thousands.

The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation. The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state. It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research. Phishing emails IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020.  It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions. This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"".  Malicious code For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about. The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email. They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials.  That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines.  ""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says. 'Precision targeting' IBM says the wider targeting included: the European Commission's Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union companies involved in manufacturing solar panels, which can be used to keep vaccines cold in places where reliable power is not available a South Korean software-development company a German website-development company, which supports clients associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, container transport, biotechnology and manufacturers of electrical components for communications media caption Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats.  ""The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity,"" the US company said.  ""Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation."" Intelligence gathering IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities. The US's  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert  encouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccine  to be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report . In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford.  The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research.  Officials suggested the activity so far had been about intelligence gathering rather than disruption of any research.

In a report, the charity says that species at risk of global extinction have seen their Canadian populations fall by over 40% between 1970 and 2016. Populations of species that are at risk of extinction in Canada itself fell even more dramatically - by 59%. The report said human activity was mostly to blame. Wednesday's report  is based on the Living Planet Index, which measures the ecological performance of 883 species around the world, including the North Atlantic Right Whale and the Barren Ground Caribou. The report found that endangered species were likely to face at least five threats, such as habitat loss, land and shoreline developments and pollution, and that human-activity was mostly to blame. Climate change and biodiversity loss accelerated the impacts of those threats the animals were already facing, the report said. ""Conservation actions that target only a single threat are unlikely to successfully stop and reverse wildlife declines as threats to species are often cumulative or synergistic and can have cascading effects,"" the report said. In the case of the Right Whale, climate change shifted the whale's migratory pattern to more commercial areas where they became vulnerable to ship strikes and more frequently became entangled in shipping gear. The people risking their lives to save Canada's whales Humans blamed for mass wildlife loss The report also pointed to recent research  that found that indigenous-managed lands had more species than other parts of Canada, and better supported at-risk wildlife. The report suggested working with Canada's indigenous people to create more Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas. Canada is not alone in this crisis.  A recent study found that humans have pushed 500 mammals , birds, reptiles and amphibians to the brink of extinction.

""I have nearly 10,000 accounts blocked."" We've all struggled over the past year, going in and out of lockdown, but for 19-year-old Phoebe there's been no escape online. She was first trolled after posting body positive photos and messages on social media. And she reckons the pandemic made things worse. A photo Phoebe posted to mark International Women's Day in March last year sparked a torrent of abuse and attracted ""hundreds of comments"" about how she looked. 'It's every single day' ""This kept happening across the whole of 2020. It got to the point where from July, I have not had a week's break from any online abuse.  ""In these last couple of months, it's been every single day, there will be something or some incident or some comment."" Phoebe has been reporting abusive posts and blocking accounts that were sharing them. Half of women and non-binary people polled by online abuse charity Glitch and the End Violence Against Women Coalition say they've experienced online abuse since the pandemic began. And a poll of 2,000 people for the National Children's Bureau, which was published in November 2020, suggests that more people were experiencing and reporting online abuse as bullying in schools decreased - because most people were learning from home. image copyright Phoebe Jameson image caption Phoebe says she uses social media to try to ""be the woman the teenage me didn't have"" Phoebe says comments and DMs led to her making a suicide attempt in December. ""It got to the point where the comments made me feel like I couldn't be here anymore, really. I ended up in hospital."" When she later posted about her suicide attempt online she received more abuse. ""It was horrific. I just logged off for the rest of Christmas and New Year to just enjoy it and not think about what's being said online,"" she says. ""I'm not in that place now, but I can't say I'm not going to be in that place again from trolling because, I didn't think that would ever happen to me, I never thought it would reach that point."" 'Hyper-disgust' during pandemic Imran Ahmed is the CEO of the Centre for Countering Digital Hate. He says there has been an ""industrial level of trolling"" during the coronavirus pandemic, and part of this has included online bullying. ""Right now we are primed to think of things that aren't like us as being dangerous,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Think about literally what Covid is - someone you love could kill you, just by coming near you.  ""So we're primed to think, I don't want to see people, I don't want to get too close. We are in a hyper-disgust phase."" He says people who troll others online don't get a thrill from the abuse they send, but from seeing the reaction from their victim. ""If you give them what they want and show anger and pain that incentivises them to gain that pleasure again. ""By taking away the possibility of gaining that pleasure, by blocking them, they'll stop."" He also says defending someone against trolls can sometimes do more harm than good because you ""rebroadcast, compound and worsen the abuse."" He says blocking and reporting abusive posts and accounts is still our best option, but also to remember that extreme cases may be against the law. 'I shouldn't have to step away' When Phoebe reported the death threats to her local police, they recommended she log off social media. She did that in the short term for her mental health, but it isn't something she wants to do permanently. ""This is becoming part of my life more especially  because we're all virtual now,"" Phoebe says. ""I don't want to have to censor myself, I think that's the other thing. I tried to be a positive person for others and for my teenage self. I'm trying to be the woman that my teenage self never had. ""It gets tough but I don't feel like I should have to step away because some people don't want me to be existing in that space."" Avon and Somerset police, who Phoebe reported her situation to, says on its website that its  officers will deal with online abuse  only in the most extreme cases. These include a threat to someone's life, targeting specific individuals and persistent harassment and ongoing abuse. image copyright Phoebe Jameson Phoebe's decided not to pursue matters with the police. But she does want social media companies to make it harder to set up fake account on their platforms - which is where a lot of the abuse she experienced came from. She's set up an organisation called The Speak Up Space, where victims of sexual violence and harassment can share their stories and look for help and advice. And despite the abuse she receives, still feels like the positives of being social media outweigh the negatives. ""It was nice when I had a break, I just stuck to WhatsApp to stay in touch with friends and it felt like a weight lifted. But I also love the community I'm in and I love all these friends I've made and all these people who reach out to me and say these lovely things,"" she says. ""I don't want to be pushed out or something. And if I choose to leave, that's going to be my decision.

He named the suspect as Abdoulakh A. - an 18-year-old man, born in Moscow of Chechen origin. He came to France with refugee status as a boy and was unknown to anti-terrorism police. He lived in the Normandy town of Ãvreux, about 100km (62 miles) from the murder scene and had no apparent connection with the teacher or the school. The man had been before courts but only on minor misdemeanour charges. media caption Jean-Michel Blanquer: ""What happened is beyond words"" He went to the college on Friday afternoon and asked students to point out the teacher, Mr Ricard said. The attacker followed Mr Paty, who was heading home on foot after school, inflicted multiple wounds to the head with a knife and then beheaded the victim. Witnesses are said to have heard the attacker shout ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is Greatest"".  The man then posted photos of the victim to a Twitter account, along with insults to Mr Macron and French ""infidels"" and ""dogs"". image copyright Getty Images image caption The scene of the killing has been sealed off and investigation is under way As police approached him, he fired rounds from an airgun at police, Mr Ricard said. They returned fire. The suspect tried to get up and was shot again, being hit nine times in all. A 30cm-long (12in) blade was found close by. What about the investigation? Mr Ricard said Mr Paty had been the target of threats since he showed the cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad during a class about freedom of speech, in relation to the Charlie Hebdo case. image copyright AFP image caption Samuel Paty, a well-liked teacher, had been threatened over showing the cartoons The French satirical magazine was the subject of a deadly attack in 2015 after publishing the cartoons. A trial over that attack is currently under way. Mr Paty, a history and geography teacher, advised Muslim students to look away if they thought they might be offended. Blasphemy row in France over teen's post on Islam Charlie Hebdo republishes Muhammad cartoons  Charlie Hebdo attack: Three days of terror Paris attacks: 'I am not Charlie' A parent of one of the pupils reacted angrily to the incident, accusing Mr Paty of showing naked pictures of the Prophet Muhammad. The father lodged a formal complaint and produced videos demonstrating the anger at Mr Paty's actions, and calling on people to go to the school to protest. The father is one of the people in custody, Mr Ricard said, adding that this man's half-sister had joined the Islamic State organisation in Syria in 2014. At least one of the other people arrested was known to anti-terrorism police, he said, with other links being investigated. And at least four of the 10 now arrested are relatives of the attacker. Mr Ricard said this was the second attack since the Charlie Hebdo trial got under way. A man attacked and wounded two people outside the magazine's former offices. Mr Ricard said there was an ""ongoing extremely high level of terrorism threat on French soil"". Teachers across France told journalists of their fear, stunned by the targeting of a colleague murdered in broad daylight in a quiet suburban street. Aside from the horror of this killing, there's powerful symbolism too. The education minister said the root of what happened was ""hatred of the Republic"". The passing on of French national values - liberty, equality, fraternity - is seen as a core task of the education system here.   Three weeks after an attack on the former offices of Charlie Hebdo, this latest killing is yet more proof of the fault-lines over secularism and tolerance, which have left blood before in the country's streets. How is France reacting? Students were said to be distraught at the brutal killing of a well-liked teacher. One father wrote on Twitter that his daughter ""is in pieces, terrorised by the violence of such an act. How will I explain to her the unthinkable?""  One of Mr Paty's former students, Martial, 16, said he had loved his job: ""He really wanted to teach us things - sometimes we had debates"".  The French presidency said a national tribute would be held for Mr Paty, and the hashtag #JeSuisSamuel (I am Samuel) began trending on social media, echoing the #JeSuisCharlie call for solidarity after the attack on Charlie Hebdo. image copyright EPA image caption President Macron said he was murdered because he ""taught freedom of expression"" Speaking at the scene hours after the incident, President Macron stressed national unity. ""They will not prevail, they will not divide us,"" he said. Charlie Hebdo on Friday tweeted: ""Intolerance just reached a new threshold and seems to stop at nothing to impose terror in our country."" Education Minister Jean-Michel Blanquer, who met leaders from teaching unions on Saturday, said in a recorded statement that Mr Paty had been killed by the ""enemies of freedom"" and France would ""never back down when confronted by terror, intimidation"". Muslim leaders in France also condemned the attack. ""A civilisation does not kill an innocent person, barbarism does,"" Tareq Oubrou, imam of a mosque in Bordeaux, told France Inter. The Strasbourg-based Assembly of Chechens in Europe said in a statement: ""Like all French people, our community is horrified by this incident."" Related Topics France Islamist extremism"

The blackmailer claimed to have poisoned items in German supermarkets, with traces later found in baby food. Officials in the city of Konstanz say that the threatening email was sent to unspecified food retailers. It is reported to have warned that food would be poisoned throughout Europe unless 11.7m euros were paid. Police are seeking one man seen on camera. A nationwide alert for Germany has been issued after officials in the south of the country last week said they were informed that five jars of baby food had been tampered with. The jars were found to contain ethylene glycol, an odourless toxic liquid. So far there are no reports of any injuries.  The colourless substance has a sweet taste and is known to attract children and animals. Officials have not said which retailers were targeted. ""We are taking the threat very seriously,"" Konstanz deputy chief of police Uwe Stuermer said in a news conference. ""[But] there is no reason for panic or hysteria.""  Police have nevertheless alerted people buying groceries to be aware of suspect packaging which may have been tampered with.  Officers are pursuing a male suspect aged about 50 who appeared in security video footage in a supermarket located in a town near Konstanz. The footage has been made public so that officers can, if necessary, rule him out of their inquiries. Authorities in the south-western state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg have meanwhile pledged to increase the number of food safety checks to try and identify any contaminated items. But they have warned that such measures cannot easily be carried out.  ""The case is difficult because the blackmailer did not say which food will be targeted or what poison he will use,"" a consumer protection official quoted by Reuters said.

Sean Paul Farrell, 35, appeared before magistrates in Belfast after he was arrested and brought back to Northern Ireland. He is charged with attempting to murder the off-duty policeman with an under-car bomb.  The incident happened in Eglinton, County Derry on 18 June, 2015. Mr Farrell, with a previous address at Kilfenora Road, Crumlin, faces a further count of possessing explosives with intent to endanger life. 'Devastating consequences' A detective said the improvised explosive device (IED) planted under the officer's car could have had ""devastating"" consequences. In February this year the High Court in Dublin ordered Mr Farrell's extradition to Northern Ireland. But according to police he went missing the following month. He was detained under a warrant in the Glasgow area on Thursday. 'He will do the same' Opposing bail at Belfast Magistrates' Court, an investigating detective claimed Mr Farrell would go on the run again if released. ""We believe he's a member of the IRA and that he has used his connections within the IRA to leave the Republic of Ireland and get to Scotland,"" he said. ""If he gets out, with all his connections, he will do the same."" District Judge Fiona Bagnall was told the dissident paramilitary organisation remained active and posed a severe threat, targeting police officers, prison staff and members of the judiciary. The detective told the court: ""There have been 200-plus incidents where ATO (Army Technical Officers) have been called to the IRA's work over a 12-month period."" During cross-examination by a defence solicitor, he also confirmed there was no forensic evidence linking Farrell to the under-car bomb. Mr Farrell was allegedly in a stolen car involved in the murder bid a number of hours later, when it was spotted in County Donegal. Disputing police assertions that his client absconded, the lawyer insisted Mr Farrell had attended court throughout the extradition proceedings. But despite offering a Â£10,000 surety, bail was refused due to the risk of flight. Judge Bagnall remanded Mr Farrell in custody to appear again by video-link on 19 June.

The review covers the period from September 2019 to August 2020, so the pandemic occupied an even higher proportion of the agency's efforts after the first lockdown began. In total there were 723 incidents of all kinds, marking close to a 10% rise on the previous period. Of those, 194 were Covid-related. Some of the incidents related to countering nation-state attacks, but most were criminal in nature, the GCHQ division reported. It also disclosed that it had thwarted 15,354 campaigns that had used coronavirus themes as a ""lure"" to fool people into clicking on a link or opening an attachment containing malicious software. Some involved fake shops selling PPE (personal protective equipment), test kits and even vaccines. Vaccine hackers Protecting the NHS and health-related research has been a priority, the report said..  In July, the UK accused Russia  of trying to steal vaccine-related information  through cyber-espionage.  And officials said they had continued to see an ""ongoing threat"" of states targeting the vaccine research-and-delivery programme.  The NCSC said it had scanned more than one million NHS IP (internet protocol) addresses to look for vulnerabilities, and had shared 51,000 indicators of compromise.  It has also carried out ""threat hunting"" to look for security risks on connected devices, and worked on the security of the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app. Aggressive ransomware attacks The NCSC also warned ransomware attacks had become more common. Ransomware locks people out of their computers and demands victims make a blackmail payment to restore access - and even then it is not always granted. The NCSC said it had handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents as in the previous year. These included an attack against Redcar and Cleveland Council which, the officials said, had ""caused considerable damage and disruption"".  The report added the NCSC had observed a growing trend for such attacks to be more targeted and aggressive than previously. Rather than just locking people out of access to their data until a ransom was paid, attackers often warned they would embarrass victims if they refused to comply. ""We have seen the threat of data being leaked,"" Paul Chichester, director of operations, told the BBC. Examples included details of staff salaries being published online. This meant victims were at risk even if they have backed up their data.  However, the NCSC said the UK did not appear to be as heavily targeted as some countries, because British victims were less likely to pay the attackers. Punch-tape replacement The NCSC has also been working to increase skills and diversity in the cyber-security industry.  It said almost 12,000 girls had taken part in its 2020 competition. However, an advert for the government's related CyberFirst campaign  was widely criticised last month for featuring a ballerina  and the slogan ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber"". image copyright Cyber First/UK Government  image caption NCSC has said it was not involved in the creation of the CyberFirst poster The report also highlighted the agency's role in protecting parliament as it became ""virtual"" to prevent hacking of debates or votes.  And it revealed that the NCSC had just updated the system for producing cryptographic keys, which encrypt classified government and military systems.  A new electronic system was introduced to replace old-fashioned punch-tape.

The air raid targeted an abandoned UN peacekeeping facility used as a base for an attack on Sunday against Israeli soldiers on Israeli-occupied territory. The four militants behind that attack were killed in an earlier strike. It was believed to be the first direct assault by IS on Israeli troops in the Golan since Syria's civil war began. The Jerusalem Post newspaper  quoted  Israeli military officials as saying that that the ""abandoned military facility"" in the southern Golan targeted overnight had constituted ""a substantial threat in the area"". image copyright AFP image caption Israel's prime minister praised the response of its troops in the Golan Heights In Sunday's incident, Israeli soldiers came under machine-gun and mortar fire, according to the Israeli military. The air force bombed a vehicle carrying the assailants, whom the military said were members of the IS-linked Khaled Ibn al-Walid Brigade, a Syrian group formerly called the Yarmouk Martyrs' Brigade. No Israeli soldiers were injured in the attack. ""Our forces are prepared on our northern border, and we won't let [IS] elements or other hostile elements use the cover of the war in Syria to establish themselves next to our borders,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. The  Golan Heights , a rocky plateau in south-western Syria, has a political and strategic significance that belies its size.

By Brian Wheeler Political reporter Published 8 January 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Brexit MPs say they now fear for their safety when they go to be interviewed by the media on a green opposite the Houses of Parliament. What is going on? For decades now, College Green has been used as a venue for broadcast interviews.  For MPs, it has the advantage of being convenient - they simply have to stroll across the road from the House of Commons to be guaranteed a bigger audience for their views than they would ever get from speaking in the chamber. For broadcasters, College Green provides the all-important sense of being at the heart the action, and gives them access to a steady stream of willing interviewees. image copyright Getty Images image caption Anti-Brexit demonstrator Steve Bray talks to officers on College Green It has traditionally been seen as a haven for backbenchers eager to get on the airwaves. Broadcast insiders call it the ""honeypot"" - MPs booked to do an interview by one outlet are collared by producers from rival outlets as soon as they come off air and ushered towards another microphone.  Some MPs and ministers prefer to be interviewed in the more controlled, and less muddy, environment of the TV studio. Police under pressure over MP harassment Most broadcasters, including the BBC, have studios at Westminster, not far from College Green - where they can be interviewed ""down the line"" by presenters in another location. College Green has traditionally tended to be pressed into action on big Parliamentary occasions such as budgets or general elections. On really big occasions, the main evening news bulletins will be presented from an elevated platform on College Green, offering a commanding view of the Palace of Westminster all lit up at night for added drama. News presenters don't always have parliamentary passes, so hosting bulletins or news channel segments from within the building itself is not possible. But the extra space and freedom of the open-air studio makes the green a more desirable location anyway. image copyright Getty Images image caption Pro-Brexit demonstrators are also making their voice heard TV cameras were not allowed in the Commons chamber until 1989 - and broadcasters were allowed to film interviews with MPs in the building in only 2000, initially from a glass booth in the central lobby. Strict rules remain about where cameras can be placed. Filming on the green gives broadcasters more control, as well as allowing guests without parliamentary passes to take part in live debates. One thing the broadcasters can't control, of course, is what goes on in the back of their shots. Interruptions by placard-waving protesters are an occupational hazard for anyone filming outside Parliament.  People have every right to stage protests - the roads and greens around Parliament are public rights of way - and, in normal times, there is little real friction. Brexit has changed that dynamic, however. The media has set up what is starting to feel like a permanent tented village, as the story continues to dominate the news bulletins. They might not broadcast from there every day but it has become a focal point for demonstrators. The site is now ringed by metal barriers and the police have increased their presence. The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day.  A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times.""  The Parliamentary authorities have issued revised safety advice to MPs planning to take part in media interviews on the green. media caption Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry Most demonstrators - including the small group of anti-Brexit campaigners who set up their banners and flags outside Parliament every day and the pro-Brexit Leave Means Leave group who join them on occasions - are peaceful, although they have had occasional run-ins with the police and each other. The most dogged of the anti-Brexit protesters, Steve Bray, engages in a daily game of cat and mouse with the broadcasters as he tries to get his slogan in shot. In recent weeks, however, a more aggressive brand of demonstrators, from the pro-Brexit side, have started showing up to harangue and intimidate certain MPs as they make the short journey from the Commons to the green and back again. Commons Speaker John Bercow has described them, in a letter to the Metropolitan Police, as a ""regular coterie of burly white men who are effectively targeting and denouncing members whom they recognise and dislike - most notably female and those from ethnic minority backgrounds"". Journalists, such as the Guardian's Owen Jones, have also been targeted. Sky News's Kay Burley says she has been interviewed three times by police investigating alleged incidents of abuse amid ""the chaos that is College Green at the moment"". She told BBC Radio 5 Live she supported the right of people to protest but ""it has become increasingly vile and aggressive and, yes, intimidating as well"", specifically targeting anti-Brexit Conservative MP Anna Soubry, when she was on air. More than 100 MPs have now called on the Metropolitan Police to do more to protect MPs - the police say they are ready to ""deal robustly"" with any instances of criminal harassment but they have to ""strike a balance"" that allows for protesters to exercise their democratic rights.  A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online far-right campaigner James Goddard.  He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles. He told police outside Parliament they were ""fair game"" and ""if you want a war, we will give you a war"".  Mr Goddard emerged as a DIY far-right campaigner last year as he began to gather followers after campaigning in support of the then-jailed anti-Islam activist, Stephen Lennon aka Tommy Robinson.  Before the incident at Parliament involving Ms Soubry, he'd been helping to organise France-style ""yellow vest"" protests - including attempts to block bridges in London.  Mr Goddard relies on donations from his followers - he frequently runs crowdfunding appeals for his campaigns.  On Tuesday evening, Facebook confirmed it has closed his account.  ""We will not tolerate hate speech on Facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke real-world violence,"" said a spokesman. Minutes later, his separate Paypal crowdfunding page disappeared too. Related Topics Anna Soubry Brexit More on this story Police under pressure over MP harassment Published 8 January 2019"

Police allege competition for control of the towing market has resulted in a ""scene of violence"" in the region. Rival lorry companies were allegedly fighting over not just the profits of towing vehicles, but subsequent insurance frauds.  Police say the turf war was connected to several organised crime groups. ""Their fraudulent billing, fraudulent repairs, [and] fraudulent physiotherapy claims have earned them millions in illicit income,""  said York Regional Police Superintendent Mike Slack said on Tuesday, when announcing the charges. ""And when these profits were not enough they staged collisions using drivers they recruited"". ""As the profits increased, so has the demand for the territory, and the need to control that territory through violence,"" he said. The region has seen at least 30 arson attacks believed to be connected to the towing industry over the past year, and multiple drivers have been shot at or killed,  according to newspaper the Globe and Mail. The crime spree caught the attention of Ontario Premier Doug Ford. ""We're coming for you, and we're going to catch you. The party's over,"" he said last March. The investigation, which was dubbed Project Platinum because of the high-end lorries being used by the companies, involved law enforcement from three police agencies and the Canada Revenue Agency. The public learnt of the turf war last summer, when Toronto Police announced they had arrested seven drivers for gun and drug offences. But Project Platinum, led by York Regional Police, sheds more light on the inner workings of the industry. image copyright York Regional Police The investigation found that the towing companies worked with complicit auto repair shops, car and truck rental companies, and physiotherapy clinics to defraud insurance companies.  Tow truck companies would hire fake drivers to stage accidents on roads and in parking lots, police claim. When a group of insurance companies tried to fight the fraudulent claims in court, their law firm, Carr Law, became the target of violence, threats and extortion, according to police. image copyright York Regional Police image caption Police search a property in Vaughan, Ontario Police searched locations in several cities and towns in the Greater Toronto Area, including Hamilton, Brantford, Vaughan, Richmond Hill, Markham, Oakville, Toronto and the towns of Aurora and East Gwillimbury. Twenty people have been arrested and 191 charges brought forth, including one count of first-degree murder, three counts of attempted murder, and multiple counts of fraud, arson and property damage. Eight of those arrested remain in custody, including Mohamad El-Zahawi, 38, of Toronto, who was just charged with first-degree murder in connection to the death of Soheil Rafipour in 2018. Mr El-Zahawi's next court appearance is on 21 July.  A first-degree murder conviction carries a mandatory minimum sentence of 25 years to life in prison. Police also seized over 40 firearms, 11 tow trucks, and illegal drugs including cocaine, fentanyl and crystal methamphetamine, worth $1m Canadian dollars (Â£590,000). ""With the accused facing charges and their assets seen, we expect the extreme level of violence we have seen in our community to diminish,"" Superintendent Slack said.  Police expect more arrests to follow in the coming months, and they have called on governments to pass regulations for the towing industries. Currently, only 17 of Ontario's 444 municipalities require towing to be licensed, according to the Globe and Mail.

The barriers have drawn criticism from trading partners, including the US. The Trump administration cited the rules as an example of unfair practices when it announced plans for tariffs on Chinese goods earlier this year. However, this week officials appeared to be trying to defuse the tensions between the two countries. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced that his administration did not plan to develop new tools to curb Chinese investment, as he had threatened when the tariffs were announced. Instead, Mr Trump said he would support a congressional effort to expand the power of the Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), which vets foreign deals for national security risks. What is the US planning for investment?  The legislation, which has support from both US parties and is expected to pass, would expand the kind of deals the committee is instructed to review. US weighs plans to curb Chinese investment What is a trade war and why should I worry? It is a response to concerns in the US that China is stealing its intellectual property, at times through acquisitions of US companies. However, it does not necessarily target China and is considered a less draconian measure than the president's earlier threat.  ""I have concluded that such legislation will provide additional tools to combat the predatory investment practices that threaten our critical technology leadership, national security and future economic prosperity,"" Mr Trump said in a statement. What has China done?  A day after Mr Trump's announcement, China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) released a new version of a list outlining industries in which foreign investment is limited or prohibited.  The new list contains 48 industries, compared with 63 on last year's list. Some of the changes, such as those loosening rules for carmakers, were announced previously.  China's commerce ministry also said it would ""closely monitor"" the US legislation. It also said it objects to the US using national security as an excuse to tighten the rules for Chinese companies in the US.    image copyright Getty Images Declining investment Chinese investment in the US has already taken a big hit. The  value of deals by Chinese investors fell by more than 90%  in 2017, according to the Rhodium Group. The American Enterprise Institute (AEI), a conservative US think tank, found that China invested $24.2bn across all sectors in the US last year - a huge drop from 2016, but still the second highest on record.  Chinese companies have invested about $21.6bn in US technology businesses since 2007, according to the AEI.    Analysts attribute some of the decline to controls that China has placed on outbound investment. CFIUS also stymied a number of acquisitions. Looming tariffs The US still plans to  impose tariffs of 25% on $34bn worth of Chinese goods  starting from 6 July, with an additional $16bn potentially to follow.

When Dr Jean-Robert Ngola heard that he had to pick up his daughter last May, he quickly did the maths. His daughter lived in Montreal with her mother, about seven hours away from his home in Campbellton, New Brunswick.  As a family physician, he knew that he needed to be as safe as possible to limit the spread of Covid to others. But as a parent, he had to come get his child so that her mother could attend a family funeral in Africa. In order to get her and have contact with as few people as possible, he hopped in his car and drove all day, spending the night at his brother's before driving her back.  Before leaving, Dr Ngola called the local police, asking for clarity around the laws about self-isolation.   New Brunswick has one of the strictest quarantine policies in Canada. Along with several other eastern provinces, it has formed an ""Atlantic bubble"" - in the early months of the pandemic, most forms of travel into the bubble were restricted, and anyone entering had to quarantine for 14 days. But as a frontline worker, he says police told him he was exempt. Not wanting to leave his patients without a doctor, he decided to go back to work. On 25 May, Dr Ngola heard that one of his patients had been diagnosed with the virus. He got tested, and began to self-isolate with his four-year-old daughter.  At 11am on 27 May, he learned he, too, had the virus, although he had no symptoms.  Then, his life began to fall apart. Within the hour, his identity began to spread online. Later in the afternoon, Premier Blaine Higgs, who leads the provincial government, was chastising him on live television. At least two other people had contracted coronavirus ""due to the actions of one irresponsible individual,"" Mr Higgs said, after nearly two weeks without a single case. image copyright Getty Images Although the premier did not name Dr Ngola directly, by that time, people had connected the dots, and photographs of his office were circulating online. Provincial health officials told the media Dr Ngola had contracted the disease in the neighbouring province of Quebec, and spread it to others because he did not follow the 14-day mandatory quarantine for people who had been out of New Brunswick. But Dr Ngola, and his lawyer Joel Etienne, say the rules were not clear, and Dr Ngola was following the same practices as people around him.  They also dispute the province's claim that he was ""patient zero"". India coronavirus: 'Our neighbours made us Covid-19 pariahs' Students fed up with being blamed for virus spike Although no criminal charges were filed, Dr Ngola faces a civil charge for violating the Emergency Measures Act and could face a fine up to C$10,200 ($7,600, Â£6,000). The case is currently making its way before the courts. His employer, VitalitÃ© Health Network, immediately suspended him without pay for breaking protocols.  ""I was the scapegoat. As soon as my diagnosis is madeâ¦ one hour later, my life changed,"" he said. In a statement to the BBC, a spokesperson for Vitalite confirmed that Dr Ngola's suspension continues, and declined to comment further.  The premier's office did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. The reaction from the community was swift and brutal. Dr Ngola, who is originally from the Democratic Republic of Congo, said people were telling him to ""go back to Africa"" and other forms of racist abuse.  A SIMPLE GUIDE:   What are the symptoms? TEENAGE RITUALS:  Growing up, interrupted SUPERSPREADERS:  What makes some events so risky? Quarantining in his home with his small daughter, he feared for his safety when his address was leaked online and had to go under police protection. But he was also constantly under police scrutiny, he says, because people kept phoning in with bogus ""tips"" claiming to have seen him break quarantine. Dr Ngola says the harassment was so bad, he had to leave the province. He was offered a job in a small community in Quebec, where he has been living for the past several months. He says he feels welcome there, but his experience in Campbellton has left psychological scars.  ""I cannot have the same life because now I'm public,"" he says. This is not the first time he's had to start over. Born in the Congo, Dr Ngola had wanted to be a doctor since he was a small child, after coming down with polio and being unable to get the appropriate medical treatment because it was too costly.  ""My childhood ambition was to become a doctor in order that children like myself would be spared,"" he says. He paid his way through school by tutoring other students, and practised medicine during his country's brutal civil war. In 2000, he immigrated to Belgium, where he had to retrain in order to continue to be a doctor. Then five years later, he relocated to Canada, because he felt he would face less prejudice as an African immigrant. Once again, he went back to school in order to practise medicine. Now, he feels disillusioned. Dr Ngola says he believes his race and immigration status played a factor in how he was treated not only by the public at large, but by the province's top officials. image copyright Submitted photo ""What is the difference with me? The difference is I'm black and I'm a foreigner,"" Dr Ngola said.  Although he felt like a pariah at home, around the country his fellow physicians were rallying to his defence. In September, 1,500 physicians signed a letter condemning his treatment, and demanding an investigation into how his name was leaked to the press.  ""All of us signed below have felt tremendous anger, discomfort and frustration with the backlash that followed once you were publicly identified. What unravelled thereafter was unjust, unkind and dehumanizing,"" the letter, which was spearheaded by Dr Danusha Foster, read. ""We strongly believe that systemic racism coupled with the stigma surrounding individuals infected with the Covid-19 virus have significantly contributed to the crucifixion of your character within the public eye."" Dr Foster, a family physician who lives in Ontario, says that when she first heard about Dr Ngola, she, like many others, judged him. ""We're in a deadly pandemic, and health professionals should be held to a higher standard at this time, because we're supposed to be modelling for the general population what we should be doing,"" she told the BBC. image copyright Submitted photo image caption Dr Denusha Foster But after hearing about the abuse he was suffering, and reading media articles critical of the province's investigation, she began to feel sympathy.  ""He was being judged in the public eye before the facts were known,"" she says. She says patient confidentiality is the ""core"" of the doctor-patient relationship, and whoever leaked his name should be held to account. After talking about his case on online physicians groups, she decided to organise the letter of support, to show Dr Ngola that he wasn't alone.  ""I hadn't even written my letter, and I already had 800 names that wanted to sign,"" she says. ""We realised as we watched this case that what happened to Dr Ngola, could have happened to anyone of us... if we made one little mistake."" Did he break the rules? Over 40 cases and two deaths have been connected to the outbreak in the Campbellton region since 27 May. But it remains unclear if Mr Ngola was the source. Anyone entering New Brunswick from another province outside the Atlantic Bubble is supposed to quarantine for 14 days.  But residents of Campbellton, which is on the border of Quebec, were allowed to cross the border without self-isolating for certain reasons, such as if they worked in Quebec, had to attend a medical appointment in Quebec or if they shared custody of a child in Quebec. According to the provincial guidelines , ""all such workers and individuals who are exempt from self-isolation must travel directly to and from work and/or their accommodations, self-monitor and avoid contact with vulnerable individuals"" Dr Ngola spent about 30 hours in Quebec, including an overnight stay with his brother to rest up after the seven-hour drive. He also saw two colleagues in Trois-Rivieres, although they were masked and socially distanced. He also had contact with a petrol-station employee. Dr Ngola said many of his co-workers went back and forth to Quebec and did not fully self-isolate, so he did not think he was breaking the rules.  image copyright Getty Images His employer, Vitalite Health, told the CBC's Fifth Estate that all workers were ordered to self-isolate after returning to the province unless they lived in Quebec.  Mr Etienne says regardless of whether his client broke the rules, the province failed to do its due diligence before blaming him for the outbreak. He says they had not finished contact-tracing the four individuals in Quebec whom Dr Ngola had contact with, before claiming the doctor was the source of the Covid cluster in New Brunswick. He says their own private investigator found that neither his brother, the two colleagues, nor the gas station employee tested positive for Covid. His daughter, however, did. Both she and her father have made a full recovery.  There had been at least one confirmed case of Covid in Campbellton in the days prior to Dr Ngola's diagnosis, and his lawyer says he could have got it from community spread.

It said the action had been taken on the grounds of national security. President Tayyip Erdogan accuses Mr Gulen of instigating a failed coup against him last July - a charge the cleric denies.   Earlier, authorities  detained more than 1,000 people  in the latest operation against alleged Gulen supporters. The nationwide sweep was one of the largest such operations carried out in Turkey in months. As well as the 1,009 detained on Wednesday, arrest warrants were issued for another 3,224 people, as part of a police operation across Turkey's 81 provinces, reports said. Interior Minister Suleyman Soylu said the raids were targeting a Gulenist network ""that infiltrated our police force, called 'secret imams'"". Turkey under Erdogan: The full story Why did Turkey hold a referendum? In the aftermath of the 15 July coup attempt, which was led by military officers, 40,000 people were arrested and 120,000 sacked or suspended. They included soldiers, police, teachers, and public servants - all of whom were accused of having links with militant groups. A brief guide to Turkey's coup Who is Turkey's pugnacious president? The latest purge comes just over a week after President Erdogan narrowly won a controversial referendum on increasing his powers. Opponents fear the victory, which has bitterly divided Turkey, brings him closer to authoritarian rule. Two days after the referendum, Turkey's parliament extended a nine-month state of emergency by a further three months. Erdogan tightens grip - by Mark Lowen, BBC News, Istanbul It was widely expected that the post-coup purge would accelerate once President Erdogan achieved the referendum victory he wanted.  He feels emboldened and there's no longer a risk of jeopardising potential referendum votes. image copyright Reuters image caption President Erdogan has accused Europe of closing its doors on Turkey No matter that the opposition still contests the referendum results, and their claim of widespread fraud is backed by a scathing report from election observers. The president says the result is final.  So on Wednesday the police bore the brunt of the detentions, but other institutions are likely to follow suit.  The governing AKP party was full of Gulen supporters when Mr Erdogan and the cleric were staunch allies.  It hasn't yet been purged and could now be targeted. And even if not, the threat will be dangled over potential opponents like a sword of Damocles: speak out and your Gulen affiliation will be exposed. The scale of the ""anti-Gulen"" arrests has raised alarm in Europe, and stalled Turkey's bid to join the EU.

Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has  accused Fethullah Gulen  of being behind the failed uprising, but he denies any involvement. Thousands of people suspected of supporting the US-based cleric have been arrested, sacked or suspended from their jobs in Turkey in the past week. But UK-based Gulenists said that it is not just in Turkey that his followers have been singled out. Within a few hours of the president urging people to take to the streets in protest last Friday, the Mevlana Rumi mosque in Edmonton, north London said it was targeted. ""Two people entered the mosque. They started shouting out, swearing, breaking the peace,"" said Seval Gokce, the mosque's executive director.  She added: ""A person standing outside opened up the Turkish flag. Then an hour later, five or six more cars pulled up outside the mosque, shouting out abuse and amongst them, they were heard to say they were thinking of burning down the mosque."" 'Angel of death' Others have been targeted personally.  Ozcan Keles, a member of the mosque and chairperson of the Gulen-inspired charity  Dialogue Society  said he and others received threatening text messages. ""It's signed off by 'the angel of death' and then it's got a second signature which says MIT Special Forces and Operations UK,"" he said. ""It's basically saying: I'm sending this on behalf or I am a representative of the Turkish government and Turkish intelligence services."" image caption Ozcan Keles with Seval Gokce, who said the community is being 'extra vigilant' He said: ""I'm in London. I have nothing to do with what's happening in Turkey. I condemn the coup as much as anyone condemns it."" The  Gulen movement  is not easy to describe.  There is no single identifiable body linking everything together. Instead followers are encouraged to form their own organisations that finance themselves.  'Arouse suspicion' But that has led to criticisms that some organisations are too secretive about their connection to the movement.  Bill Park, a senior lecturer in defence studies at King's College, University of London, said: ""They tend to be a bit coy about their links. ""The fact that they are sometimes coy means not only that they arouse suspicion because you never quite know who you're talking to but also it means you can put this label on anyone you don't trust, don't like or feel is up to something."" As the purge of suspected Gulenists continues in Turkey, it is likely some will be even less keen to identify themselves publicly with the movement. Seval Gokce said the mosque has reported the incidents to the police and she said the community is being extra vigilant. ""For the first time since 2008, we've put a sign on the door showing our opening and closing hours,"" she said. ""We've only shut down from 11 in the evening until four in the morning but it's the first time we're closing the doors between prayers for our own safety.""

Earlier this month, David Cameron announced an RAF-operated drone had killed two Britons linked to so-called Islamic State in Syria, describing the action as an ""act of self defence"". MP Caroline Lucas and Baroness Jones have now sought permission for a judicial review of the policy, claiming that ""targeted killing"" is unlawful.  It is backed by campaigners Reprieve.  Britain is participating in air strikes against IS fighters in Iraq, but not Syria - after the Commons refused to approve the action two years ago. But in what was the first targeted UK drone attack on a British citizen, Reyaad Khan, from Cardiff, and Ruhul Amin, from Aberdeen were killed by a remotely piloted aircraft on 21 August in Raqqa, Syria. Khan, the target of the strike, had been plotting ""barbaric"" attacks on UK soil, the prime minister told MPs in a statement. media caption David Cameron: ""We took this action because there was no alternative"" He insisted the action was lawful despite Parliament not having authorised airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria.  He said the attorney general had been consulted and agreed there was a ""clear legal basis"" for the strike. But Ms Lucas and Baroness Jones - the party's sole representatives in Parliament - say there has been a lack of parliamentary scrutiny or approval of the policy and argue there have been conflicting and partial accounts of the justification in statements. In his statement to MPs on 7 September 2015, David Cameron also said: The strike had been approved at a meeting of ""the most senior members"" of the National Security Council, and authorised by Defence Secretary Michael Fallon The UK acted under the ""inherent right of self-defence"" contained in the Charter of the United Nations, based on evidence from intelligence agencies British security forces had foiled six attempted terror attacks in the UK in the past year The UK had a ""moral responsibility"" to help people fleeing the Syrian conflict and would accept up to 20,000 refugees from Syria over the next five years In a letter to the Ministry of Defence and the attorney general's office, they argue that the government has either failed to formulate a policy or, if it has a policy, failed to publish it. Either eventuality, they argue, is unlawful.  ""If any pre-authorised and targeted killing can be lawful, they must be carried out under a formulated and published Targeted Killing Policy which ensures transparency, clarity and accountability for such use of lethal force,"" the letter says. 'Kill policy' The drone strike is expected to be the subject of an investigation by the Intelligence and Security Committee of the House of Commons, now chaired by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve. Reprieve, an international human rights charity, said the government's justification of the strike effectively gave it ""the power to kill anyone, anywhere in the world, without oversight or safeguards"". ""This is a huge step, and at the very least the prime minister should come clean about his new kill policy,"" said its legal director Kat Craig. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it was effectively a ""wholesale adoption"" of the US government's ""so-called targeted killing programme"". The drone strikes have been backed by Conservative MPs, who said the individuals targeted posed a direct threat to national security. But Labour has called for the attorney general's advice to be published, something ministers say there is no precedent for.

Andreas Dowling from Torpoint, Cornwall admitted 30 counts of communicating false information with intent. He was sentenced at Exeter Crown Court to four years and five months. Judge Mrs Justice May said the 24-year-old's actions were ""pernicious and nasty"" and calls targeting Jewish schools were racially motivated. Dowling made threats to about 70 schools in the UK, affecting more than 44,000 pupils, and various locations in the US and Canada. He was fascinated by computers from the age of six and studied network and software development at Cornwall College. The court was told he also had a good knowledge of security systems. His motivations varied and included racism, punishing the US Government for perceived corruption, and closing schools for pupils in return for payment, the court heard.  He lived with his mother and used software to disguise his voice. 'Extreme anxiety' In 2015 he made repeated bomb threats to the Super Bowl in Arizona but the event went ahead. The following year he targeted the Palace of Westminster - his only non-education target in the UK - saying a bomb was attached to a parked vehicle and there was 30 minutes to evacuate, but it was correctly identified as a hoax.

The Counter-Terrorism and Security Bill would allow the home secretary to impose temporary exclusion orders on British terror suspects. There have been calls for ministers to change the proposals to allow judicial oversight of the orders. In other measures, universities and councils would be required to take steps to counter radicalisation. The new legislation, which receives its second reading in the House of Lords on Tuesday, also includes:  Changes to TPIMs - Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures - to allow the authorities to force suspects to move to another part of the country Requiring internet providers to retain internet protocol address data to identify individual users Raising the burden of proof for imposing TPIMs from ""reasonable belief"" to ""balance of probabilities"" Greater powers to disrupt people heading abroad to fight - including  cancelling passports  at the border for up to 30 days  Tighter aviation security - requiring airlines to provide passenger data more quickly and effectively Banning insurance companies from covering ransom payments Forcing firms to hand  details to police identifying who was using a computer  or mobile phone at a given time Under the exclusion orders proposal, Home Secretary Theresa May would be able to sign an order to ban a suspected extremist from returning to the UK, for up to two years at a time. The individual could return if they agreed to some kind of investigation or monitoring arrangements to ensure they were not a threat. Labour has called for a judge to have a role when the orders are imposed. This view was echoed by David Anderson QC, the government's independent reviewer of terror legislation. He told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""If you are going to give these very powerful instruments to the home secretary to decide that she believes someone is a terrorist and they should be constrained in their movements for two years or so, you have absolutely got to have proper judicial safeguards, otherwise you end up fuelling the whole grievance agenda that is at the root of the terrorism in the first place."" Immigration and Security Minister James Brokenshire said the measures contained in the bill were a ""considered and targeted"" response to the terror threat, ""These important new powers will only be used when it is necessary and proportionate and are subject to stringent safeguards and oversight,"" he added.

The plan unveiled at talks in Morocco addresses terms of a truce and disarmament of armed groups. UN special envoy Bernardino Leon urged the Libyans to back the proposal. Since the overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, Libya has descended into chaos and seen jihadist groups fighting for control of the oil-rich nation. Islamic State (IS) militants have recently managed to gain a foothold in Libya's cities of Derna and Sirte. On Tuesday, the militants said they had seized a power plant near Sirte, which a military source confirmed, Reuters news agency reports. According to the privately owned Libyan al-Wasat newspaper, the insurgents took the facility after a militia linked to the authorities in Tripoli withdrew. The BBC's North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad says with the gradual spread of IS, most of Libya's warring militias are now facing a common threat that did not exist when they declared war on each other. This may prove to be the one element that forces them to work together, she adds. Analysis: BBC North Africa correspondent Rana Jawad, Tunis This latest draft will be attractive to Libya's political rivals, but is unlikely to please the country's warlords. The threat of targeted UN sanctions on individuals may help to get agreement. Key to implementing large parts of the agreement appears to be the creation of a legitimate armed force, which will be a long and difficult process.       The delegates taking part in the current dialogue will oversee the deal's implementation and have some short-term decision-making powers. If adopted, it could put Libya back on track if all militias fall into line - or spark a wider conflict if the militias oppose disarmament. And as has happened in recent years, new militia alliances could take shape. ""Today, the people of Libya have their eyes on this gathering, on you, in the hope that you'll save your country and your people from protracted conflict,"" Mr Leon told Libya's two rival governments at the talks in Skhirat. ""I am full of hope that this draft represents a fair and reasonable way forward."" The UN plan calls for a one-year-long national unity government and says that the parliament elected in 2014 is the only legislative body. However, it says a High Council of State should be formed with 120 members - many of them from the rival parliament - to be Libya's ""highest consultative body"" with ""binding opinions"". A council, made up of the prime minister and four other politicians, has also been proposed to be in control the armed forces. Libya's rival power bases Why is Libya so lawless? Islamic State gains Libya foothold Currently, Libya's internationally recognised parliament is based in the eastern port of Tobruk.  Its rival, the Islamist-dominated General National Congress, is nearly 1,000km (620 miles) to the west in the capital, Tripoli. Representatives of both groups - who have made no public comments on the UN proposal - are expected to reconvene for talks later this week. ""What I can say is at the end of this week, we will have a very clear idea on who is for peace who is not, and that will help us to focus our efforts in the future,"" the US ambassador to Libya, Deborah Jones, was quoted as saying by Reuters.

Right-wing Senator Giuseppe Moles of Forza Italia spoke out publicly, warning the minister that credibility was like virginity and ""easy to lose"". Furious senators in her Five Star party demanded that Mr Moles apologise. A deputy health minister and a regional governor also have police guards now. The deputy minister, Pierpaolo Sileri, had received threats linked to coronavirus aid. Like Ms Azzolina, he is in the  anti-establishment Five Star movement, part of Italy's coalition government. Attilio Fontana, governor of the Lombardy region - epicentre of Italy's coronavirus crisis - was also assigned police protection after being threatened on social media. Graffiti in Milan labelled him a ""murderer"".  He is in Matteo Salvini's anti-immigration League, and his Lombardy government has been heavily criticised for shortcomings in its crisis response, such as shortages of some medical kit in the severely stretched health service. media caption The mental health toll as Italians struggle to cope with Europe's strictest and longest-running lockdown Austria's Justice Minister Alma Zadic, a Green politician, was  reported to be under police protection in January  after being targeted by far-right threats on social media.   What the senator said During question time in the Senate on Thursday Senator Moles unleashed a tirade against Ms Azzolina, 37, who is battling to address widespread frustration over the paralysis in education caused by the coronavirus crisis. ""We've heard so much: school closing yes, school closing no; in April all students will be promoted, in May some students will fail; in September lessons can be half at school, half at home,"" he said. ""I remind you minister that school requires credibility and seriousness. And credibility is like virginity: easy to lose, difficult to maintain, and impossible to recover."" Ms Azzolina did not hit back at the senator - her social media posts have focused on her plans to get Italy's students back into class, while ensuring that protection against coronavirus is in place. Unlike some other countries, Italy is delaying the reopening of schools until September. 'We all became heroes but they've already forgotten us' Italy restriction easing a 'calculated risk' Blue dress upstages Italy's macho politicians Italy battles for both mind and body Colleagues sprang to the minister's defence. Five Star Senator Barbara Floridia called on Mr Moles to apologise. His comment comparing credibility to virginity was even more serious, she said, because it had been made ""in front of a woman, a minister, who has in recent days suffered every kind of attack and insult"" which meant she needed police protection. New rules for schools A decree for schools has been adopted by the Senate - the upper house of parliament - including a host of new hygiene rules drafted by a scientific expert panel. There will be a one-metre social distancing rule in classrooms, compulsory masks for those aged over six and staggering of school timetables to keep student numbers down. Anyone with a temperature of 37.5C will have to stay at home. Among those who attacked Ms Azzolina on social media was Vittorio De PrÃ , a maths teacher at a secondary school in Ovada, a small town in Piedmont, northern Italy. He now faces possible suspension for sexist abuse, the daily La Stampa reports. He apologised, saying: ""shut up at home for some time, exasperated by this situation, I let myself go and wrote what everyone has read and rightly condemned.  ""I was anxious because nothing was known about the state exams for high school and there was talk of teachers having to be present for the tests. I also have health problems.

The laser was shone into the cockpit of the Sea King Mark 5 while it supported an operation to recover a woman from the water at Saltcoats on Monday night.  The incident is said to have caused the crew ""considerable distraction"". The Royal Navy described the targeting of the crew as ""extremely reckless and irresponsible behaviour"". The aircraft, from HMS Gannet at Prestwick, was called to the rescue operation in Saltcoats at about 22:00.

The proposal to reduce emissions in the US would see investment in clean energy infrastructure over a four-year period.  ""Let's not waste any more time,"" Mr Biden said at a campaign event in his home state of Delaware on Tuesday, adding: ""Let's get to work, now."" His focus on climate issues is in contrast with President Donald Trump. Mr Trump has previously called climate change ""mythical"" and ""an expensive hoax"", but also subsequently described it as a ""serious subject"". ""When Donald Trump thinks about climate change, the only word he can muster is hoax,"" Mr Biden said at the Build Back Better campaign event in Wilmington. ""When I think about climate change, the word I think of is jobs."" The former vice-president added: ""We're not just going to tinker around the edges."" Biden challenges Trump with 'buy American' plan Who could be Joe Biden's running mate? All you need to know about the presidential race Mr Biden's campaign staff said they would provide details of how the plan to ""produce power without producing carbon pollution"" would work and how it could be funded in the coming weeks.  The Democratic presidential candidate has previously pledged to raise taxes on large corporations and reverse Mr Trump's tax cuts for high earners. Mr Biden also said he would re-join the Paris climate agreement, which Mr Trump withdrew the US from in 2017. As election day approaches and his polling lead holds firm, Joe Biden is getting more ambitious with his proposed first-term presidential agenda.   The latest move, addressing the threat of climate change, targets a top issue for many in the liberal grass roots of the Democratic Party. The former vice-president's original proposal, unveiled last year, included spending $1.7tn on infrastructure and green jobs over 10 years. It was largely rejected by environmental activists as too little, too slowly.  His latest plan, $2tn over four years, is getting a much more enthusiastic reception, including from groups like the Sunrise Movement, which endorsed Bernie Sanders in the Democratic primaries and have viewed Mr Biden with scepticism. At the very least, Mr Biden's announcement could help shore up his political left flank as he prepares to face off against Donald Trump in November. Conservatives have been quick to condemn the plan as big-government profligacy, but the scope of Mr Biden's proposal could reflect rapidly shifting views on what is possible in a political world reshaped by the coronavirus.  Massive government spending and trillion-dollar budget deficits are already a reality. Mr Biden's goal, with his big-ticket climate-change proposal, is to keep the fiscal ball rolling toward his party's priorities.  Responding to Mr Biden's proposal, Trump campaign spokesman Hogan Gidley said it read ""like a socialist manifesto that promises to massively raise taxes, eliminate jobs in the coal, oil or natural gas industries, and crush the middle class"".  "" There is no way he can sell this radical agenda to union workers  in energy-producing, manufacturing, or auto industry states like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, or Wisconsin,"" Mr Gidley added.  The economy is expected to be a key theme of the 2020 US presidential election, which is due to be held on 3 November.  It will take place following the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has pushed tens of millions of Americans into unemployment.

The Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) said unsuspecting consumers handed over a total of Â£3.7m to fraudsters in 2013.  Among the 4,555 reports were 22 victims who lost Â£10,000 or more. Almost half the cases involved flight or concert and festival tickets, although people buying tickets for sporting events were also targeted.  Fraud reports peaked in the summer music festival season, Acpo said, and spiked for flight tickets again in December. The association said scams were typically carried out over the internet. Acpo's national co-ordinator for economic crime, Commander Stephen Head, said the problem was getting worse. ""Millions of pounds were lost last year and millions more could go the same way in 2014,"" he warned. ""Taking a punt on an unofficial seller, be it over the internet or face-to-face, is just not worth the risk."" 'Growing threat' Cdr Head, of the City of London Police, said the responsibility for tackling the con artists lay with ticket distributors, as well as the police:  ""I am calling on the industry to take a long hard look at the way tickets are sometimes sold in this country to ensure their processes are as resilient as they possibly can be to the growing threat of fraud."" Acpo pointed to research by the National Fraud Intelligence Bureau which suggested fraudsters prepare for summer music festivals through the autumn and winter months. It said a common method used by scammers was to claim the cost of flights had risen and demand more money. If the buyer tried to cancel, a ""cancellation"" fee would be added, even though in many cases no flights had ever been booked by the fraudsters, Acpo said.  In the festival season fraudsters would typically produce a certificate of authentication to persuade music fans to hand over their money. Thursday sees the start of a week-long police campaign to target the criminals in ""hotspots"" around the country.

Known for its coral reefs, mangroves and white sandy beaches, 360,000 tourists travel to the Indian Ocean archipelago each year for a holiday of a lifetime.   But look beyond the private islands, the boutique resorts and high-end restaurants, and the small nation is battling a heroin epidemic of huge proportions.   Between 5,000 and 6,000 people out of a total population of 94,000 - the equivalent of nearly 10% of the working population - are addicted to heroin, according to the Agency for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation (APDAR) in the Seychelles. Per capita, the Seychelles suffers from the highest rate of heroin abuse in the world.     BBC I was smoking heroin two to three times a day, even stealing from my grandmother to pay for my habit"" Jed Lesperance Recovering drug addict Jed Lesperance was 20 years old when he first started taking drugs. He is 34 now. ""I started smoking cannabis with my friends every now and again. At first it was fun,"" he said. ""But over time I graduated to heroin and it started taking over my life. I was smoking heroin two to three times a day, even stealing from my grandmother to pay for my habit. Within a few weeks, I had become addicted,"" he said. Heroin makes the long journey from Central Asia, especially Afghanistan, before being smuggled to the islands via East Africa. Made up of 115 islands, the Seychelles has many porous borders, which makes them hard to monitor and easy for drugs to come into the country. Morning methadone clinics But rather than attempting a ""war on drugs"", which would criminalise the large proportion of heroin users in the Seychelles, the head of the anti-drug agency has introduced a Portuguese-style drug policy - considering drug addiction as a chronic disease to be treated.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Drug addiction is considered a chronic disease in Seychelles ""The Agency for the Prevention of Drug Abuse and Rehabilitation was established in August 2017 and we introduced the Methadone Maintenance Programme (MMP) in May 2018,"" Patrick Herminie told the BBC.  Heroin users have two options: To join a high-threshold MMP, which includes a period of in-patient treatment where they must commit to detoxification Or the low-threshold programme, which focuses on harm reduction Individuals have access to medical and psychosocial support under both programmes. ""Currently, we have over 2,000 people registered in one of our programmes and 68% of those are now gainfully employed,"" Mr Herminie said. Mr Lesperance is one of those people who has benefitted from joining a rehabilitation programme set up by the agency.   Each morning, he visits one of the country's roaming methadone clinics - white vans that are manned by drug counsellors and qualified nurses to give the correct dose of methadone to recovering addicts. image caption Jed Lesperance takes methadone and has been clean for three months Dozens of people line up outside the open windows of the white van ready to show their ID. Their name, the date and time are logged into a spreadsheet and on receipt of the information, the correct dose of methadone is distributed to them.  Mr Lesperance, who has been clean for three months, now works as a pastry chef in a five-star hotel on Mahe, the largest island in the Seychelles.  ""Since I found work, I have a lot more stability and it has encouraged me to stay on the programme. ""I have also been able to give some of the money I earn back to my grandmother, which has made our relationship a lot better,"" he said. More on drugs in Africa: How addict Jesus survived South Africa's drug epidemic Prescription drugs sold illegally in Uganda How a codeine investigation changed Nigeria Michelle Sabury, who helps recruit drug addicts on to rehabilitation programmes, agrees that ""he is a completely different person"". ""When he first came to us, he was underweight and had very little hope. Now he looks a lot healthier and is able to go to work each day. We are proud of what he has achieved,"" she told the BBC.  After receiving methadone, many of those enrolled in the programme stay to talk with their peers or a counsellor before heading off to work or back home.  Some arrive with family members in tow, illustrating how the stigma attached to treatment in the Seychelles is slowly disintegrating. 'My boyfriend was a dealer' One of the counsellors, Levina Mosses, is a reformed heroin addict who now comes to offer support to others hoping to get clean.       BBC The heroin epidemic has touched so many people in my country, it's only right to be open and honest about the problems we are facing"" Levina Mosses Drugs counsellor ""I started talking heroin when I was 17 years old. My boyfriend was a dealer at the time, so I never had to pay for drugs.  ""But after years of heroin abuse, I had had enough. My only option was to get clean."" Ms Mosses left her boyfriend, also the father of her children, 11 years ago - and has been clean ever since.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The former British colony's economy depends heavily on the fishing industry and upmarket tourism. ""I think it's important to get support from people who have been in similar situations so they can see what it is like to come out of it on the other [side]. ""The heroin epidemic has touched so many people in my country, it's only right to be open and honest about the problems we are facing,"" she said.  Following the rollout of the rehabilitation programmes, the price of heroin in the Seychelles has plummeted.  Five things about Seychelles: Popular with tourists after  overcoming history of coups and mutinies following independence The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge spent their honeymoon there in 2011 The archipelago has a high per capita income, good health care and education Much of the land on its 115 islands is  protected as part of nature reserves Home to the endangered  Aldabra giant tortoises ""A line of heroin - around 0.1g - used to cost around 1,000 rupee [$73; Â£57] but now it can be bought for around 30 rupee,"" said the anti-drug agency head. ""The main aim [is] to undermine all of the work that we have done in rehabilitating the population and get people using again, but we are determined to keep up the fight,"" he said. However, there is another threat mounting in the Seychelles as the popularity of synthetic drugs is now on the rise.  ""We don't have any official numbers as yet but anecdotally, we have heard that dealers are starting [to] get their hands on new drugs, drugs that we cannot treat with methadone,"" Mr Herminie said.

Dozens of police officers were injured and scores of people arrested. The protests also saw the middle-ground Alliance Party targeted, including a death threat against East Belfast MP Naomi Long and councillors' homes attacked in Bangor and Newtownards. How did the protests start? On Monday 3 December, 2012, Belfast City Council voted to fly the union flag at city hall only on designated days.  Nationalists at Belfast City Council had wanted the union flag taken down altogether, but in the end voted on a compromise from the Alliance Party that it would fly on designated days. Unionists said they considered the changes to be an attack on their cultural identity.  A loyalist protest outside the building erupted into violence minutes after the motion was passed. Disorder also broke out in east Belfast. Fifteen police officers were injured, as well as a press photographer and two security guards. Police were criticised by Sinn FÃ©in for not anticipating the violence. Council staff removed the flag at 07:00 GMT on Tuesday. It is now only flown on 18 designated days. Why is the issue important to unionists? Parades and flags are important symbols to loyalists, who describe them as expressions of their culture. The decision at Belfast City Hall followed a difficult, but not explosive, marching season during which there were numerous arguments and disturbances over specific parades.  Many loyalists claimed that some nationalists were trying to erase their identity from Northern Ireland.  The unionists argued that the flag had flown for decades above Belfast City Hall and the other parties should have left it alone. Were loyalist paramilitaries involved? Former Police Service of Northern Ireland chief constable Matt Baggott told a press conference on 7 January 2013, after four successive nights of disorder in east Belfast: ""I am concerned that senior members of the UVF in east Belfast -  as individuals - have been increasingly orchestrating some of this violence.  ""That is utterly unacceptable and is being done for their own selfish motives. There is no excuse whatsoever for violence, as we've said, and we will be investigating that and taking the appropriate action."" Previously, assistant chief constable Will Kerr had said members of both the Ulster Defence Association (UDA) and Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) had been involved in violence around flag protests and that ""we're now seeing senior members actively involved in orchestrating the violence."" How did the protests spread? In the weeks before the city hall vote, up to 40,000  leaflets  criticising Alliance were distributed in a joint operation carried out by Democratic Unionist Party and Ulster Unionist Party activists. image copyright Pacemaker image caption The Alliance Party became an object of loyalist wrath Alliance accused the unionists of a blatant attempt to ramp up tensions over the union flag issue. Unionists insisted their defence of the flag was a matter of principle and they wanted peaceful, constructive protests. However, with the involvement of loyalist elements, and others using social media, the protests took on a life of their own, spreading well beyond central Belfast.  Protests followed in towns such as Carrickfergus, Coleraine and Ballymena.  Roads were also blocked in parts of Northern Ireland. The Alliance Party was the target of threats and violence. East Belfast MP Naomi Long was threatened as was councillor Laura McNamee. An Alliance Party office was destroyed in Carrickfergus and councillors' homes attacked in Bangor and Carrickfergus. Why was the Alliance Party a target of loyalist wrath? Alliance holds the balance of power on Belfast City Council, and could have voted down the original motion to remove the flag on all days. Instead it came up with a compromise, suggesting that the union flag should be flown only on designated days.  Many of the party's offices are in unionist and loyalist areas and towns, like Carrickfergus and Bangor and so are an easier target than those of other parties, although two Sinn FÃ©in representatives were also threatened.

Crime in rural parts of England and Wales cost more than Â£800m last year, a survey of 17,000 people suggests.  The National Rural Crime Network (NRCN) said its poll found the average cost to victims was Â£2,500 for rural households and Â£4,000 for businesses.  These crimes, which include theft of tractors and livestock, cost 21 times more than previous estimates, it said.  The Home Office said crime had fallen by 25% since 2010, with rural areas less likely to be affected than towns. 'Uncomfortable reading' The NRCN, which was formed by police and crime commissioners to highlight crime in rural areas, said the estimated figure of Â£800m was based on the average cost of crimes reported in its survey, multiplied by the total number of crimes in rural areas reported from May 2014 to April 2015.  It also took into account the fact its survey suggested that 27% of crimes were not reported in rural areas.   The insurance company NFU Mutual had previously estimated the cost of rural crime in the UK to be  Â£37.8m in 2014 .  Julia Mulligan, chair of the NRCN and police and crime commissioner for North Yorkshire, said: ""Some of the findings in this report make uncomfortable reading but it is vitally important for the reality of rural crime to be fully acknowledged and acted upon.  ""Its actual scale is clearly much greater than we had previously known; Â£800m is a big number. The low satisfaction rates also need to be a wake-up call for police forces in rural areas and everything should be done to harness the opportunities presented.""  image copyright PA image caption Fly tipping is among the greatest concerns of the rural community, the survey suggested The survey found 39% of people in rural areas rated the police as good or excellent compared with 63% across England and Wales.  It found the two greatest concerns to the rural community were road safety (63%) and fly-tipping (61%).  Among seven recommendations made, the NRCN said there needed to be a review of the funding formula for police resources in the countryside. The NRCN said policing for sparsely populated areas was ""relatively expensive on a per capita basis"", which meant resources were under ""even greater pressure"".  In July the government announced it would launch a  consultation  on reforming the Police Allocation Formula, which uses data including population density to determine how much police forces receive.   The NRCN said that police, government and other authorities should work together better. It also called for police resources to be better targeted to ""ensure the assessment of threat, risk and harm is as applicable to rural communities as urban"".  A Home Office spokesman said police and crime commissioners (PCCs) have a ""strong voice in determining how police resources are allocated to tackle the crimes that matter most to them"".  They added: ""This government welcomes the work the National Rural Crime Network is leading to ensure police forces respond to crime in rural areas with the same dedication as crime in urban areas. We trust reports like this will help PCCs hold their forces to account for the services they offer."" The Home Office highlighted the  Crime Survey for England and Wales  and the  Commercial Victimisation Survey  which both suggested crime rates in the countryside were lower than in urban areas.

""We waste scammers' time, we waste their resources and we make them believe they are not as good as they think they are,"" Jill - not her real name - explains to the  BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme . She is part of a global network of so-called scam baiters, who spend their evenings trying to unearth online con artists by pretending to fall for their tricks. The ruses can range from emails saying the recipients have won the lottery, to ""long-lost relatives"" who have left them an inheritance. ""Scammers are always going to be there but if we can take them down a peg and take a victim away from them any time we can, then we are doing something good,"" Jill adds. One of the main techniques, explains Wayne - a scam baiter who often works with Jill - is by leaking scammers' details and their conversation scripts online. The aim is for these to filter through to search-engine results, so potential victims will be alerted if they type in the scammer's name. Wayne says police and other authorities use the data, too. image caption Wayne admits the scam baiters are not always the best people to help police the internet The scam baiters say they do not earn a penny from their work and that they have other reasons for taking on the con artists. One man from the US, who wished to remain anonymous, wanted to turn the tables after his mother was caught up in a ""grandparent scam"", and came close to losing $5,000 (Â£3,900). For Wayne, the motivation is simply the ""buzz"" he receives from knowing he can help someone.  He says people have contacted him via his website on the verge of suicide. Questions remain, however, over whether scam baiters are sufficiently equipped - or best placed - to deal with scammers rather than the authorities. Official advice is to report any suspected offenders to Action Fraud - the UK's national fraud and cyber-crime centre, which focuses much of its resources on prevention and raising awareness.  And Wayne says scam baiters do point people towards the official routes when they feel out of their depth. But Jill argues they still play an important role, as advances in technology and the fact many of the scammers are overseas mean it is difficult for authorities to catch such criminals. And they reject the label vigilante. ""Vigilantes work outside the law,"" says Wayne. 'Twisted' humour Wayne's set-up is rudimentary. He works under various aliases, mostly named after characters from his favourite children's television shows of his youth. He often makes himself seem more vulnerable - and potentially gullible - by pretending to have recently broken up from a partner. ""To bait you do need to have something of a twisted sense of humour,"" he jokes. image copyright iStock Both Wayne and Jill always wait to be approached by scammers, rather than seeking them out. But they don't have to wait long. Their names are on a so-called ""suckers list"" - effectively a database of people thought to be easy to con - which is passed around by scammers online. The latest to get in touch is a man who emails Jill to say she has won the lottery in Africa. Pretending to be husband and wife, Wayne and Jill make a joint call back, the aim being to waste the scammer's time by arguing about which one of them gets the money. Death threat They often have other scam baiters on stand-by who can be brought in to play other characters in their facade, to confuse the scammer - and waste their time - for as long as they wish. Surprisingly, Jill considers her biggest success to be the time she received a death threat from a scammer she had targeted. ""If you get a death threat you know you've really wound someone up. I had one scammer driving round Madrid for a day trying to find 'Lynn', who had gone to Madrid. ""Of course, I hadn't gone to Madrid, I was in my front room. He got so upset and said, 'I'm going to come and find you. I don't care what the penalty for murder is in the UK, I'm going to find you'."" image caption Jill says scammers ""deserve to be treated as criminals"" Jill tells it as a funny anecdote, but it underlines the dangers involved. ""I take great care in protecting my online persona,"" she says. ""I bait with email addresses that aren't traceable. I don't use any of my real-life information. All of my characters are based somewhere 100 miles away from where I live."" Asked whether the death threat suggested scam baiters were taking their cause too far, she firmly disagrees. ""None of us are taking this far enough. These people are criminals. They don't deserve our sympathy. ""They rob our elderly relatives, so they deserve to be treated as criminals. If we could get them arrested, we would."" Watch the  Victoria Derbyshire programme  on weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel.

Russell West, 26, admitted last month that he had sent sexual messages to the Clackmannanshire schoolgirl. West, an officer for Essex Police at the time, was traced after she went missing and her computer was checked by specialist detectives. He has been placed on the sex offenders register for life. Temporary judge Michael O'Grady QC said: ""You pled guilty to indecent behaviour over a fairly lengthy period towards a young and self-evidently vulnerable girl."" The judge said he had concerns about the lengths to which the former police officer had gone to cover his tracks. The court heard in May that West had used a false name to register with an online chat service and used a pay-as-you-go dongle to connect to the internet. Judge O'Grady said he accepted that West had made no attempt to meet up with the schoolgirl. Computer search But he added it was clear that the first offender, who resigned from Essex Police as soon as the crime was detected, still posed a risk. The court heard that West would have been jailed for three years, but for his guilty plea. West will be supervised for three years following his release and was warned he could be returned to custody during that period if he failed to comply with release conditions. Advocate depute Derek Ogg QC said the offence came to light after a search of the missing girl's computer revealed a large number of internet contacts - some of a serious nature. He said: ""There is no suggestion that West's conversation was anything other than fantasy chat. There were no practical attempts to seek a meeting."" Attack threat West targeted the girl after meeting her on an internet chatroom where he used the name ""Fit Essex Guy"". In messages the girl said she was 13 and at school. The investigation into West was part of a major inquiry, codenamed Operation Defender, into internet sex offences against children. Defence counsel Tom Ross said: ""Apart from the commission of this offence he has led a wholly law-abiding existence and contributed to the community through his service in the police force."" West has been held in prison on remand since October last year and Mr Ross said it had been ""a very uncomfortable time for him"" because he was an inmate charged with a sexual offence against a child and a police officer. He added: ""There has been the daily possibility of attack.""

Twitter insults targeting politicians rose from about 10,000 during the 2015 general election to just under 25,000 in the snap election two years later. The best-known politicians got a lot of tweets and abuse - but less well-known MPs got proportionally more abuse. Sheffield University's computer science department carried out the research.

The study  suggests both the volume and proportion of Twitter abuse increased between the two elections.  MPs 'advised to quit Twitter' Female politicians speak out over Twitter abuse MPs speak out on 'sinister' election abuse The research showed abusive tweets made up: 6.6% of Boris Johnson's Twitter timeline in 2015 - and 9.3% in 2017 4.6% of Jeremy Hunt's timeline in 2015, rising to 8.6% 2.5% of Diane Abbott's timeline in 2015, rising to 3.4% Abusive tweets to Ed Miliband dropped from 5.6% when he was Labour leader in 2015 to 3.3% when he returned to the back benches. Nearly 600 of the UK's 650 MPs have a Twitter account, which they use to promote their work in their constituencies, show their support for local causes and engage in debate. But MPs have been warning for several years that the level of abuse they receive has got out of control, with female MPs in particular being targeted, and threats of violence becoming common. In July, the Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said colleagues were being advised to ""close down"" their accounts by Parliament's Health and Wellbeing Service.  Shadow Home Secretary Diane Abbott has spoken about the offensive sexist and racist messages and ""mindless abuse"" she and her staff had to endure every day on social media, not just at election time. Labour's Paula Sheriff has said the 2017 election had been the ""most brutal"" to date. On Thursday, Labour MP Stephen Doughty tweeted an example of a post by Facebook user Philip Price which used offensive language and described him as 'fat' and 'murderous' - and Facebook's response that it did not violate its policies. He said: ""If you wonder why Facebook, Twitter etc are increasingly becoming difficult places, here's another example of abuse we get and the response of the social media companies - who think we deserve a different threshold of abuse 'to allow discourse'."" Responding to the research, Cabinet Office minister Chloe Smith said: ""It is vital that we prevent the rising intimidation of people in public office and those who want to stand for election. ""That is why this government is consulting on new measures that will protect candidates and campaigners standing for public service. We can't let intimidation of people in public life continue unchecked."" Last year  a report by the Committee on Standards in Public Life  said an ""intensely hostile online environment"" had been created and warned people would be put off from entering politics because of the abuse. Update 3 September 2018: This article has been updated to clarify that the example cited by Labour MP Stephen Doughty related to Facebook rather than Twitter.

Conservative MP Nadine Dorries said colleagues were being advised to ""close down"" their accounts by Parliament's Health and Wellbeing Service. The service, which offers counselling to MPs and a 24/7 helpline, said any guidance it gave was confidential. Tory MP Andrew Percy told the BBC that leaving Twitter in 2016 was ""the best thing he has ever done"". The MP for Brigg and Goole said it had not harmed his ability to do his job, either as a minister or in terms of representing his constituents. Nearly 600 of the UK's 650 MPs have a Twitter account, which they use to promote their work in their constituencies, show their support for local causes and engage in debate on national political issues.

Politicians speak out over Twitter abuse MPs speak out on 'sinister' election abuse But MPs have been warning for several years that the level of abuse they receive has got out of control, with female MPs in particular being targeted and threats of violence becoming common. Ms Dorries' confirmation of the advice being given to MPs was in response to  The Spectator's Isabel Hardman 's report. Mr Percy has spoken publicly in the past about the abuse he and his family received during the 2015 election campaign, when he was defending his Brigg and Goole seat spanning north Lincolnshire and east Yorkshire. He said he finally made the decision to do something when a friend saw how ""irritated and angsty"" he became looking at Twitter on Friday nights and Saturday mornings.  He said he had absolutely no regrets about the move, saying he ""could not imagine"" the amount of vilification he would have got if he was still on Twitter during last year's election.  ""I think Twitter is brilliant but it is not just a good space for MPs,"" he said. ""I always say to colleagues, leave Twitter. I have not lost anything by leaving. I don't think it it a tough call. It is the best thing I have ever done in for my own mental health and as a human being. image caption Tory MP Andrew Percy said he had no regrets leaving Twitter ""I don't think it is giving in. It is just taking back control. I feel I have got my life back."" At the time, he estimated just 10% of his 3,000 followers were constituents of his - and a large number were simply trolls. ""You can mute or silence someone but what they say remains up there and people respond to it."" He said he had come under pressure from officials to have his own departmental Twitter account when he was appointed Northern Powerhouse minister in June 2016 but he had ""just refused"". He believes other social media platforms are more ""representative"" of public opinion and therefore more useful in terms of keeping in touch with constituents and dealing with daily casework. The Commons authorities said the details of advice given to MPs about social media had to remain private.  ""The Parliamentary Health and Wellbeing Service deals with a range of enquiries from members,"" it said. ""However we cannot comment on specific advice given, which remains confidential."" Since 2014, MPs have been able to call on help with personal and professional issues including health and well-being information, financial issues, employment law, stress at home or work and relationship matters.

It was filed at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which normally rules on disputes between states.  Last year,  the UN issued a damning report  into the violence in Myanmar, saying military leaders should go on trial for genocide. Myanmar's government denies its troops carried out such crimes.  Thousands of Rohingya were killed and more than 700,000 fled to neighbouring Bangladesh during an army crackdown in the Buddhist-majority country in 2017. The UN's Independent International Fact Finding Mission on Myanmar said in August 2018 that the army's tactics were ""grossly disproportionate to actual security threats"" and that ""military necessity would never justify killing indiscriminately, gang raping women, assaulting children, and burning entire villages.""  Myanmar rejected the report. It has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats. Last year prosecutors at the International Criminal Court (ICC) - which would normally investigate allegations of war crimes as opposed to the ICJ - opened a preliminary inquiry into Myanmar's alleged crimes against its Rohingya Muslim minority. But the fact that Myanmar has not signed up to the ICC complicates the legal case there and no charges have yet been filed.  Why is Gambia making a complaint?  The Gambia filed a lawsuit to the ICJ - sometimes known as the world court - at the Hague on Monday. The country, which is majority Muslim, also has the support of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and a team of international lawyers.  Both it and Myanmar are signatories to the 1948 Genocide Convention, committing them to preventing and punishing the crime of genocide. What you need to know about the crisis How the 'genocide' was investigated Seeing through the official story in Myanmar In its filing, The Gambia asked the court to implement an injunction to make sure Myanmar immediately ""stops atrocities and genocide against its own Rohingya people"". Abubacarr M Tambadou, The Gambia's attorney general and minister of justice, has spearheaded the effort. He previously worked at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda investigating the 1994 genocide there.  image copyright Reuters image caption The move is being spearheaded by Gambia's Minister of Justice Mr Tambadou told the BBC last month that he was motivated to act after hearing stories of brutal killings, rape and torture from survivors on a visit to a Rohingya refugee camp in Bangladesh. Who are the Rohingya? The Rohingya are a Muslim ethnic minority in Myanmar who have their own language and culture. They mostly live in Rakhine state, which borders Bangladesh.  Despite living in Myanmar for generations, they are not recognised as citizens or counted in the census. Thy are often painted, including by government officials, as illegal immigrants and interlopers from Bangladesh. On 25 August 2017, Rohingya militants attacked dozens of police posts, killing several officers. Clearance operations by security forces in response saw entire villages burned, and civilians attacked, raped and killed, UN investigators found.  media caption Myanmar: No homecoming for Rohingyas Hundreds of thousands fled to Bangladesh, joining many Rohingya living in camps who had fled in earlier waves. Attempts to repatriate Rohingya have so far failed - with refugees citing the lack of accountability for atrocities committed and uncertainty over their fate on their return.  In October the UN warned that there was a ""serious risk of genocide recurring"" against those still inside the country.  Earlier this year,  the BBC found evidence that entire Rohingya villages had been demolished  and replaced by secure government facilities.  media caption Myanmar: Who are the Rohingya?

At 02:21 Eastern Standard Time on election night, President Trump walked onto a stage set up in the East Room of the White House and declared victory. ""We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election."" His speech came an hour after he'd tweeted: ""They are trying to steal the election"". He hadn't won. There was no victory to steal. But to many of his most fervent supporters, these facts didn't matter, and still don't.  Sixty five days later, a motley coalition of rioters stormed the US Capitol building. They included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, members of ""Stop the Steal"" groups, far-right activists, online trolls and others.  On Friday 8 January -  some 48 hours after the Washington riots - Twitter began a purge of some of the most influential pro-Trump accounts that had been pushing conspiracies and urging direct action to overturn the election result. Then came the big one - Mr Trump himself. The president was permanently banned from tweeting to his more than 88 million followers ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence"".  The violence in Washington shocked the world and seemed to catch the authorities off guard.  But for anyone who had been carefully watching the unfolding story - online and on the streets of American cities - it came as no surprise. The idea of a rigged election was seeded by the president in speeches and on Twitter, months before the vote.  On election day, the rumors started just as Americans were going to the polls. A video of a Republican poll watcher being denied entry to a Philadelphia polling station went viral. It was a genuine error, caused by confusion about the rules. The man was later  allowed into the station  to observe the count.   A poll watcher in Philly was just wrongfully prevented from entering the polling place #StopTheSteal   pic.twitter.com/iJTFtRk0Id — Will Chamberlain (@willchamberlain)  November 3, 2020   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter But it became the first of many videos, images, graphics and claims that went viral in the days that followed, giving rise to a hashtag: #StopTheSteal. The message behind it was clear - Mr Trump had won a landslide victory, but dark forces in the establishment ""deep state"" had stolen it from him. In the early hours of Wednesday 4 November, while votes were still being counted and three days before the US networks called the election for Joe Biden, President Trump claimed victory, alleging ""a fraud on the American public"". Mr Trump did not provide any evidence to back up his claims.  Studies carried out for previous US elections  have shown that voter fraud is extremely rare. image copyright Getty Images By mid-afternoon a Facebook group called ""Stop the Steal"" was created and quickly became one of the fastest-growing in the platform's history. By Thursday morning, it had added more than 300,000 members. Many of the posts focused on unsubstantiated allegations of mass voter fraud, including manufactured claims that thousands of dead people had voted and that voting machines had somehow been programmed to flip votes from Mr Trump to Mr Biden. 'Stop the steal': The deep roots of Trumpâs 'voter fraud' strategy US Election 2020: The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive US Election 2020: Trump claims about Dominion machines fact-checked But some of the posts were more alarming, speaking of the need for a ""civil war"" or ""revolution"". By Thursday afternoon, Facebook had taken down Stop the Steal, but not before it had generated nearly half a million comments, shares, likes, and reactions.  Dozens of other groups quickly sprang up in its place.  image copyright Getty Images The idea of a stolen election continued to spread online and take hold. Soon, a dedicated Stop the Steal website was launched in a bid to register ""boots on the ground to protect the integrity of the vote"". On Saturday 7 November, major news organisations declared that Joe Biden had won the election. In Democratic strongholds, throngs of people took to the streets to celebrate. But the reaction online from Mr Trump's most ardent supporters was one of anger and defiance. They planned a rally in Washington DC for the following Saturday, dubbed the Million MAGA (Make America Great Again) March. Trump tweeted that he might try to stop by the demonstration and ""say hello"". image copyright Getty Images Previous pro-Trump rallies in Washington had failed to attract large crowds. But thousands gathered at Freedom Plaza that sunny morning. One extremism researcher  called it  the ""debut of the pro-Trump insurgency"". As Trump's motorcade drove through the city, supporters screaming with delight rushed to catch a glimpse of the president, who beamed at them wearing a red MAGA hat. image copyright Reuters While mainstream conservative figures were present, the event was dominated by far-right groups.  Dozens of members of the far-right, anti-immigrant, all-male group Proud Boys, who have repeatedly been involved in violent street protests and were among those who would later break into the US Capitol, joined the march. Militia groups, far-right media figures and promoters of conspiracy theories were also there. Capitol riots: Who broke into the building? US Election 2020: Who are the Proud Boys - and who are antifa? As night fell, clashes between Trump supporters and counter-protesters broke out, including a brawl about five blocks from the White House.  The violence - although largely contained by police on this occasion - was a clear sign of things to come.  By now, President Trump and his legal team had invested their hopes in dozens of legal cases. Although a number of courts had already dismissed fraud allegations, many in the pro-Trump online world became fascinated with two lawyers with close ties to the president - Sidney Powell and L Lin Wood.  Ms Powell and Mr Wood promised they were preparing cases of voter fraud so comprehensive that when released, they would destroy the case for Mr Biden having won the presidency. Watch Aleem Maqbool's film America: Storming the Capitol, in which he examines the question - how safe is American democracy?  Ms Powell, 65, a conservative activist and former federal prosecutor, told Fox News that the effort would ""release the Kraken"" - a reference to a gigantic sea monster from Scandinavian folklore that rises up from the ocean to devour its enemies. The ""Kraken"" quickly became an internet meme, representing sprawling, unsubstantiated claims of widespread election fraud. Ms Powell and Mr Wood became heroes to followers of the QAnon conspiracy theory - who believe President Trump and a secret military intelligence team are battling a deep state made up of Satan-worshipping paedophiles in the Democratic Party, media, business and Hollywood. What is QAnon? What is the 'Kraken' conspiracy?  The lawyers became a conduit between the president and his most conspiracy-minded supporters - a number of whom ended up inside the Capitol on 6 January.  Ms Powell and Mr Wood were successful in whipping up sound and fury online, but their legal efforts came to nothing. When they released almost 200 pages of documents in late November, it became clear that  their lawsuit  consisted predominantly of conspiracy theories and debunked allegations that had already been rejected by dozens of courts. The filings contained simple legal errors - and basic misspellings and typos.  Still, the meme lived on. The terms ""Kraken"" and ""Release the Kraken"" were used more than a million times on Twitter before the Capitol riot. As courts rejected Mr Trump's legal cases, far-right activists increasingly targeted election workers and officials. Death threats were made against a Georgia election worker, and Republican officials in the state - including Governor Brian Kemp, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and the official in charge of the state's voting systems, Gabriel Sterling - were branded ""traitors"" online. Mr Sterling issued an emotional and prescient warning to the president in a press conference on 1 December.  media caption ""This has to stop... someone's gonna get killed"": Mr Sterling calls on President Trump to condemn the threats ""Someone's going to get hurt, someone's going to get shot, someone's going to get killed, and it's not right,"" he said.  In Michigan in early December, Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, had just finished trimming her Christmas tree with her four-year-old son when she heard a commotion outside her Detroit home.  About 30 protesters with banners stood outside, shouting ""Stop the steal!"" through megaphones.  ""Benson, you are a villain,"" one person yelled.  ""You're a threat to democracy!"" called another.  One of the demonstrators live-streamed the protest on Facebook, stating that her group was ""not going away"".  It was just one of a rash of protests targeting people involved in the vote.  In Georgia, a constant stream of Trump supporters drove past Mr Raffensperger's home, honking their horns. His wife received threats of sexual violence.  In Arizona, demonstrators gathered outside of the home of Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, at one point warning: ""We are watching you.""  On 11 December,  the Supreme Court rejected  an attempt by the state of Texas to throw out election results.  As the president's legal and political windows continued to close, the language in pro-Trump online circles became increasingly violent. On 12 December, a second Stop the Steal rally was held in the capital. Once again, thousands attended, and once again prominent far-right activists, QAnon supporters, fringe MAGA groups and militia movements were among the demonstrators.  image copyright Getty Images Michael Flynn, Mr Trump's former national security advisor, likened the protesters to the biblical soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho. This echoed the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. Nick Fuentes, the leader of Groypers, a far-right movement that targets Republican politicians and figures they deem too moderate, told the crowd: ""We are going to destroy the GOP!"" The march once again  turned violent .  Then two days later,  the Electoral College certified  Mr Biden's victory, one of the final steps required for him to take office.  On online platforms, supporters were becoming resigned to the view that all legal avenues were dead ends, and only direct action could save the Trump presidency.  Since election day, alongside Mr Flynn, Ms Powell and Mr Wood, a new figure had rapidly gained prominence among pro-Trump circles online. Ron Watkins is the son of Jim Watkins, the man behind 8chan and 8kun - message boards filled with extreme language and views, violence and extreme sexual content. They gave rise to the QAnon movement.  In a series of viral tweets on 17 December, Ron Watkins suggested President Trump should follow the example of Roman leader Julius Caesar, and capitalise on ""fierce loyalty of the military"" in order to ""restore the Republic"".  Ron Watkins encouraged his more than 500,000 followers to make #CrossTheRubicon a Twitter trend, referring to the moment when Caesar launched a civil war by crossing the Rubicon river in 49BC. The hashtag was also used by more mainstream figures - including the chairwoman of Arizona Republican Party,  Kelli Ward . In a separate tweet, Ron Watkins said Mr Trump must invoke the Insurrection Act, which empowers the president to deploy the military and federal forces. Mr Trump met Ms Powell, Mr Flynn and others at a strategy meeting at the White House the following day, 18 December.  During the meeting, according to the New York Times, Mr Flynn called on Mr Trump to  impose martial law  and deploy the military to ""rerun"" the election. The meeting further stoked online chatter about ""war"" and ""revolution"" in far-right circles. Many came to see the joint session of Congress on 6 January, normally a formality, as a last roll of the dice.  A wishful story began to take hold among QAnon and some MAGA supporters. They hoped that Vice-President Mike Pence, who was set to preside over the 6 January ceremony, would ignore the electoral college votes. The president, they said, would then deploy the military to quell any unrest, order the mass arrest of the ""deep state cabal"" who had rigged the election and send them to Guantanamo Bay military prison.   Back in the land of reality, none of this was remotely feasible. But it launched a movement for ""patriot caravans"" to organise ride shares to help transport thousands from around the country to Washington DC on 6 January. image copyright Getty Images Long processions of vehicles flying Trump flags and sometimes towing elaborately decorated trailers gathered in car parks in cities including Louisville, Kentucky, Atlanta, Georgia, and Scranton, Pennsylvania.  ""We are on our way,"" one caravaner posted on Twitter with a picture of about two dozen supporters. At an Ikea parking lot in North Carolina, another man showed off his truck. ""The flags are a little tattered - we'll call them battle flags now,"" he said. As it became clear that Mr Pence and other key Republicans would follow the law and allow Congress to certify Mr Biden's win, the language towards them became vicious. ""Pence will be in jail awaiting trial for treason,"" Mr Wood tweeted. ""He will face execution by firing squad."" Online discussion reached boiling point. References to firearms, war and violence were rife on self-styled ""free speech""  social platforms  such as Gab and Parler, which are popular with Trump supporters, as well as on other sites. In Proud Boys groups, where members had once supported police, some turned against authorities, whom they deemed to no longer be on their side.  Hundreds of posts on a popular pro-Trump site, TheDonald, openly discussed plans to cross barricades, carry firearms and other weapons to the march in defiance of Washington's strict gun laws. There was open chatter about storming the Capitol and arresting ""treasonous"" members of Congress. On Wednesday 6 January, Mr Trump addressed a crowd of thousands at the Ellipse, a park just south of the White House, for more than an hour. Early on he encouraged supporters to ""peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard"", but he ended with a warning. ""We fight like hell, and if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore. ""So we're going to, we're going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenueâ¦ and we're going to the Capitol."" image copyright Rex Features To some observers, the potential for violence that day was clear from the outset.  Michael Chertoff, former secretary of homeland security under President George W Bush, blamed the Capitol Police, who reportedly turned down offers of assistance from the much larger National Guard ahead of time. He characterised it as ""the worst failure of a police force I can think of"". ""I think it was a very foreseeable potential negative turn of events,"" Mr Chertoff said.  media caption Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol ""To be blunt, it was obvious. If you read the newspaper and were awake, you understood that you've got a lot of people who have been convinced there was a fraudulent election. Some of them are extremists, and violent. Some of the groups openly said, 'Bring your guns'."" Still, many Americans were astonished by Wednesday's scenes, like James Clark, a 68-year-old Republican from Virginia. ""I find it absolutely shocking. I didn't think it would come to this,""  he told  the BBC. But the signs were there for weeks. A hodgepodge of extreme and conspiratorial groups were convinced that the election was stolen. Online, they repeatedly talked about arming themselves, and violence.  Perhaps the authorities didn't think their posts were serious, or specific enough to investigate. They now face pointed questions. For Joe Biden's inauguration on 20 January, Mr Chertoff is expecting a ""much stronger showing"" by security services than last Wednesday night.  But that hasn't stopped many on extreme platforms calling for further violence and disruption on the day.  There are questions, too, for the major social media platforms, which enabled conspiracy theories to reach millions of people. Late on Friday, Twitter deleted the accounts of Mr Flynn, the former Trump advisor, the ""Kraken"" lawyers Ms Powell and Mr Wood, and Mr Watkins. Then Mr Trump himself.  Twitter permanently suspends Trump's account Arrests of those who stormed the Capitol continue. But most of the rioters still live in a parallel online universe - a subterranean world filled with alternative facts.  They have already come up with fanciful explanations to dismiss Mr Trump's  video statement , posted on Twitter the day after the riots, in which he acknowledged for the first time that ""a new administration will be inaugurated on 20 January"". He can't possibly be giving up, they contend. Among their new theories - it's not really him in the video but a computer-generated ""deep fake"". Or perhaps the president is being held hostage.  Many still believe Mr Trump will prevail. There's no evidence behind any of this, but it does prove one thing.  No matter what happens to Donald Trump, the rioters who stormed the US Capitol are not backing down anytime soon.

US officials can authorise the killing of Americans abroad if they are leaders of al-Qaeda or its allies, according to the  document  obtained by NBC News.  Lethal force is lawful if they are judged to pose an ""imminent threat"" and their capture is not feasible, it adds.  US drone strikes against militant suspects in countries such as Yemen and Pakistan are deeply controversial.  Under President Barack Obama the US has expanded its use of drones to kill hundreds of al-Qaeda suspects, arguing that it is acting in self-defence in accordance with international law. Critics argue the drone strikes amount to execution without trial and cause many civilian casualties.  Legal framework The undated 16-page Department of Justice white paper published by NBC gives more details of the justification for the use of drones outside recognised war zones. media caption BBC's Orla Guerin: ""The study says that drones are damaging and counterproductive to US security interests"" It says sovereignty is not deemed to have been violated if the host nation gives its consent, or is unwilling or unable to suppress the threat posed by the individual targeted. It also sets out a ""legal framework"" for the use of lethal force against US citizens in foreign countries.  It concludes that such killings do not violate the US Constitution as long as: An informed, high-level official of the US government has determined that the targeted individual poses an imminent threat of violent attack against the US Capture is infeasible and the US continues to monitor whether capture becomes feasible The operation would be conducted in a manner consistent with applicable law of war principles  The paper adopts a broad definition of ""imminent threat"", saying it is not necessary to produce evidence that a specific attack is being planned if the target is generally engaged in plotting against the US.  'Remarkable document' It also asserts that courts should not play a role in reviewing or controlling such decisions.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) said the white paper was a ""pretty remarkable document"". image caption Anwar al-Awlaki was among three Americans killed in drone strikes in Yemen in 2011 Jameel Jaffer, deputy legal director of the ACLU,  said in a blog post  the paper revealed ""both the recklessness of the government's central claim and the deficiencies in the government's defense"" of its drone strike policy. ""This sweeping authority is said to exist even if the threat presented isn't imminent in any ordinary sense of that word, even if the target has never been charged with a crime or informed of the allegations against him, and even if the target is not located anywhere near an actual battlefield,"" Mr Jaffer added. The ACLU has helped the relatives of three Americans who died in drone strikes sue the Pentagon and CIA. Their lawsuit claims the deaths were unconstitutional. Anwar al-Awlaki, an al-Qaeda suspect born in the US state of New Mexico, was killed by an unmanned plane in September 2011.  Samir Khan, a naturalised US citizen who produced an online magazine promoting al-Qaeda's ideology, died in the same missile strike.  Awlaki's 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman, who was born in Colorado, was killed a month later. The Obama administration has been under growing pressure from politicians in Congress to share more details of its drone strike programme, including secret legal documents.  Last month the UN launched an inquiry into the impact of drone strikes on civilians.

Published 12 April 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing media caption What exactly is an executive order, and how significant are they to a president's legacy? One of the first ways a new president is able to exercise political power is through unilateral executive orders.  While legislative efforts take time, a swipe of the pen from the White House can often enact broad changes in government policy and practice.  President Donald Trump has wasted little time in taking advantage of this privilege.  Given his predecessor's reliance on executive orders to circumvent Congress in the later days of his presidency, he has a broad range of areas in which to flex his muscle.  What are executive orders? Here's a look at some of what Mr Trump has done so far: Climate change policy reversal Mr Trump signed the order at the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) undoing a key part of the Obama administration's efforts to tackle global warming. The order reverses the Clean Power Plan, which had required states to regulate power plants, but had been on hold while being challenged in court. Before signing the order, a White House official told the press that Mr Trump does believe in human-caused climate change, but that the order was necessary to ensure American energy independence and jobs. Environmental groups warn that undoing those regulations will have serious consequences at home and abroad. ""I think it is a climate destruction plan in place of a climate action plan,"" the Natural Resources Defense Council's David Doniger told the BBC, adding that they will fight the president in court.  Immediate impact : A coalition of 17 states filed a legal challenge against the Trump administration's decision to roll back climate change regulations. The challenge, led by New York state, argued that the administration has a legal obligation to regulate emissions of the gases believed to cause global climate change. Mars Inc, Staples and The Gap are among US corporations who are also challenging Mr Trump's reversal on climate change policy.  Travel ban 2.0 After an angry weekend in Florida in which he accused former-president Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones at Trump Tower, Mr Trump returned to the White House to sign a revised version of his controversial travel ban.  The executive order titled ""protecting the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States"" was signed out of the view of the White House press corps on 6 March. The order's new language is intended to skirt the legal pitfalls that caused his first travel ban to be halted by the court system.   The updated ban: Temporarily halts entry to citizens for 90-days of six Muslim-majority countries (Iran, Libya, Syria, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen)  Removes Iraq from the previous list, due to increased vetting of its own citizens Delays implementation until 16 March Allows current visa holders to travel to the US Does not affect permanent visa holders (Green Card holders)  Suspends the refugee programme for 120 days Treats Syrians like any other refugee or immigrant Removes the religious clause favouring religious minorities - namely Christians Immediate impact : Soon after the order was signed, it was once again blocked by a federal judge, this time in Hawaii.  Trump signs new travel-ban directive Undoing Obama-era waterway regulations Surrounded by farmers and Republican lawmakers, Mr Trump signed an order on 28 February directing the EPA and the Army Corp of Engineers to reconsider a rule issued by President Obama. The 2015 regulation - known as the Waters of the United States rule - gave authority to the federal government over small waterways, including wetlands, headwaters and small ponds. The rule required Clean Water Act permits for any developer that wished to alter or damage these relatively small water resources, which the president described as ""puddles"" in his signing remarks.  Opponents of Mr Obama's rule, including industry leaders, condemned it as a massive power grab by Washington. Scott Pruitt, Mr Trump's pick to lead the EPA, will now begin the task of rewriting the rule, and a new draft is not expected for several years.  Immediate impact : The EPA has been ordered to rewrite, or even repeal the rule, but first it must be reviewed. Water protection laws were passed by Congress long before Mr Obama's rule was announced, so it cannot simply be undone with the stroke of a pen. Instead the EPA must re-evaluate how to interpret the 1972 Clean Water Act. Coal waste A bill the president signed on 16 February put an end to an Obama-era regulation that aimed at protecting waterways from coal mining waste. Senator Mitch McConnell had called the rule an ""attack on coal miners"".  The US Interior Department, which reportedly spent years drawing up the regulation before it was issued in December, had said it would protect 6,000 miles of streams and 52,000 acres of forests. Business regulations An attempt to cut down on the burden of small businesses.  Described as a ""two-out, one-in"" approach, the order asked government departments that request a new regulation to specify two other regulations they will drop. The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) will manage the regulations and is expected to be led by the Republican Mick Mulvaney. Some categories of regulation will be exempt from the ""two-out, one-in"" clause - such as those dealing with the military and national security and ""any other category of regulations exempted by the Director"". Immediate impact:  Wait and see. Trump moves to cut business regulation Travel ban (first version) Probably his most controversial action, so far, taken to keep the country safe from terrorists, the president said. It included: suspension of refugee programme for 120 days, and cap on 2017 numbers indefinite ban on Syrian refugees ban on anyone arriving from seven Muslim-majority countries, with certain exceptions cap of 50,000 refugees The effect was felt at airports in the US and around the world as people were stopped boarding US-bound flights or held when they landed in the US.   Immediate impact:  Enacted pretty much straight away. But there are battles ahead. Federal judges brought a halt to deportations, and legal rulings appear to have put an end to the travel ban - much to the president's displeasure.  Trump border policy: Who's affected? Border security image copyright Getty Images image caption A fence is already in place along much of the US-Mexico border On Mr Trump's first day as a presidential candidate in June 2015, he made securing the border with Mexico a priority. He pledged repeatedly at rallies to ""build the wall"" along the southern border, saying it would be ""big, beautiful, and powerful"".  Now he has signed a pair of executive orders designed to fulfil that campaign promise.  One order declares that the US will create ""a contiguous, physical wall or other similarly secure, contiguous, and impassable physical barrier"". The second order pledges to hire 10,000 more immigration officers, and to revoke federal grant money from so-called ""sanctuary cities"" which refuse to deport undocumented immigrants. It remains to be seen how Mr Trump will pay for the wall, although he has repeatedly insisted that it will be fully paid for by the Mexican government, despite their leaders saying otherwise.  Immediate impact:  The Department of Homeland Security has a ""small"" amount of money available (about $100m) to use immediately, but that won't get them very far. Construction of the wall will cost billions of dollars - money that Congress will need to approve. Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said the Republican-led Congress will need to come up with $12-$15bn more, and the funding fight - and any construction - will come up against issues with harsh terrain, private land owners and opposition from both Democrats and some Republicans.  The department will also need additional funds from Congress to hire more immigration officers, but the order will direct the head of the agency to start changing deportation priorities. Cities targeted by the threat to remove federal grants will likely build legal challenges, but without a court injunction, the money can be removed. The Center for Biological Diversity, an environmental group, along with Arizona Democrat Raul Graijalva, have filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration.  They argue the Department of Homeland Security is required to draft a new environmental review of the impacts of the wall and other border enforcement activities as it could damage public lands.  How exactly will Trump 'build the wall'? Two orders, two pipelines image copyright Getty Images image caption With the stroke of a pen... On his second full working day, the president signed two orders to advance construction of two controversial pipelines - the Keystone XL and Dakota Access. Mr Trump told reporters the terms of both deals would be renegotiated, and using American steel was a requirement. Keystone, a 1,179-mile (1,897km) pipeline running from Canada to US refineries in the Gulf Coast, was halted by President Barack Obama in 2015 due to concerns over the message it would send about climate change. The second pipeline was halted last year as the Army looked at other routes, amid huge protests by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe at a North Dakota site.  Immediate impact:  Mr Trump has granted a permit to TransCanada, the Keystone XL builder, to move forward with the controversial pipeline. As a result, TransCanada will drop an arbitration claim for $15bn in damages it filed under the North American Free Trade Agreement. Mr Trump made no mention of an American steel requirement. Construction will not start until the company obtains a permit from Nebraska's Public Service Commission. The Dakota Access pipeline has since been filled with oil and the company is in the process of preparing to begin moving oil.  Keystone XL pipeline: Why is it so disputed? Dakota Pipeline: What's behind the controversy? Instructing federal agencies to weaken Obamacare In one of his first actions as president, Mr Trump issued a multi-paragraph directive to the Department of Health and Human Services and other federal agencies involved in managing the nation's healthcare system. The order states that agencies must ""waive, defer, grant exemptions from, or delay"" any portions of the Affordable Care Act that creates financial burden on states, individuals or healthcare providers.  Although the order technically does not authorise any powers the executive agencies do not already have, it's viewed as a clear signal that the Trump administration will be rolling back Obama-era healthcare regulations wherever possible. Immediate impact : Republicans failed to secure an overhaul of the US healthcare system due to a lack of support for the legislation. That means Mr Trump's executive order is one of the only remaining efforts to undermine Obamacare.  Can Obamacare be repealed? Re-instating a ban on international abortion counselling image copyright Reuters image caption Abortion activists were among the many protesters that came out against Trump's presidency one day after his inauguration What's called the Mexico City policy, first implemented in 1984 under Republican President Ronald Reagan, prevents foreign non-governmental organisations that receive any US cash from ""providing counselling or referrals for abortion or advocating for access to abortion services in their country"", even if they do so with other funding. The ban, derided as a ""global gag rule"" by its critics, has been the subject of a political tug-of-war ever since its inception, with every Democratic president rescinding the measure, and every Republican bringing it back.  Anti-abortion activists expected Mr Trump to act quickly on this - and he didn't disappoint them. Immediate impact:  The policy will come into force as soon as the Secretaries of State and Heath write an implementation plan and apply to both renewals and new grants. The US State Department has notified the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that US funding for United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) would be withdrawn, arguing that it supports coercive abortion or involuntary sterilisation. The agency has denied this, pointing to examples of its life-saving work in more than 150 countries and territories.  This policy will be much broader than the last time the rule was in place - the Guttmacher Institute, Kaiser Family Foundation and Population Action International believe the order, as written, will apply to all global health funding by the US, instead of only reproductive health or family planning. Trump's order on abortion policy: What does it mean? Withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership image copyright Getty Images image caption The TPP pact would have affected 40% of global trade. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, once viewed as the crown jewel of Barack Obama's international trade policy, was a regular punching bag for Mr Trump on the campaign trail (although he at times  seemed uncertain  about what nations were actually involved). The deal was never approved by Congress so it had yet to go into effect in the US. Therefore the formal ""withdrawal"" is more akin to a decision on the part of the US to end ongoing international negotiations and let the deal wither and die.  Immediate impact : Takes effect immediately. In the meantime, some experts are worried China will seek to replace itself in the deal or add TPP nations to its own free trade negotiations, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), excluding the US.

Kenneth McKenna targeted the girls and made threats to try and prevent them revealing the abuse he had inflicted on them. A jury at the High Court in Edinburgh found McKenna, of Bannockburn, guilty of abusing the girls from the ages of 11 and 12. The 57-year-old was also placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely. The jury unanimously found McKenna guilty of five charges of indecency, indecent assault, attempted rape and rape. He was acquitted of a further charge of rape against a third girl. One of the victims told the trial that she had never confronted McKenna directly, but eventually reported the abuse to police.  She said: ""It's like 30 odd years and I kind of buried it in a closet way, way back."" Defence solicitor advocate George Pollock told the court: ""Clearly the offences are serious and there is nothing I can say to mitigate the offences.""

""I've seen it first hand at work."" A party that delivers By Adam Easton, BBC News, Warsaw Law and Justice seems to have won the highest percentage of votes since democracy was restored here in 1989.  The party will have a slightly increased majority and a strong mandate to continue its socially conservative programme.  Law and Justice has pledged to continue its controversial reform of the judiciary despite opposition from the European Commission, which says the independence of Poland's judges is being eroded. That issue has not dented Law and Justice's popularity. Instead the party has reaped the rewards of its generous welfare scheme, which has benefitted millions of families. For the first time in years, it has proposed a balanced budget for next year despite economists' warnings that the scheme would ruin public finances.  Law and Justice now has a reputation of a party that delivers on its promises. Results from 99% of constituencies published on Monday suggest an increase for PiS on the 231 MPs they currently hold in the 460-seat lower house to 239.  The state electoral commission will announce the breakdown of parliamentary seats with the final official result, which is expected later on Monday.

But his fairy tale journey, from humble beginnings to stardom, ended on 14 June when he was found dead in his flat at the age of 34. The police in Mumbai, where he lived, said he took his own life.  The news devastated millions of his fans, who saw his success as their own. Sushant grew up in Bihar, one of India's poorest states. He worked hard and was admitted to one of India's top engineering colleges - a sure way of securing a bright future for middle class families. But his heart was set on acting. So he dropped out of college and went to Mumbai, a city that makes and breaks thousands of dreams every day. He did small roles, took up odd jobs and worked in theatre for years until one of his TV shows became a hit. Success on the big screen followed soon. image copyright Getty Images image caption He was an excellent dancer and often performed on stage His story fired the ambitions of young people in small towns - it's why many of his fans took his death as a personal loss. And just as they were coming to terms with the news, unverified details about Sushant's career, financial status, relationships and even mental health started circulating on social media and in debates on news channels.  No-one has been spared by the voyeuristic coverage - his therapist, his former cook, his friends, his manager, his family, his colleagues have all been hounded for interviews and exclusives.  With police drip-feeding details to the media, the mystery around his death has only deepened. Outsiders v insiders Days after he died, some social media users claimed that he killed himself because a few powerful Bollywood families and directors had treated him unfairly. They said he was an outsider who had no ""godfather"" in the industry, and that his rise was unacceptable to certain Bollywood dynasties. They pointed to recent reports of him being side-lined after he was promised roles in big-budget films.  image copyright Getty Images image caption One of his hit films was a biopic of cricket legend MS Dhoni (left) The Mumbai police is still investigating what led to the actor's death. They have interviewed more than 50 people from the film industry to find out if there is enough evidence to file abetment of suicide charges. The officers are yet to file a final report. The allegations led to a severe backlash on social media against some directors and producers. Karan Johar, who has launched the careers of the children of former film stars, was especially targeted.  He faced abuse and threats online, but did not respond to any of it. The police have not interviewed him. A film critic, who does not want to be identified, says Sushant's death has definitely brought a harsh truth to the fore: Bollywood doesn't welcome people who don't have the right connections. ""But we don't know if professional rivalry pushed Sushant to the brink. We need to wait for the investigation to finish,"" he said. image copyright Getty Images image caption Director Sanjay Leela Bhansali was among those questioned by the police While this debate raged, some channels turned their focus on Rhea Chakraborty, Sushant's actress girlfriend. Sushant's father had filed a police complaint against Rhea in Bihar state, where he lives. He accused her of abetment of suicide and misappropriation of Sushant's money. The media quickly jumped on this new twist in the case.  On social media, she has been called a ""gold digger"" who ""took away Sushant's money"".  Rhea has denied any wrongdoing and issued a desperate plea to Home Minister Amit Shah for a fair investigation into Sushant's death.  Respected   @AmitShah  sir  ,  Iâm sushants Singh Rajputs girlfriend Rhea chakraborty,it is now over a month since his sudden demise   I have complete faith in the government, however in the interest of justice , I request you with folded hands to initiate a CBI enquiry..part 1 .. — Rhea Chakraborty (@Tweet2Rhea)  July 16, 2020   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter She has since been questioned by various investigative agencies.  Voyeuristic coverage TV news channels and websites seem to favour two theories about what led to Sushant's death.  Some of them believe he was pushed to the brink because of Rhea and the apathy of movie directors, while others insist that his death is suspicious. And to prove their respective theories, they have crossed several red lines, says mental health expert, Dr Soumitra Pathare. The actor's bank account details have been leaked, and information about his mental health and medication have also been reported.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Sushant was 34 when he died Dr Pathare says every news organisation should have a code of ethics when it comes to reporting on a sensitive subject such as suicide. ""But sadly, not many channels follow ethics in our ratings-driven market. Everyone wants to outdo each other and they forget their responsibility,"" he adds. Sushant's social media handles were followed by millions of young people who are now reading and watching every new rumour and development related to his death. It should make media houses more responsible, says Dr Pathare, adding that some of those young people could be in a mentally vulnerable situation. He also blames some media houses' limited understanding of mental health issues.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Congress party leaders in Bihar have demanded a federal probe Mental health is a largely unaddressed issue in India and one that, ironically, has been wrongly portrayed by Bollywood for years. ""Our films mostly portray a depressed person as crazy or as somebody who is always sad,"" Dr Pathare says. A TV channel recently broadcast an ""exclusive video"" that showed Sushant relaxing at his home a few months before his death. The channel declared that the actor looked happy in the video and offered it as clinching evidence that he was not fighting depression. Dr Pathare says this shows the channel's narrow understanding of the subject. ""It's a myth that a depressed person is always sulking,"" he adds. The Mumbai police have also been criticised for releasing details such as what the actor was searching for on the internet a few hours before his death. image copyright Hindustan Times image caption The actor often spoke about struggles of making it in Bollywood without any connections Vikram Singh, a former top cop in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, says the police should not be releasing such sensitive information. ""How it helps the investigation is beyond my understanding. The risk is that many young people may try to search for similar things and it could lead them into a dark place,"" he adds. Politics and a turf war Elections are due to be held later in the year in Bihar - the actor's home state. So it's not surprising that politicians want to be seen fighting to get justice for Sushant's family. Bihar's Chief Minister, Nitish Kumar, has recommended that the case be investigated by the federal investigative agency, the CBI  or Central Bureau of Investigation. The federal government, run by Mr Kumar's coalition partner, the Bharatiya Janata Party, has accepted the recommendation and the CBI has begun its probe. It's unclear how this will impact the ongoing investigation by the Mumbai police, which comes under the Maharashtra state government, headed by the Shiv Sena - a former ally of the BJP. image copyright Getty Images image caption Bihar police officers are trying to investigate the case in Mumbai But for the past few weeks, Bihar and Mumbai police have been engaged in what Mr Singh describes as a ""turf war"". A Bihar police officer who travelled to Mumbai to investigate the case has been quarantined for allegedly breaking Covid-19 restrictions.  ""Such public display of turf war has been really ugly. For god's sake, a family has lost their son and you need to show some sensitivity,"" Mr Singh says, adding that all investigative agencies need to work together to get justice for Sushant's family. ""Closure is very important for them and also for his fans. But this media circus and politics are not helping.""

For years he was the right-hand man, the gatekeeper, to Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was widely credited with defeating the al-Qaeda insurgency in the 2000s. He was also the linchpin in all Saudi Arabia's relations with the ""Five Eyes"" (US, UK, Canada, Australia, New Zealand) intelligence agencies. In 2010 this crucial link ""helped save hundreds of lives"", according to a former Western intelligence officer who worked with him. Al-Qaeda in Yemen had smuggled a powerful bomb on-board a cargo plane bound for Chicago, hidden inside a printer ink toner cartridge. But Saudi intelligence had a human informant inside al-Qaida who provided the tip-off to MI6, even relaying the serial number of the device it was hidden in. British counter-terrorism police then located and defused the bomb inside the plane at East Midlands Airport. ""If that had gone off as planned over Chicago hundreds would have been killed,"" said the former intelligence officer.  ""Dr al-Jabri transformed Saudi counter-terrorism efforts,"" says another former western intelligence official.  ""He changed it from being a crude, violent, confession-based system into one that used modern forensics and computer-based data mining.  ""He was the smartest guy we dealt with amongst so many others who were dysfunctional,"" he says. image copyright Bandar al-Galoud image caption Saad al-Jabri (circled) was welcomed by then UK Home Secretary Theresa May (right) during a visit to London in 2015 A quiet-spoken man with a doctorate in artificial intelligence from Edinburgh University, Dr al-Jabri rose to the rank of cabinet minister and held a major-general's rank in the interior ministry. But in 2015 everything changed. King Abdullah died and his half-brother Salman ascended to the throne, appointing his young and untested son Mohammed Bin Salman (known as MBS) as defence minister. MBS then ordered his country's forces to  intervene in Yemen's civil war , a move opposed by Dr al-Jabri who pointed out that there was no exit strategy. More than five years later Saudi Arabia is still looking for a way out of the costly stalemate in Yemen. In 2017 MBS carried out a  bloodless palace coup with his father's blessing . He effectively usurped the next in line to the throne, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, becoming crown prince himself. image copyright Al-Jabri family image caption Sarah al-Jabri is also being held incommunicado Today that deposed prince is under arrest, his assets seized and those who worked for him have been removed from their posts. Dr al-Jabri fled into exile in Canada. But former Western intelligence officials believe MBS still sees him as a threat to his legitimacy. ""He can't afford to have that guy as a free radical and a galvanising force against him,"" says one of them.  His family say they have tried in vain to meet the Saudi authorities ""on neutral ground"" and have now decided to go public. ""There are signs that Dr Saad is being targeted with a wide range of threats and the (Canadian) authorities are taking it seriously,"" says his son Khalid. ""We were pushed into this,"" he adds. ""We are patriots, we love our country, we don't want to embarrass Saudi Arabia but kidnapping Omar and Sarah like this, it's daylight thuggery by a state.""

The Sun  describes the Metropolitan Police's inability to clear the demonstrators as a ""national embarrassment"". Following the protesters' threat to target Heathrow airport, it says it would not be surprised if the police invited them on to the runway for a picnic. Despite hundreds of arrests,  the Times  says lawyers for the protesters believe fewer than 10% have been charged. One firm of solicitors tells the paper: ""The police give the appearance of being uncoordinated, inconsistent and disproportionate.""  The Daily Mail  carries a picture of the actress Dame Emma Thompson raising a clenched fist at one of the protests in London. It claims she had flown a ""gas-guzzling 5,400 miles to join the demo"" from Los Angeles.  image caption Demonstrators have been holding intermittent blockages on Vauxhall Bridge Papers on both sides of the Atlantic pore over Robert Mueller's report on alleged collusion between Donald Trump's campaign and Russia during the US presidential election. Far from being the ""complete exoneration"" claimed by Mr Trump,  the New York Times  believes the findings are devastating for the president because they lay out everything Congress needs to investigate him for obstruction of justice.  The Washington Post  agrees the report provides a devastating portrait of Mr Trump's behaviour that may invite the beginning of an impeachment inquiry. In the UK,  he Guardian  too suggests Mr Mueller has left open the possibility of Mr Trump being liable for prosecution. But  the New York Post  offer a different perspective. It accuses the special counsel of ""dropping the ball"" on the obstruction claim and argues that if he thought a crime had been committed, he should have had the courage of his convictions and recommended charging the president. The Daily Telegraph  also believes that with Mr Trump so comprehensively cleared on the issue of conspiring with Russia, impeachment has dropped off the political agenda. image copyright Getty/Drew Angerer The Daily Express  has details of what it calls an ""NHS battle plan to save millions of lives"".

The threats came on the eve of an anti-government march on the Royal Court.   Protesters say the march was halted by what they called stone-throwing thugs, while security forces and police looked on. The threats were allegedly made against Mohammed al-Maskati and Naji Fateel of the Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights, and Abdulhadi al-Khawaja, of Human Rights Defenders.  Anonymous groups published full personal identification details including their names, phone numbers, home and work addresses, car registration and ID numbers along with their photos on Facebook and other social networking sites.  ""These are the instigators of disorder who have organised the movements of sabotage. The heads of agitation and disorder in our beloved Bahrain need to be killed and liquidated,"" one of the threats read. Anonymous phone calls Protesters calling for democracy and demanding that the Sunni ruling family, the al-Khalifas, step down  are being accused of fomenting sectarianism.   One activist, a Sunni, told me: ""The al-Khalifas are not protecting the country, only themselves. They are criminals. They should go."" Mr al-Maskati said that he has been receiving threatening messages from anonymous phone callers  since his name and phone number were published on 10 March. I asked Abdulhadi al-Khawaja if the government had responded to the threats in any way, or offered protection to the three men. ""It is the government who is behind this,"" he said, laughing wryly. A spokesperson for the government denied the allegation.  ""The government condemns and deplores all violent threats made towards any individual and will be investigating the matter accordingly,"" the spokesperson said. 'Playing for time' However, the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said it is worried by these reports.  ""[OHCHR] is extremely concerned about these threats, which clearly constitute incitement, and calls upon the authorities to ensure effective protection for the three named individuals,"" said Robert Colville.  Others - including a journalist who did not want to be named - said they have received similar threats via text message. The journalist was accused of being a traitor and told he would be hit with a shotgun blast.  These threats are happening against a backdrop of what is widely seen as government-promoted allegations in the official media that the protesters, mainly Shia, are operating at the behest of ""foreign powers"" - understood to be shorthand for Iran. ""This government wants to divide society,"" one activist said. ""They don't want dialogue. They are playing for time and hoping the world ignores what is going on here.""

The deaths in Qasem Soleimani's hometown of Kerman led to the ceremony being delayed. The burial is the last in a series of funeral events that have brought millions on to the streets in Iran. Soleimani's killing has raised fears of a conflict between the US and Iran. The head of the Quds force was tasked with defending and projecting Iranian interests abroad, and was hailed as a hero by many in his home country. Immediately after his death, Iran threatened retaliation. How did US-Iranian ties get here? A basic guide Does this mean war? Your questions answered and more  What does international law say about the assassination? Voices from Iran: 'Soleimani did not deserve such a fate' To the US, Soleimani was a terrorist, and in explaining why he ordered the strike, President Donald Trump said he was acting on an ""imminent"" threat. What happened in Kerman? The crush in the south-eastern Iranian city happened at the start of a funeral procession that had drawn vast numbers of people on Tuesday morning, ahead of the planned burial. Eyewitnesses told BBC Persian the streets were not wide enough to hold the number of people and, with other roads closed off, there was nowhere to escape to. A coroner quoted on Iran's Isna news agency put the death toll at 50, with those injured numbering more than 200. Video online showed people on the ground, their faces covered by clothing. media caption Qasem Soleimani: Who was Iran's 'rock star' general? Iranian media later reported that the burial had resumed. Video footage showed the procession of Soleimani's casket. People threw items of clothing which officials touched against the casket before returning them. Top Iranian officials renewed their threats of revenge. ""The martyr Qasem Soleimani is more powerful... now that he is dead,"" the Revolutionary Guards' top general, Maj Gen Hossein Salami, told crowds in Kerman. The Guards were set up to defend Iran's Islamic system and are a major political and military force. The Quds Force is its overseas operations arm.  Mourners in Kerman chanted ""death to America"" and ""death to Trump"", reporters there said.  In other developments: In Iraq, thousands took to the streets in the southern city of Basra for the funeral procession of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, head of the Kataib Hezbollah militia group who was killed alongside Soleimani. Muhandis was the Iranian's top adviser and ally in Iraq, and a powerful leader among Iraq's Shia militias The US reportedly denied a visa for Iran's Foreign Minister Javad Zarif to visit the UN in New York this week, a move that appears to breach an agreement guaranteeing foreign officials access to UN headquarters The US has denied it is pulling out of Iraq, after a letter from  a US general suggested there would be a withdrawal  Iranian parliamentarians have approved a motion designating the US Army and the Pentagon as terrorist organisations, and allocated extra funds for the force once headed by Soleimani A show of unity? Analysis by Kasra Naji, BBC Persian Only seven weeks ago, Iran witnessed the biggest and most violent anti-government demonstrations in decades. Security forces killed anywhere between 330 and 1,500 protesters in more than 100 cities across the country. Thousands more were injured and arrested. So why have so many people come out to pay homage to Soleimani, in spite of widespread discontent? There is no doubt that feelings are running high. Arguably the most important man in the country's armed forces has been assassinated by the US, which for many is the arch-enemy of Iran. But it is also clear that the government launched a massive effort to mobilise as many people as possible. A huge turnout sends a strong signal to Donald Trump that the government enjoys widespread support. It sends the message that a war with Iran would rally Iranians behind their leaders in the event of foreign aggression, and that any war could well be long and costly. Read Kasra's analysis in full What are the latest US-Iran exchanges? In an interview, Foreign Minister Zarif called Soleimani's killing an ""act of war"" and said Iran's response would be against ""legitimate targets"". media caption Iran's foreign minister says the US has not pursued de-escalation since killing Soleimani Mr Zarif said President Trump had been ""misled"" by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. ""[Pompeo] believes people were dancing in the streets of Tehran and Baghdad... Now I think that he has seen the sea of humanity in Iraq and Iran yesterday. Doesn't he want to admit that he's been misdirecting American foreign policy?"" Mr Zarif asked. The new man leading Iran's elite military force Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried?

Mr Pompeo denied he and other top officials had contradicted Mr Trump on the issue and said it was Iran's leaders who had damaged Persian culture.

If you want to understand the dynamics of this election look away from the flutter of posters, from the noisy campaign trucks and their jaunty songs, and from a bewildering selection of smiling candidates contesting thousands of elected posts. Look instead at the creaking infrastructure of Manila, the visible slums, the denuded mountainsides and scrappy farms. The Philippines stands out - in a region that was once a byword for crippling poverty - for its failure to match its neighbours' partial success in reducing inequality.  Official statistics show that poverty has stayed at more or less the same level for the past decade, despite economic growth averaging 6%. media caption Karishma Vaswani meets three women whose lives reflect the economic changes of the Philippines. Ask a motor tricycle driver or a day labourer how much the past four elections have changed their lives, and they will nearly all tell you: not one bit. If you look at how they live, you can believe them. On paper, outgoing President Benigno Aquino has performed well - better, certainly, than his two predecessors. Foreign direct investment has quadrupled, and the budget deficit has fallen. Spending has increased on infrastructure, schools and rural development. Middle-class Filipinos who have good jobs or businesses feel better off. image copyright EPA image caption As well as the president and vice-presidential, 12 senators and thousands of local officials are also up for election The problem is that President Aquino started with the Philippines far behind its neighbours, and the changes he has brought are incremental, rather than revolutionary. Had the constitution allowed it, he might have been able to turn his modest successes into a story alluring enough to win another term of office. But in a reaction against the monopolisation of power by Marcos in the 1970s and 80s, Mr Aquino's mother, Corazon - who led the movement that overthrew Marcos - also oversaw a new constitution which limited presidents to a single term. So every six years there is an entirely new slate of contestants. Except they are not really new.  The people go to the polls image copyright Reuters Voters hope for jobs at home and abroad Who will lead the Philippines? A beginner's guide to the Philippine elections The fizzy drink and bun presidential poll Filipino boxing youth and politician Pacquiao An anti-establishment backlash Mar Roxas, an ally of President Aquino's, is a former minister, a vice-presidential candidate in the last 2010 election, and also the grandson of a former president. By all accounts a decent and capable politician, he is nonetheless a quintessential establishment figure.  image copyright EPA image caption The Church is still an important influence - here Mr Roxas and Mr Binay pray in Manila Cathedral - but less so than it was Another candidate, Jejomar Binay, is the outgoing vice-president, and is a wealthy former mayor of Manila's financial district, Makati. Miriam Defensor Santiago ran for president as long ago as 1992, and has also been a tough-minded judge and senator. The only political novice in this contest is Grace Poe, a first-term senator who is best known for being the adopted daughter of popular actor Fernando Poe.   image copyright Reuters image caption Grace Poe, despite a reformist stance, has been hurt by ties to oligarchs Rodrigo Duterte is not new to politics either. But as the long-serving mayor of the southern city of Davao, he is an outsider in the cosy world of  Manila political families . And his campaign style and language are certainly something very new. Mr Duterte has scarcely been able to make a campaign speech without threatening to kill someone. In fact he says openly that you need to be willing to kill to be president. He has talked about filling Manila Bay with the 100,000 criminals he says he will kill if he wins the top job, which opinion polls suggest is likely. media caption Rico Hizon on the Philippine general election His blunt, often offensive comments have won him legions of fans here. Perhaps they don't take his threats seriously. Perhaps they love the idea of a lone vigilante gun-slinging his way to justice as seen in the barilan shootout dramas that play all day on Filipino televisions. image copyright AFP image caption Not a natural diplomat, Mr Duterte has already had spats with Australia, the US and Singapore Mr Duterte's showcase is the city he has run for the best part of 30 years. Davao is the third largest city in the country, and, up until the late 1980s it also had one of the highest homicide rates in the world, thanks in large part to the conflict with the communist New People's Army. The local authorities began arming civilian militias to tackle to communist insurgents, and those militias morphed into shadowy death squads which targeted anyone seen as a threat to public order. Today, Davao is safe and law-abiding, with a prosperous business district and healthy crime statistics. image copyright AP image caption Mr Duterte's jokes about rape and murder have not gone down well with everyone At an impressive integrated emergency response centre there were housed state-of-the-art rescue vehicles and inside, a long wall covered in screens showing feeds from dozens of high-resolution security cameras around the city. Committing a crime and getting away with it is hard in Davao - and would you dare when the mayor has threatened to kill you? In a poorer part of town lives Clarita Aria, who runs a small market stall and lives in a cramped wooden shack behind it. She still weeps as she recalls how, over a period of six years four of her sons, all teenagers, were killed, after being warned by the police. The thought of Mayor Duterte winning the presidency fills her with sadness. But in much of the city he is celebrated as a hero. image copyright Reuters image caption Critics blame a young electorate with no memory of the regime of Ferdinand Marcos, for the political return of his family At the other end of the Philippines, in Iliocos Norte, Ferdinand Marcos is also feted as a hero and saviour, 30 years after he was overthrown in the first ""people power"" uprising. Back then, Marcos and his free-spending wife Imelda were vilified as symbols of greed, corruption and repression.  But today, the Marcos museum in his home town of Batac, which glorifies his life and achievements, is crowded with visitors from all over the country. Many of them are young - more than half of those eligible to vote were not born when Marcos was overthrown. Some came out won over by the melodramatic representation of Marcos's sacrifices they had watched inside, and the viewing they had of his embalmed body lying in state next door. image copyright Reuters image caption Despite thousands of deaths, Imelda Marcos' late husband is respected by many for big infrastructure projects, high exchange rates, and authoritarian rule His daughter, Imee, is governor of the province. Even Imelda, who at 86 is in poor health, is running unopposed as a congresswoman. A host of other Marcoses and their relatives are contesting many of the 240 or so positions up for grabs in the election. And his son Ferdinand Jr, or ""Bongbong"", has been leading the polls to win the vice-presidency - running a slick social media campaign, which appeals to the young in particular. In vain have the victims of the older Marcos's martial law, in which thousands were imprisoned and tortured, cried warnings about forgetting the past. When I asked Bongbong how much of a problem his father's reputation was he laughed: ""Quite the opposite - it's a boost"", he said.  image copyright Getty Images image caption While domestic issues have dominated, the election's foreign policy consequences could be felt as far away as Washington If the polls are correct, Mr Duterte and Mr Marcos could end up running this country. No-one is sure how they will do it, nor in what state they will leave this country's fragile democracy when they are finished. But after holding out so much promise when it was born 30 years ago, that democracy has delivered little of substance to most Filipinos, and they cannot be expected to care too much if it is put at risk.

The MPs will also examine the effect of social media on ""cyberstalking"". Plaid Cymru MP Elfyn Llwyd,  who leads the inquiry, said social media and new technology offered the means to anonymously target people.  He said cyberstalking was not covered by UK law, but a threat to ""potentially millions of vulnerable people"". The first session will also cover the work of the National Stalking Helpline.  Mr Llwyd, chair of the justice unions group, said the cross-party inquiry was the first independent examination of the issues in the UK. Interviewees will include academics, a psychologist and representatives from the Suzy Lamplugh Trust and the National Stalking Helpline. Written evidence will also be accepted from police, probation staff, magistrates, judges and stalking victims. It is hoped a parliamentary bill will be compiled in 2012. Mr Llwyd said: ""In 2010, 53,000 incidents of stalking and harassment were recorded by the police in the UK - just 2.2% of these cases resulted in a custodial sentence.  ""While it is not clear yet whether cyberstalking is a growing trend in isolation or just one more way in which to stalk someone, it is a worrying development.  ""We are surrounded by new technologies and social media - and unfortunately this is a way in which people can be anonymously targeted.  ""Cyberstalking is a very real threat to potentially millions of vulnerable people. Crucially - it is not covered by UK law.  'Lessen the threat' ""This is one of the reasons why the 1997 Protection from Harassment Act needs to be urgently reviewed."" He added: ""We'll hear more about the nature of cyberstalking in our first evidence session and we'll also hear from charities and operators of the National Stalking Helpline. ""Listening to the experts will help us to begin forming the case for where we go from here.  ""Together with reviewing the substantive law, we'll look at changing sentencing practices and guidelines. ""As part of the final recommendations, the group consider what treatment programmes need to be available for perpetrators so as to lessen the threat of re-offending.  ""We will also look at developing training for the police and the Probation Service to help them deal effectively with victims and perpetrators of stalking."" Laura Richards, from the Protection Against Stalking (PAS) charity, said: ""This is about homicide prevention.

The warning is in  a Ministry of Defence report  on artificial intelligence. Researchers in Silicon Valley are using strategy games, such as Starcraft II, to teach systems how to solve complex problems on their own. But artificial intelligence (AI) programs can then ""be readily adapted"" to wage cyber-warfare, the MoD says. Officials are particularly concerned about the ability of rogue states and terrorists to mount advanced persistent threat attacks, which can disable critical infrastructure and steal sensitive information. Human trounces AI at StarCraft game 'Nightmare' robots show off softer side AI plays video game to learn about world ""Not only will AI increase the variety and tempo of cyber-attacks, it will also decrease the cost and increase the variety of actors able to undertake this activity,"" the report says.  ""As the requirement for skilled specialists involved in the attack diminishes, the limitation will become access to the AI algorithms needed to conduct such an attack.  ""In other words, any actor with the financial resources to buy, or steal, an AI APT (advanced persistent threat) system could gain access to tremendous offensive cyber-capability, even if that actor is relatively ignorant of internet security technology.  ""Given that the cost of replicating software can be nearly zero, that may hardly present any constraint at all. This is likely to be a live issue by 2020 or soon thereafter.  ""For example, the state-of-the-art AI is being trained in tactical reasoning by playing computer strategy games.  ""AIs like this could then be readily adapted to drive APT cyber-attack tactics, where the AI is competing against human or non-adaptive automated cyber-defenders."" The report cites Google's DeepMind artificial intelligence research project, which is using Starcraft II - a real-time strategy game for PC and Mac users, launched in 2010 - to train programs to think for themselves. London-based DeepMind, which says it is committed to making the world a ""better place"" through artificial intelligence, by solving complex problems such as climate change, has also used Atari and Go games to train its systems. But, like other artificial intelligence researchers, those at DeepMind were attracted to the complexity and fast-moving nature of Starcraft, which involves a three-way conflict between humans, the insectoid Zerg and Protoss aliens.  image copyright YONHAP/ Reuters image caption Go player Lee Sedol pits his wits against Google's AI programme AlphaGo DeepMind said testing its artificial intelligence ""agents"" in games ""that are not specifically designed for artificial intelligence research, and where humans play well"" was ""crucial"" to their development.  Starcraft players build bases to gather resources that help make combat units to seek out and destroy opponents. Other technology companies, including Facebook, have now developed artificial intelligence bots to play the game after makers, Blizzard Entertainment, released tools to enable them to do so. Human players trounced artificial intelligence bots made by Facebook, DeepMind and other companies in a Starcraft tournament in November, suggesting there is still some way to go before the robots take over. Steven Murdoch, an information security research fellow at University College London, said artificial intelligence bots with the ability to carry out sophisticated cyber-attacks on their own were ""fairly far away"". Even those that could play games, such as Go and Starcraft, against humans were ""not very creative"" and relied on following ""a simple set of rules"".  ""As technology advances, more automation will be available, particularly for the delivery of malicious software, but the preparation of attacks and development of tactics will still require human expertise for the foreseeable future,"" he told BBC News. AI programs could be stolen and misused, as the MoD says in its report, but current systems ""are quite specific to a particular task and it takes considerable skill and expertise to adapt a system to a new application area,"" he added. The MoD report says the private sector is leading the way in artificial intelligence research - and the technology industry's reluctance to appear too close to defence or security agencies is creating a skills shortage in the military. ""Some Western commercial entities have publicly declared policies stating they will not contract with defence or security agencies, which may compound the challenges facing the MoD,"" says the report.  ""This is in stark contrast to other states, which have enshrined access rights to expertise, technology and data in their national legislation."" The report proposes setting up a register ""of security cleared UK nationals with AI and robotics skills"" to be called on in times of emergency.

The pair are allegedly part of a ""hacking group"" known as Advanced Persistent Threat 10 , affiliated with China's main intelligence service. They have not been arrested. The US and UK have accused China of violating an agreement relating to commercial espionage. Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong worked for a company called Huaying Haitai and in association with the Chinese Ministry of State Security, the US court filing says. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said that from at least 2006 until 2018, the two extensively hacked into computer systems with the aim of stealing intellectual property and confidential business and technological information from: at least 45 commercial and defence technology companies in at least 12 US states managed service providers (MSPs) and their government and commercial clients in at least 12 countries, including the UK, Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UAE, as well as the US US government agencies The FBI said they had also hacked into US Navy computer systems and stolen the personal information of more than 100,000 personnel. FBI director Christopher Wray said the two men were at present ""beyond US jurisdiction"". 'Economic aggression' Announcing the unsealing of the indictments, US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said China had violated a 2015 agreement under which it had pledged to not engage in commercial cyber-spying. image copyright AFP image caption US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein: ""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities"" Mr Rosenstein said his department's move had been co-ordinated with US allies in Europe and Asia to rebuff ""China's economic aggression"". He added: ""We want China to cease its illegal cyber activities."" The UK government said it was joining allies in holding the Chinese government responsible for a global campaign targeting commercial secrets. UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""This campaign is one of the most significant and widespread cyber intrusions against the UK and allies uncovered to date, targeting trade secrets and economies around the world. ""These activities must stop. They go against the commitments made to the UK in 2015, and, as part of the G20, not to conduct or support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property or trade secrets."" Australia and New Zealand said they too held China responsible for the global hacking campaign and joined their ""like-minded partners"" in condemning the activity. 'Chinese hackers return' By Gordon Corera, security correspondent This is the latest salvo in Washington's attempt to pressure Beijing on a range of issues, with economic espionage one of the most high-profile.  US and UK officials are reluctant to name the companies that have been hit but they say the economic damage has been significant. The hackers, officials say, work under the direction of China's Ministry of State Security - one of the country's intelligence organisations. ""It is organised more like a corporation than a gang,"" one UK official says, adding that British intelligence has the highest level of confidence in their assessment of who was responsible.  The UK and US believe China is breaking a 2015 agreement not to steal commercial data to help its companies. There was a dip in activity after the deal was signed (which followed a period of pressure by Washington, including the indictment of Chinese military hackers and the threat of sanctions).  But US and UK sources both say that recently they have seen Chinese hackers return, now operating more stealthily, whereas in the past they were easier to spot.   Where the US has been vocal in recent months, this is the first time the UK has spoken out - perhaps because it has been concerned about risking trade ties and getting pulled into the Trump administration's broader confrontation with Beijing.   UK officials say they have raised the matter privately a number of times with Beijing over the last two years, including during the prime minister's visit earlier this year, and officials are keen to stress that they think the relationship with China is strong enough to allow them to address these issues without causing wider problems.

Working with mobile security firm Lookout, researchers discovered that malware in fake messaging designed to look like WhatsApp and Signal had stolen gigabytes of data. Targets included military personnel, activists, journalists and lawyers. Researchers say they traced the malware to a Lebanese government building. The threat, dubbed Dark Caracal by the researchers, looks as if it could come from a nation state and appears to use shared infrastructure linked to other nation-state hackers,  the report said. The malware takes advantage of known exploits and targets mainly Android phones. Data was traced back to a server in a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut, according to researchers. ""Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal,"" the report said. Mobile threat ""People in the US, Canada, Germany, Lebanon, and France have been hit by Dark Caracal. Targets include military personnel, activists, journalists, and lawyers, and the types of stolen data range from call records and audio recordings to documents and photos,"" said EFF director of cybersecurity Eva Galperin.  ""This is a very large, global campaign, focused on mobile devices. Mobile is the future of spying, because phones are full of so much data about a person's day-to-day life."" Mike Murray, vice-president of security intelligence at Lookout said: ""Dark Caracal is part of a trend we've seen mounting over the past year whereby traditional advanced persistent threat actors are moving toward using mobile as a primary target platform."" Online mercenaries In a statement published on the Lookout blog, Google said it was confident that the infected apps were not downloaded from its Play Store. ""Google has identified the apps associated with this actor, none of the apps were on the Google Play Store. Google Play Protect has been updated to protect user devices from these apps and is in the process of removing them from all affected devices."" The researchers believe Dark Caracal has been operating since 2012 but it has been hard to track because of the diversity of seemingly unrelated espionage campaigns originating from the same domain names. Over the years Dark Caracal's work has been repeatedly misattributed to other cybercrime groups, the researchers said. In November, Afghanistan moved to ban WhatsApp and Telegram as a way to stop insurgent groups from using encrypted messaging. And in December, Iran moved to restrict use of the apps after a series of anti-establishment protests. Use of an app that can steal data would give nation states much more information than simply banning them, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""It is always hard to prove that a nation state is involved. During the Cold War, countries made use of mercenaries and that's what we are seeing online now."" He said it was unclear where the infected apps had been downloaded from. ""Google is saying that they were not downloaded from there but it is difficult to know where else they came from. It may be that people are getting suckered into something that looks like an official site. People need to be careful what they are downloading.""

The gang allegedly seeded websites with malware that gave them access to victims' PCs and, from there, their bank accounts. Technical tricks used by the hackers made it hard for security software to spot the malicious code once it had compromised a machine. It is believed to be the largest ever arrest of hackers in Russia. The Russian authorities carried out raids in 15 regions across the country to round up the gang, the FSB internal security service said. ""As a result of [house] searches a large quantity of computer equipment was confiscated along with communications gear, bank cards in false names, and also financial documents and significant amounts of cash confirming the illegal nature of their activity,"" the FSB said. The gang is believed to have stolen cash using a malicious trojan called Lurk that it hid on some of Russia's most popular websites.  Remote access Anyone visiting a website booby-trapped with Lurk would be infected with the malware. Once on a victim's PC, the malware then downloaded more software modules, giving the cyber thieves remote access to the machine.  This was used to steal login names and passwords for online bank accounts. In particular, they targeted accounts held at Sberbank - one of Russia's largest banks. ""Lurk started attacking banks one-and-a-half years ago; before then its malicious program targeted various enterprise and consumer systems,"" said Ruslan Stoyanov, head of computer incident investigation at Kaspersky Lab that helped uncover the gang's activities.  Mr Stoyanov said Kaspersky helped police profile the gang's network of computers and servers used to grab cash, and from that information they were able to trace the individuals involved.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The Lurk gang targeted Sberbank, its clients and customers The arrests helped to thwart pending money transfers that would have netted the group a further 2.3bn roubles, the FSB said. Russian security firm Group IB, which profiles cyber crime groups in Eastern Europe, said the Lurk gang had been operating since 2011.  The group initially went after clients of banks but had recently changed focus, said Group IB spokesman Victor Ivanovsky. ""In recent months we have detected a growing activity in performing Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attacks on Russian banks by the Lurk group,"" he said. Attacks that use APT techniques are typically the hardest to defend against because they are carefully customised for each target and can exploit formerly unknown vulnerabilities to get around security software.  The Lurk group switched to APT-based attacks in early 2016 when the source code for the well-known Buhtrap malware was made public.  The gang used Buhtrap to craft emails that looked like they came from industry groups that certify bank and accounting staff, in an attempt to trick people into opening messages containing Lurk.

The attack is said to have hit more than 300,000 computers in 150 nations, causing billions of dollars of damage. It is the first time the US and UK have officially blamed them for the worm. Thomas Bossert, an aide to US President Donald Trump, first made the accusation in the  Wall Street Journal  newspaper. Mr Bossert, who advises the president on homeland security, said the allegation was ""based on evidence"". He did not produce any evidence in the article, but said US findings concurred with judgments from other governments and private companies. He added that Australia, Canada, and New Zealand also share the US conclusion that North Korea was behind the attack. Following the interview, the UK Foreign Office also blamed ""North Korean actors using their cyber programme to circumvent sanctions"". The National Cyber Security Centre assessed that is ""highly likely"" that the North Korean Lazarus hacking group had committed the attacks,  Minister for Cyber Lord Ahmad said in a statement . In May, Windows computers hit by the cyber-attack had their contents locked, with users asked to a pay a ransom to have their data restored. EU police body Europol called the scale of the attack ""unprecedented"". Why blame N Korea now? Analysis: Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent  Britain's National Cyber Security Centre, part of the GCHQ signals intelligence agency, first attributed the May 2017 Wannacry attack to North Korea within weeks of the ransomware spreading.  The speed was because the UK led the international investigation after the National Health Service was hit hard.  The US intelligence community may have taken longer to concur with that assessment but there is still the question of why the White House is only going public now.  Governments used to be cautious about attribution in cyber attacks but it is becoming increasingly common - beginning with the claim North Korea was behind the attack on Sony in 2014 and more recently involving Russia's alleged hacking in the 2016 US election.  This latest claim is almost certainly an attempt to put more pressure on North Korea in the crisis over its nuclear programme with the attempt to rally international support behind the notion that the country is a real danger - whether from cyber weapons or nuclear weapons. And to make the case that further action, of some kind, needs to be contemplated. image copyright Reuters image caption Mr Bossert warned that ""we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us"" In the Wall Street Journal piece, Mr Bossert said North Korea must be held ""accountable"" and that the US would continue to use a ""maximum pressure strategy"" to hinder the regime's ability to mount cyber-attacks. He did not specify what action, if any, the US government planned to take in response to the findings. North Korea is already facing major economic sanctions after being redesignated a state-sponsor of terrorism last month  amid tension over its nuclear programme and missile tests.  Malware, patches and worms defined UK say cyber-attack was 'launched from North Korea' ""North Korea has acted especially badly, largely unchecked, for more than a decade, and its malicious behaviour is growing more egregious. WannaCry was indiscriminately reckless,"" Mr Bossert wrote.   ""As we make the internet safer, we will continue to hold accountable those who harm or threaten us, whether they act alone or on behalf of criminal organisations or hostile nations,"" he went on. ""The tool kits of totalitarian regimes are too threatening to ignore.""  He added that Microsoft and Facebook both acted to disable North Korean cyber-attacks ""on their own initiative last week, without any direction or participation by the US"". Microsoft later issued a statement,  saying that last week the company ""working together with Facebook and others in the security community, took strong steps to protect our customers and the internet from ongoing attacks by an advanced persistent threat actor known to us as ZINC, also known as the Lazarus Group"". ""Among other steps, last week we helped disrupt the malware this group relies on, cleaned customers' infected computers, disabled accounts being used to pursue cyber-attacks and strengthened Windows defences to prevent reinfection,"" the statement said.

The attacks were allegedly targeted at systems that move troops and equipment. They included breaking in to computers on a commercial ship and uploading malicious software on to an airline's computers, the Senate report alleged. Chinese officials denied the allegations. A year-long investigation  was concluded in March, but the findings have only just been made public. In a 12-month period from June 2012, it found evidence of about 50 cyber-attacks on military contractors.  Of those, 20 were attributed to ""an advanced persistent threat"", a term associated with attacks on governments. All were attributed to China. The report did not disclose the names of the affected contractors. ""These peacetime intrusions into the networks of key defence contractors are more evidence of China's aggressive actions in cyberspace,"" senator Carl Levin, chairman of the committee, said. Chinese embassy officials in Washington questioned the report, calling the accusations ""groundless"". The row between China and the US over cyber-attacks has been a long-running one. The Chinese government has previously accused US spies of infiltrating its computer networks. In May the US government accused five Chinese military members of hacking into and stealing trade secrets from the computers of several large US companies. Clearinghouse The latest report revealed that officials had only been told about two of these incidents. It also found that US government agencies had failed to share the information about the attacks among themselves. This lack of transparency from contractors has raised questions and prompted calls for new procedures about how such hacks are reported. Senator Jim Inhofe, who sits on the committee, called for a central clearinghouse to make it easier for contractors to report suspicious cyber-activity. According to the report, contractors are only required to report network-level cyber-intrusions.  Paul Dignan, from security firm F5 Networks, said: ""A lot of attacks target end-users with malware so that they can piggyback on legitimate access to the network. ""Firms use lots of security vendors but there are also lots of gaps and, without adequate integration, it is these gaps that will be exploited.""

The breaches were first  publicised by security blogger Brian Krebs  on Monday. The companies denied their classified networks had been infiltrated. However, the team that discovered the incidents has given the BBC access to an intelligence report, which indicates hundreds of files were indeed copied. The documents, which were stolen over a period of many months, relate to: Arrow III missiles unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly known as drones ballistic rockets Cyber Engineering Services (CyberESI) tracked the activities of the hackers over eight months between 2011 and 2012. It said the data taken by the hackers suggested they had been after intelligence relating to Iron Dome. Iron Dome is a complex anti-missile defence system, which can intercept and destroy rockets and shells. The technology has been widely credited with preventing the deaths of many Israeli civilians during the ongoing conflict with militants from Gaza. CyberESI's report, compiled in 2013, also indicates the attacks were made using highly sophisticated tools resembling those used by Chinese hackers to infiltrate US defence firms - an attack in which the Chinese government denies any involvement. image copyright Getty Images image caption Former Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert stands next to a Rafael missile ""The data collected makes strong indications that the actors behind this attack originated from China,"" it says. ""This assertion is based on the activity during the past year that Cyber Engineering Services has observed on compromised networks, as well as the geo-location of the IP [internet protocol] addresses retrieving the exfiltrated data."" ""The nature of exfiltrated data and the industry that these companies are involved in suggests that the Chinese hackers were after information related to Israel's all-weather air defence system called Iron Dome."" Gigabytes stolen CyberESI, which operates out of Maryland in the US, monitored data being stolen from two leading Israeli defence contractors: Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), a government-owned company that develops missiles and aircraft Rafael Advanced Defense Systems, a government-owned company established in 1948, which develops surface-to-air missiles A spokeswoman for IAI initially confirmed to Mr Krebs the attack had taken place and been ""reported to the appropriate authorities"". However IAI subsequently said the ""information reported regarding the leakage of sensitive information is incorrect"" and only its ""civilian non-classified"" network had been hacked. A spokesman for Rafael said the company did ""not recall such an incident"". image copyright AP image caption The hackers allegedly took documents related to the Arrow missile But the report seen by the BBC suggests sensitive data was taken from IAI and that Rafael's network was compromised, with hackers able to deactivate security software and harvest authentication data, including passwords. In total, the report says, gigabytes of data were stolen from the Israeli companies, including: word documents power point presentations spreadsheets PDFs executable (.exe) files Some of the stolen technical documents are said by CyberESI to have contained intellectual property data and were marked as being controlled by US government International Traffic in Arms (ITAR) regulations.  US connections Both IAI and Rafael were heavily involved in developing the Iron Dome missile defence system, which allows Israel to intercept rockets fired by Hamas from the Gaza Strip.  The US, which already collaborates with Israeli firms over Arrow III - jointly designed by IAI and Boeing, now wants to invest in future versions of Iron Dome technologies. In May 2013, the Pentagon accused China of carrying out a sophisticated cyber-spying campaign on US diplomatic, economic and defence organisations. The raid on the Israeli companies bore similar characteristics, experts at CyberESI told the BBC, using tools that were ""known to originate from"" China. The attacks were part of an advanced persistent threat (APT) - a form of highly organised and targeted hacking. APTs have been used for industrial espionage in the past and tend to use sophisticated methods not easily available to the vast majority of cyber-thieves.  image copyright AFP image caption The US wants to invest in future versions of Iron Dome technologies Executive emails stolen CyberESI's report also featured a third Israeli company, Elisra, originally a US company and now a leading supplier to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Elisra, which is not involved in Iron Dome, appears to have been comprehensively infiltrated by the hackers, who stole data from folders named ""Military Spacs"" and ""UAV"" and infiltrated the email accounts belonging to the chief executive and several senior managers. The attackers also stole passwords and sign-in details, allowing them to roam around the networks undetected.  Elisra did not respond to a BBC request for comment. In January 2014, another security company reported that 15 Israeli defence computers had been compromised via a malicious email attachment.

In a statement, the Defence Ministry said the report lacked ""technical proof"" when it used IP addresses to link hacking to a military unit.  The report identified a Shanghai high-rise used by the military as the likely home of a hackers to whom it attributed multiple attacks on US companies.   The US says it has repeatedly raised concerns with China about cyber theft.  The Chinese ministry statement, posted on its website, said that many hacking attacks were carried out using hijacked IP addresses. There was no clear definition of what constituted a hacking attack, it went on, and as it was a cross-border, deceptive business, it was hard to pin down where attacks originated. It suggested that the ""everyday gathering"" of online information was being wrongly characterised as spying.  'Cyber espionage' The detailed report, released on Tuesday by US-based computer security company Mandiant , looked at hundreds of data breaches, most of which it attributed to what it termed ""Advanced Persistent Threat"" actors. The details it had uncovered, it said, showed that these groups were based primarily in China and that the Beijing government was aware of them. The most prolific of these actors was APT1, Mandiant said, describing it as ""one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen"".  The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to a Shanghai building. Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army ""is also located in precisely the same area"" and the actors had similar ""missions, capabilities and resources"", it added. APT1, it said, was staffed by hundreds of proficient English speakers. It had hacked into 141 companies across 20 industries, stealing information including blueprints, business plans, pricing documents, user credentials, emails and contact lists.  Spokesman Jay Carney said the White House was ""aware"" of the Mandiant report and its contents. While not commenting directly, he described cyber espionage as a ""very important challenge"".  ""We have repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber-theft with senior Chinese officials including in the military and we will continue to do so,"" he said.   State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland, meanwhile, said that the issue came up ""in virtually every meeting we have with Chinese officials"".    ""We consider this kind of activity a threat not only to our national security but also to our economic interests and [we are] laying out our concerns specifically so that we can see if there's a path forward,"" she said. China has long been suspected of a role in cyber hacking. But the issue has become more high-profile in recent months following widely reported hacks into media outlets including the New York Times - in that case apparently linked to a report by the paper on the wealth of relatives of outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao.  The Chinese Defence Ministry statement pointed out that China was also a victim of hacking attacks.  A Global Times editorial accused the US and its major allies of hyping up a China hacking ""threat"".  ""China should refute the allegations of US company Mandiant with authoritative reports from its technology sector,"" it said.  ""As a long-term counter-measure, China needs to encourage those institutions and individuals who have been subject to cyber-attacks from US IP addresses to stand up and tell the world what happened to them.""

They point to the sophisticated nature of the attack and the resources needed to develop it. Malicious software, designed to steal confidential files, was installed on at least one IMF computer. Although government involvement is widely suspected, the IMF has not released enough details to be sure. Digital insider Based on the limited information made public, it appears that the attack came from a specific PC that had been deliberately infected. Hacker software was likely to have been installed on it in what is known as a spear-phishing attack, which sees highly targeted scam e-mails sent to specific victims. A memo circulated internally at the IMF reported that ""suspicious file transfers"" had been detected. Tom Kellerman, a security expert who has worked for the IMF and now sits on the board of the International Cyber Security Protection Alliance told Reuters news agency that it was ""a targeted attack"" with code written specifically to give a nation state a ""digital insider presence"" on the IMF network. Graham Titherington, a security analyst with research firm Ovum agreed with the nation state theory. ""Any attack that shows money, time and resources went on it points to a state attack. States and their intelligence agencies have far more resources than criminal gangs,"" he said. The information held by the IMF would clearly be most valuable to a country, he added. ""It has masses of economic information from the performance of countries to the state of their balance sheets. For countries deciding where to invest it is invaluable,"" he said. State-sponsored hacking has gained prominence in recent months. ""Google shifted the debate by going public on a hack attack believed to be by China,"" said Mr Titherington. The Chinese government has denied involvement in the recent attack on Google's e-mail accounts. The incident compromised the personal Gmail accounts of hundreds of top US officials, military personnel and journalists. Google said that the campaign to obtain passwords originated in the Chinese city of Jinan and was aimed at monitoring e-mail. According to Mark Darvill, director of security firm AEP Networks, many countries are involved in cyber espionage but China remained at the ""forefront"". ""China has recently set up a cyber terrorism unit which is very likely to be looking at opportunities rather than to stop attacks,"" he said. Convenient excuse Not everyone is convinced that state-sponsored attacks or Advanced Persistent Threat (APTs) are the cause of the IMF hack. Tal Be'ery, a web researcher at security firm Imperva said it could be a ""convenient excuse"". ""It is easier for organisations to hide under this excuse when really it is something lacking in their defences.  ""We don't have enough credible information about the IMF attack. It needs to provide good evidence that it was a APT. It is just as likely to be a lone hacker acting out of curiosity,"" he said. The most high profile state-sponsored attack to date remains the Stuxnet worm, which targeted Iran's nuclear facilities. Experts believe the complex malicious code originated from either the Israeli or US governments.

Mandiant said Unit 61398 was believed to have ""systematically stolen hundreds of terabytes of data"" from at least 141 organisations around the world. The White House said it has taken its concerns about cyber-theft to the highest levels of China's government. China has denied hacking and questioned Mandiant's report. ""Hacking attacks are transnational and anonymous,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Hong Lei. ""Determining their origins are extremely difficult. We don't know how the evidence in this so-called report can be tenable. Mr Hong added that Beijing ""firmly opposes hacking"", has taken steps to prevent it and is also a victim of cyber attacks. In an indication of the military sensitivity around the Shanghai site pinpointed by the report as home to the hacking group, the BBC's John Sudworth and his camera crew were briefly detained by soldiers when they went to film the facility. They were only released once they had handed over their footage. 'Extensive campaign' In its unusually detailed report,  US-based computer security company Mandiant said it had investigated hundreds of data breaches since 2004, most of which it attributed to what it termed ""Advanced Persistent Threat"" actors. The details it had uncovered, it said, ""convince us that the groups conducting these activities are based primarily in China and that the Chinese government is aware of them"". The most prolific of these actors is APT1, which Mandiant says is ""a single organisation of operators that has conducted a cyber espionage campaign against a broad range of victims since at least 2006"".  ""From our observations, it is one of the most prolific cyber espionage groups in terms of the sheer quantity of information stolen,"" it said, adding that it was ""likely government-sponsored and one of the most persistent of China's cyber threat actors"".  ""We believe that APT1 is able to wage such a long-running and extensive cyber espionage campaign in large part because it receives direct government support,"" said Mandiant. The firm said it had traced the hacking activities of APT1 to the site of 12-storey building in the Pudong area of Shanghai. It said that Unit 61398 of the People's Liberation Army ""is also located in precisely the same area"" and that the actors had similar ""missions, capabilities and resources"". Among the findings about APT1 in the report were that it: is staffed by hundreds, possibly thousands, of proficient English speakers with advanced computer security and networking skills has hacked into 141 companies across 20 industries, 87% based in English-speaking countries, and is able to steal from dozens of networks simultaneously has stolen hundreds of terabytes of information including blueprints, business plans, pricing documents, user credentials, emails and contact lists  stayed inside hacked networks for an average of 356 days, with the longest lasting 1,764 days targeted industries identified by China as strategically important under its Five Year Plan for economic growth 'Groundless' Unit 61398 has for some time been suspected by the US of being central to China's cyber espionage programme, the New York Times reports.  Mandiant admitted there could be one alternative explanation for its findings: that ""a secret, resourced organisation full of mainland Chinese speakers with direct access to Shanghai-based telecommunications infrastructure is engaged in a multi-year, enterprise scale computer espionage campaign right outside of Unit 61398's gates, performing tasks similar to Unit 61398's known mission"". Several governments, foreign companies and organisations have said in the past they suspect China of carrying out extensive cyber espionage over periods of several years. On Tuesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the Obama administration had ""repeatedly raised our concerns at the highest levels about cyber theft with senior Chinese officials including in the military and we will continue to do so"".  Mr Carney declined to comment specifically on the contents of the report. Last month, the New York Times said its systems had been infiltrated over a period of four months, after it wrote a report on the alleged wealth of China's outgoing Premier Wen Jiabao. Mandiant, which the paper hired to investigate, traced the hack to China. However, the paper said its breach had been attributed to a different group. The Wall Street Journal also reported a China-based hack. At the time, China's foreign ministry dismissed the New York Times accusations as ""groundless"", saying that to ""conclude without hard evidence that China participated in such hacking attacks is totally irresponsible"".

The security company  said it had evidence  a further 19 companies, including defence specialists, had also been affected. It said the attacks began in late July and lasted until mid-September. Symantec said the campaign was focused on intellectual property, including formulas and design processes. While the report did not reveal the names of any of the companies involved, it did say they included Fortune 100 firms.  It disclosed that at least 12 of the infected companies were based in the US, five in the UK, and two in Denmark. Several of the firms were also said to have developed materials for military vehicles. US giant Dow Chemicals confirmed to the BBC that it had been the target of ""unusual emails"" received during the summer. ""Dow engaged internal and external response teams, including law enforcement, to address the situation,"" he said.  ""As a result, we have no reason to believe our operations were compromised."" Trojans Symantec said workers at the organisations were sent emails asking them to open an attachment. It said in some cases they claimed to be invitations from established business partners, in others a security update. The firm said if the attachments were opened they installed a piece of code known as a Trojan horse, which allowed the hackers to obtain details of the targets' computer networks. The attackers were then able to use this information to locate and copy files to another part of their targets' systems, from where they were extracted.  Symantec identified the Trojan involved as PoisonIvy, which it said was developed by a Chinese speaker. The firm also said it had traced the attacks back to a ""20-something male located in the Hebei region of China"" who funnelled the process through a US computer server. Symantec said that when prompted, the man provided contact details for someone who would ""perform hacking for hire"". However, the company was unable to establish whether this was the same person or a different individual. The incidents are being linked to earlier attacks on carmakers and human rights organisations. ""This is unfortunately becoming a new normal behaviour,"" Symantec's chief technology officer, Greg Day, told the BBC. ""We had at least a decade of cybercrime which generally targeted anybody. Then we had the emergence of very skilled techniques involving a lot of time and effort to target global organisations."" ""What we have now is almost the commercialisation of those techniques, using elements such as advanced persistent threats to pursue espionage and intellectual property theft, whether that is for their own gain or resale.""

Advanced+Persistent+Threat|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-16288247|"Fantastic futures? Technology and business in 2012 By Fiona Graham Technology of business reporter, BBC News Published 27 December 2011 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption Look into the ball: What does 2012 hold for business technology? Although those of us following the Mayan long calendar may be heading into 2012 with some trepidation, for those taking a longer-term view here is our annual peek into what next year holds. Just as there are 12 days of Christmas, 12 people from across the technology spectrum give their insights to what the next year will hold.  We have the first six here, with part two following on Friday. It's been a  turbulent year for technology , and enterprise is no exception.  The consumerisation of IT continues apace with more and more of us bringing our own devices to work. Cloud computing seems to be almost ubiquitous and virtualisation no longer sounds like something to do with the transporter in Star Trek.  These topics and more all  made it into last year's predictions . So what do the experts think is hovering on the horizon in 2012? Tom Standage - Digital Editor, The Economist Number one would be social networking in business. I think this is going to be very significant, because there are a number of reasons why companies might want to do this. I think they've been slow to because of the perception that using social networks is wasting time, what you might call social not-working. image caption Tom Standage sees 2012 as the year NFC will finally take off And in fact the opposite is true. I think the chances are that the future of enterprise software looks like Facebook.  We're seeing some companies adopting this already through systems like Chatter, Salesforce, Yammer and Jive - there's a whole bunch of them. The other thing of course is that people entering the workforce at this point are used to using social media, so if you give them enterprise software that looks like Facebook, they'll feel right at home.  Another thing to watch for is that Google may lose control of Android. It's because the tablet market is going to be divided between Amazon and Apple from the looks of things. It's very hard to see how anyone else can get in in the middle.  image caption The future of enterprise software looks like Facebook Amazon can subsidise the cost of its tablets using subsidies from the sale of content and other things. They are essentially portable shops, a very clever idea.  I think it's entirely possible that they dominate at the bottom end, and Apple dominates at the top end because it has scale, it can buy screen and processing power like no-one else can and it has the pricing power of its incredibly strong brand.  This is a problem for Google because if this does happen that means that the dominant kind of Android tablet is the kind where Android itself is sort of hidden and is controlled by Amazon. The third thing is what happens to Research in Motion (RIM). Someone will buy them I think. The question is will they buy the whole of RIM in its current form. image caption Blackberries for sale - and will manufacturer Research in Motion be bought as well? RIM itself could split in two into its hardware and services division and start offering Blackberry services as an app. I would be very surprised if RIM is still a company in its current form this time next year. One of my predictions from last year I would like to reiterate, and that is wireless payments.  I was expecting the iPhone that came out this year to have an NFC (near field communication) chip in it and to shake up wireless payments.  It didn't happen. I'm still convinced it's going to happen, I think it's going to happen next year, and the iPhone 5 will have an NFC chip in it.  This I predict will be the latest example of where Apple blesses a technology that is out there but not really being done properly, and Apple comes along and goes: ""This is how you do it."" Elissa Fink - Tableau Software Firstly big data is just getting bigger and starting to really impact not just the IT organisations and the people that know how to deal with data, but also the everyday knowledge worker, the everyday manager, and the everyday business leader, who have a lot of data they need to get through to make good decisions. image caption Even more adoption of mobile technologies will take place in businesses Number two is that the pace is quickening towards making enterprise software more like consumer software. Making it easier to use, faster, with far less training than ever before. And then number three would be mobile. Mobile adoption is going mainstream [in business]. Organisations are adopting tablets and particularly the iPad at very fast rates, and people want to be able to access their information wherever they are, even if it's just in a meeting next door. I would say [these are] the top three trends we're seeing, in no particular order. William Dudley - Group director, operator services, Sybase 365 I think we're going to see significant press not from Apple but about Apple. My prediction is that one of the things the iPhone 5 will do that will be significant will be to support NFC. NFC is just a trigger to start the process of paying for goods. But NFC doesn't do any good unless merchants have a point of sale capability to accept that.  image caption The next incarnation of the iPhone will be a major moment in 2012, says William Dudley And given that Apple has a tremendous database around their app store and iTunes, I would suspect that Apple would want to play a part in creating a point of sale ecosystem.  I don't have a lot of details but I kind of suspect that this could be a place where they could play and have a big impact. Apple really has been a catalyst for multiple parts of the industry. Not to say that Google won't continue to accelerate their payment purchasing mobile service. Number two is probably around devices.  I think we're going to see Windows Phone not die a slow death but sort of hold its own.  I think RIM isn't done yet. Blackberry devices are popular worldwide and in some markets, in the Middle East and the UK, they're very popular. And they're certainly very well engrained in enterprises.  RIM has got some capabilities and features that the Apple, Android, even Windows Phones do not. So I would not count them out yet. Ben Holmes - Partner, Index Ventures There's been enormous coverage of 3D printing. When we invested last year [in a 3D printing company] it was still science fiction, but it is rapidly moving from science fiction to science fact. I think it's an incredibly powerful concept, the idea of consumers being able to choose and make devices and products themselves. I think it's just at that point where the costs are falling very rapidly that it's now becoming more affordable. Two years ago it was used by high-end architectural practices and by Formula One teams to design and prototype their engines. image caption 3D has evolved from science fiction to science fact (picture courtesy of Shapeways) I think increasingly the smartphone is becoming a sort of remote control for the world around you.  Already you can order your food through this device, you can use it to hail a cab, to find concerts, and control the heating in your house. Then there's mobile gaming. A lot of VCs (venture capitalists) are probably attacking this theme. Facebook gaming is massive - but mobile gaming is still pretty small despite the success of some big names like Angry Birds. I think a lot of the games which are doing well in iOS and Android, they are fairly crude rip-offs of what happens on Facebook. I think very few companies have really thought deeply about the types of games that fully leverage this device. I think there will be a Zynga-sized company or bigger built off the back of mobile.  Zynga has probably 50-60% of the social gaming market. The biggest company in mobile gaming has a 1.5% share. Neil Campbell - Global head of security, Dimension Data I think 2011 was the year of awareness when it comes to advanced persistent threats [an organised group or government that commits cyber attacks], and sadly 2012 will be the year that advanced persistent threats continue at an incredible pace to plague the internet.  And I say that because they're relatively simple in their execution, they're taking advantage of relatively simple vulnerabilities, and they produce a lot of output in the form of all the information that becomes available to the perpetrators - which can be used for a number of reasons from espionage to fraud to blackmail. image caption Neil Campbell predicts a tough year for cyber security Until that becomes very difficult to carry out, then we'll see the popularity of advanced persistent threats continue to increase. The thing that would stop the vulnerabilities being there is really basic security.  We've been talking about this for years. When you think about the effort it takes to secure a network, it tends to be getting it perfect that takes the effort, it should be relatively easy to secure the basics. What conversation could be carried out today without cloud sneaking in there?  The security needs of the cloud are down to the capabilities of the cloud provider, in the rush towards the cloud I'm sure there will be many situations where the two don't match. Bring your own device (BYOD) - which is the trend for people to buy their own [work] devices - can only increase as each generation becomes more computer literate. image caption The cloud could bring security conflicts between businesses and service providers That's left organisations with the choice of embracing that trend and proactively developing a stance and policies on BYOD.  If you ignore it people find ways to bring their favourite device to work and make it work. That can include things like setting up their own wireless access points or driving a hole through your firewall to access their email.  People can be very creative when it comes to using technology they love in the way that they want to use it. Steven Prentice - VP and analyst, Gartner The control that the IT department has traditionally had over IT is perhaps more illusory than they thought.  It is slipping away. The increasing use of mobile devices, and consumerisation, people using their own systems, social computing and social networking, collaboration tools, the rise in software as a service - business units are buying services as opposed to going to the IT department for systems. It is a challenging time and IT leaders need to be proactive in their approach and changing their attitudes.  The thing that's going to hit most organisations I think is the whole big data explosion.  It is driven by the wider internet of things, the proliferation of connected devices producing a mountain of data.  Organisations are always saying: give us better data to help us make better decisions. I think IT is on the verge of being able to deliver some of those things. It's not going to be easy, there are all sorts of technology variables to be weighed, but the data can be collected, the data can be analysed. I think the internet of things is going to be one of those potential game changers. Mobile has become or is becoming the dominant form of access to the internet.  I think that the whole social thing, the investment bubble on this is going to burst. We've seen some outrageous valuations during the dot.com boom. While I don't think that anyone is suggesting that social is going to go away, they're perhaps going to be a bit more realistic. Part two of our look ahead will be published on Friday, 30 December.

phishing|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419|"Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks? By Mary-Ann Russon Business reporter, BBC News Published 13 hours ago Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks. Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.  Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware. However,  the new report  comes on the back of a recent significant  security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system . And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with. So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried? How a firmware attack works  Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.  Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers. This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system. Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers unsecured Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber-crisis Cyber-flaw affects 745,000 pacemakers Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware. ""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.  Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security. ""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot."" image copyright Sophos image caption A screenshot of the RobbinHood ransomware There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as  RobbinHood , a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware  held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019 .  Another example is  Thunderspy , an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other. This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep. ""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.   ""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more."" Big organisations beware The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops). ""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC. Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software,  because they only make money  if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.  Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The pandemic has led to a sharp rise in devices connecting remotely to critical corporate network infrastructure The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws. The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years. Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.  Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.  Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds. ""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do."" Creeping soon to a network near you Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole,  to pay attention to hardware security . image copyright Getty Images image caption Hardware and firmware designers need to be included in the cyber-security discussion, say experts ""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.  ""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected."" Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.  ""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.  ""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""

phishing|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53607374|"Twitter hack: Staff tricked by phone spear-phishing scam Published 31 July 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Reuters The unprecedented hacking of celebrity Twitter accounts this month was caused by human error and a spear-phishing attack on Twitter employees, the company has confirmed. Spear-phishing  is a targeted attack designed to trick people into handing out information such as passwords. Twitter said its staff were targeted through their phones. The successful attempt let attackers tweet from celebrity accounts and access their private direct messages. The accounts of Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West were compromised, and shared a Bitcoin scam. It reportedly netted the scammers more than $100,000 (Â£80,000). The attack has raised concerns about the level of access that Twitter employees, and subsequently the hackers, have to user accounts. By obtaining employee credentials, they were able to target specific employees who had access to our account support tools. They then targeted 130 Twitter accounts - Tweeting from 45, accessing the DM inbox of 36, and downloading the Twitter Data of 7. — Twitter Support (@TwitterSupport)  July 31, 2020   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Twitter acknowledged that concern in its statement, saying that it was ""taking a hard look"" at how it could improve its permissions and processes. ""Access to these tools is strictly limited and is only granted for valid business reasons,"" the company said. Not all the employees targeted in the spear-phishing attack had access to the in-house tools, Twitter said - but they did have access to the internal network and other systems. Once the attackers had acquired user credentials to let them inside Twitter's network, the next stage of their attack was much easier. They targeted other employees who had access to account controls. Analysis By Joe Tidy, cyber-security reporter Twitter isn't clarifying whether or not their employees were duped by an email or a phone call. The consensus in the information security community is that it was the latter.  Phonecall spear-phishing, commonly known as vishing, is bread and butter for the sort of hackers who are suspected of this attack.  The criminals obtained the phone numbers of a handful of Twitter staff and, by using friendly persuasion and trickery, got them to hand over usernames and passwords that gave them an initial foothold into the internal system. Twitter hack: What went wrong and why it matters FBI investigates major Twitter hack As Twitter puts it, the scammers ""exploited human vulnerabilities"". You can imagine how it possibly went:  Hacker to Twitter employee: ""Hi, I'm new to the department and I've locked myself out of the Twitter internal portal, can you do me a huge favour and give me the login again?"" The fact that Twitter staff were susceptible to these basic attacks is embarrassing for a company built on being at the forefront of digital technology and internet culture.  Twitter said the initial spear-phishing attempt happened on 15 July - the same day the accounts were compromised, suggesting the accounts were accessed within hours. ""This attack relied on a significant and concerted attempt to mislead certain employees and exploit human vulnerabilities to gain access to our internal systems,"" the company said. ""This was a striking reminder of how important each person on our team is in protecting our service."" media caption Technology explained: What is phishing? Twitter did not state whether the attack involved voice calls, despite a previous report from Bloomberg stating that at least one Twitter employee was contacted by attackers through a phone call. Phishing is most commonly done by email and text message, encouraging recipients to click on links that take them to websites with fake log-in screens. Spear-phishing is a version of the scam targeted at one person or a specific company, and is usually heavily customised to make it more believable. One victim whose account was compromised told the BBC there were several things Twitter could have done differently. ""They shouldn't give the ability to a single employee to remove both email address on file and two-factor authentication,"" they said. ""I understand why there's a need for this - for example if a dormant account has a very old email that's inaccessible and you've lost your phone or something-  but it should require two employees to sign off."" They also said communication from Twitter was poor. ""It took 10 days to reset this account with no actual personal response from Twitter. I literally got a 'click here to continue' automated email from their system when they added my email back to the account to allow me to reset it - and it looked like a phishing email.""

""If you're tricked into revealing your log-in credentials, whether it's through the use of fake emails or malware, we know that Sci-Hub will then use those details to compromise your university's computer network in order to steal research papers,"" he said.

He warned that visitors to the website, whose Twitter account has been suspended, are ""very vulnerable to having their credentials stolen"". 'Access to research' The police warning says scientific papers could have been obtained by a ""variety of malicious means, such as the use of phishing emails to trick university staff and students into divulging their login credentials"".

Police began investigating Grant West, 26, after he conned details from Just Eat customers in 2015. The personal data of around 165,000 people was compromised. Detectives later found he had 63,000 credit and debit card details - and seized more than Â£500,000 in bitcoins belonging to West. He admitted charges including conspiracy to commit fraud, computer misuse, and drug offences. West, from the Isle of Sheppey in Kent, used ""phishing"" emails to extract customer data from various companies.  Between July 2015 and December 2015 he targeted online food delivery firm Just Eat, using a scam in which customers received a bogus email offering a voucher in return for answering questions about the service.  image caption Grant West sent fake emails to customers offering vouchers The emails allowed West to harvest information - including customers' names, addresses and payment card details - in order to sell to other criminals. There is no suggestion that Just Eat's own computer systems were hacked or compromised.  Detectives believe he targeted customers of just about every major online vendor, from ""Argos to Uber"", as part of his criminal enterprise, using millions of email addresses to indiscriminately trick people into revealing their financial information. Once he had a complete set of customer details he would sell them on via the now-defunct online dark web market Alpha Bay, with the user name ""courvoisier"". The details were sold as ""Fullz"" - a slang term on the dark web used to describe a full set of customer details that would allow others to defraud individual bank accounts and credit cards.  image caption West would ask Just Eat customers to answer questions about the service The courvoisier account sold details belonging to 9,627 people - many of whom lost significant amounts to other online fraudsters. Police say West made more than Â£180,000 from the scam. The proceeds from his business were converted into Bitcoins and stored in multiple accounts.  The Just Eat phishing scam cost the firm more than Â£200,000 - but also gave specialist detectives from London's Metropolitan Police their first lead. West used his girlfriend's laptop and police traced the computer via a series of IP addresses, despite his best efforts to cover his digital tracks. As detectives moved in on West they realised that getting their hands on the laptop with his ""fingers on the keyboard"" was crucial.  A team of covert officers tracked West and while he was using the computer in the first class carriage on a train from Rhyl to London officers pounced on him, seizing the unlocked computer.  The arrest was captured on the train's CCTV. On the laptop they found the financial information of more than 100,000 people.      image caption The dark web page used by West Officers also raided West's home address and found an SD card with the details of 63,000 debit and credit cards, seven million email addresses with passwords, and the details of more than 500 companies - all the components required to commit mass online fraud. They also seized Â£25,000 in cash and half a kilogram of cannabis.  As well as financial information, West also sold cannabis online - which he shipped to customers - and ""how to"" guides for fellow hackers.  Police say West treated his fraudulent activity as a ""day job"", sometimes spending 18 hours a day hacking financial information and doing online deals.  At first sight his lifestyle was simple - the family home was a caravan in a residential park - but West funded luxury holidays and goods with stolen credit card details.  His former girlfriend, Rachael Brookes, 26, from North Wales, also enjoyed the cash generated by the frauds. At one point using stolen details to buy a new bikini.  She was sentenced on Wednesday to a community order after pleading guilty to unauthorised access of computer material. His Honour Judge Michael Gledhill QC told Ms Brookes that she was ""very fortunate indeed"" not to be jailed and said of her relationship with West that she had ""fallen into the arms of a villain and a rogue"". image caption West used his girlfriend Rachael Brookes' laptop for his criminal activities West has no formal qualifications and, although he directed the frauds, investigators believe he was working with others. Bitcoin ""wallets"" belonging to West were emptied the day after he was arrested. At current prices those Bitcoins are estimated to be worth Â£1.5m.  Detective Chief Superintendent Michael Gallagher - who led the investigation - said police were ""uncovering the darkness and shady areas"" where criminals operate on the dark web, and were ""bringing them into the light"".   ""There was a myth that Bitcoin in particular, and crypto-currencies more generally, was anonymous and it was also a myth that people can operate with impunity on the dark web and remain anonymous,"" he said. A spokesperson for Just Eat said ""We were made aware of a phishing scam which took place in 2015 and at the time took steps to mitigate thisâ¦ at no point were Just Eat systems compromised or breached. ""Protecting our brand and our customers from online fraud is of utmost importance to us.""  West will be sentenced on 25 May.

Dark tips The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.  Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers. Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines. Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again. image caption Details can be stolen in a variety of ways There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019. There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones. Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.  Beware Christmas parcel delivery scams, banks warn Banks 'too often blaming customers' for fraud Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police."" Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses.

Users took to social media to complain about the emails, which claim to be an order confirmation from the fast-food chain and contain links to malware. The emails also use the victims' names, and appear to come from the chain's Subcard loyalty scheme. Subway has not said whether its databases have been compromised or what the source of the scam is. But the firm has acknowledged that there is a problem. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We are aware of some disruption to our email systems and understand some of our guests have received an unauthorised email."" It apologised for any inconvenience and advised people to delete the email. Sandwich insurance The problem was earlier reported by computer security news site Bleeping Computer , which said it had found a form of malware called TrickBot in the malicious links the email encourages users to click. Trickbot is designed to steal personal information from infected computers, and can also install other viruses and ransomware. The email links to fake documents that supposedly need to be confirmed - including insurance documents for the sandwich, suggesting that the attack had been repurposed from an existing scam. Bleeping Computer reports that these documents include an Excel spreadsheet download, which asks users to enable additional features that install the virus. It is not clear how the attacker accessed the details of customers. Online, some recipients claimed that the attack email appeared to come from the address that the company usually uses. Update 12 December: Subway has issued a fresh statement: ""Having investigated the matter, we have no evidence that guest accounts have been hacked. However, the system which manages our email campaigns has been compromised, leading to a phishing campaign that involved first name and email. The system does not hold any bank or credit card details. Crisis protocol was initiated and compromised systems locked down. The safety of our guests and their personal data is our overriding priority and we apologise for any inconvenience this may have caused.""

The company says it tracked a campaign aimed at the delivery ""cold chain"" used to keep vaccines at the right temperature during transportation. The attackers' identity is unclear - but IBM said the sophistication of their methods indicated a nation state. It follows warnings from governments - including the UK's - of countries targeting aspects of vaccine research. Phishing emails IBM says it believes the campaign started in September 2020.  It says phishing emails were sent out across six countries, which targeted organisations linked to the Cold Chain Equipment Optimisation Platform (CCEOP) of Gavi, the international vaccine alliance. Gavi's partners include the World Health Organization, Unicef, the World Bank and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. They help distribute vaccines around the world to some of the poorest regions. This sometimes requires a ""cold chain"".  Malicious code For example, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - which was not the specific target of this campaign - will need to be kept at a temperature of about -70C as it is moved about. The attackers impersonated a business executive from a legitimate Chinese company involved in CCEOP's supply cold chain to make it more likely the targets would engage with the email. They then sent phishing emails to organisations that provided transportation, which contained malicious code and asked for people's log in credentials.  That could have allowed them to understand the infrastructure that governments intended to use to distribute vaccines.  ""Advanced insight into the purchase and movement of a vaccine that can impact life and the global economy is likely a high-value and high-priority nation-state target,"" IBM says. 'Precision targeting' IBM says the wider targeting included: the European Commission's Directorate General Taxation and Customs Union companies involved in manufacturing solar panels, which can be used to keep vaccines cold in places where reliable power is not available a South Korean software-development company a German website-development company, which supports clients associated with pharmaceutical manufacturers, container transport, biotechnology and manufacturers of electrical components for communications media caption Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world. IBM says the campaign was uncovered by a security team it set up at the start of the pandemic to track down Covid-19 cyber-threats.  ""The precision targeting and nature of the specific targeted organisations potentially point to nation-state activity,"" the US company said.  ""Without a clear path to a [pay]out, cyber-criminals are unlikely to devote the time and resources required to execute such a calculated operation."" Intelligence gathering IBM says it has notified those targeted as well as law-enforcement authorities. The US's  Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (Cisa) has issued an alert  encouraging organisations associated with the storage and transport of a vaccine  to be on guard for the kind of attacks linked to IBM's report . In July, the UK warned Russian intelligence had targeted UK vaccine research, including at Oxford.  The US also warned of Chinese hacking, while, more recently, Microsoft said it had seen North Korean and Russian hackers targeting vaccine research.  Officials suggested the activity so far had been about intelligence gathering rather than disruption of any research.

Fraudulent emails convinced staff at MacEwan University that one of its clients was changing its bank account details. Staff then paid money into the fraudulently created account. The university, in Edmonton, Alberta, is auditing its business practices. Police have traced most of the funds to accounts in Hong Kong and Montreal, but no charges have been laid. The scam came to light when the real client complained of non-payment. ""There is never a good time for something like this to happen,"" university spokesperson David Beharry said in a statement. ""As our students come back to start the new academic year, we want to assure them and the community that our IT systems were not compromised during this incident."" What is phishing? Phishing is a common type of internet fraud where scammers send emails that appear to be from a reputable company, enticing people to give up personal information. Mr Beharry also said the university was working to ensure that this fraud would not impact future educational or business operations. An internal review is expected to make recommendations on ways the school can prevent this from happening again. A preliminary audit found that protocols around changing banking information were ""inadequate"" and staff missed a number of opportunities to identify the fraud.

The study by Google and UC Berkeley  looked at the ways email and other accounts get hijacked.  It used 12 months of log-in and account data found on websites and criminal forums or which had been harvested by hacking tools. Google said the research helped secure accounts by showing how people fell victim to scammers and hackers. During the 12 months studying the underground markets, the researchers identified more than 788,000 credentials stolen via keyloggers, 12 million grabbed via phishing and 1.9 billion from breaches at other companies. Phishing involves attempts to trick people into handing over personal information and keyloggers are programs that record every key someone presses when using a computer. Physical location The most useful information for cyber-thieves came from keyloggers and phishing attacks as these included valid passwords in 12%-25% of attacks, it found. Phishing attacks posed the biggest risk to users  as these helped malicious hackers scoop up about 234,000 valid names and passwords every week. By contrast, keyloggers only yielded about 15,000 valid credentials each week. Cyber-attackers also sought to grab other information that could be useful in attacks, said the researchers.  Data about a person's internet address (IP) as well as the device they were using and their physical location were all potentially useful for attackers seeking to defeat security checks. Popular passwords found in data breaches 123456 password 123456789 abc123 password1 111111 qwerty 12345678 1234567 Gathering this data was much harder, found the research, with only 3.8% of people who had credentials leaked also giving away IP addresses and fewer than 0.001% surrendering detailed device information. In a blog, Google said it would use the results of the research to refine the ways it spotted and blocked attempts to take over accounts. In particular it would enhance efforts to use historical data about where users logged in and the devices they used to thwart impersonation attacks. The company has  a range of resources  for people affected or looking to protect themselves. However, the researchers acknowledged that the ""multi-pronged problem"" of account hijacking required efforts in lots of different areas. It noted that only 3.1% of people who had an account hijacked subsequently started using improved security measures, such as two-factor authentication, after they regained control of a lost account. Because of this, they said, educating users about better ways to protect accounts should become a ""major initiative"".

The list of potential targets includes recent MPs. The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), which is part of GCHQ, disclosed the request in a document released early on 16 May.  The BBC understands that the number of victims is currently understood to be in single figures. Candidates have been asked to look for suspicious emails received after Jan 2017. The NCSC declined to say if any data had been taken. A report in the Financial Times  said it was ""likely"" that the phishing campaign had been orchestrated by a state. In a document titled Phishing: guidance for political parties and their staff, the centre says it has ""become aware of phishing attacks to gain access to the online accounts of individuals that were MPs before dissolution of Parliament"" and ""other staff who work in political parties"". media caption Technology explained: What is phishing? The NCSC said the attacks were likely to continue ""and may be sent to parliamentary email addresses, prospective parliamentary candidates, and party staff"". 'Personal emails targeted' The BBC understands that so far victims' personal emails have been affected but no successful phishing attempts have been made via parliamentary email addresses. It is believed that the NCSC has contacted the Electoral Commission about the threat and that the commission will help to alert candidates. The centre said that potential victims should look out for ""unexpected requests to reset your password for online or social media accounts (such as Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook or Twitter)"".  ""Or you might have been asked to approve changes to your account that you've not requested."" The NCSC did not say whether it knew who was behind the phishing campaign.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Concern about phishing attempts has been on the rise lately Analysis by Gordon Corera, security correspondent, BBC News The warnings to political parties come as cyber-security officials brace themselves for some kind of incident during the elections.  No-one can be sure that anything will take place, but the experience of the US and more recently France has led them to believe that some kind of theft and then dump of information is possible.  In both those cases, a Russian hand is suspected. Intelligence agencies have historically kept their distance from the communication of politicians due to the doctrine that says MPs should not be monitored.  But parties and politicians themselves have been asking for advice and guidance in recent months amid growing concerns. Concern about elections being targeted by hackers has been running high, following the attack on the Democratic National Committee during the US presidential election. US authorities attributed that incident to Russia and said that a significant component of the attack involved phishing.  More recently, the electoral campaign of President Emmanuel Macron in France was targeted by a similar campaign. The NCSC has said the UK has ""systems in place to defend against electoral fraud at all levels and [we] have seen no successful cyber-intervention in UK democratic processes"". The BBC understands that since last month, the NCSC has delivered cyber-security seminars to the UK's political parties, with the aim of helping them reduce the risk of succumbing to an attack. Advice has also been offered to local authorities and the electoral commission.

A report  on the first year of the GCHQ unit's cyber-defence programme found that it removed 121,479 phishing sites hosted in the UK. This reduced the UK's share of global phishing attacks from 5.3% to 3.1%. Three-quarters of UK government-related phishing sites were taken down in 24 hours. Phishing emails trick users into visiting websites that impersonate known brands and ask the user to log in to their account. This enables attackers  to gather confidential login details or financial information .  Phishing emails are also used to trick people into opening malicious email attachments that install malware on their computers. The methods of reducing phishing involved using various security scanning systems to perform millions of tests on government websites and emails being sent in and out of government networks. 'Simple things' ""What they've done is not rocket science - the technology's been around for a while, but they've managed to persuade various government departments to do the simple things to reduce cyber-security threats dramatically,"" cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward, from Surrey University, told the BBC. ""Phishing emails from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) used to be the most common emails you'd see, but they got the HMRC to put the technology in place, and the spoofing emails dropped to zero in a matter of days."" Cyber-security expert Graham Cluley said that technologies used were not new, but the NCSC's efforts had produced ""impressive results"". ""Of course they won't have caught every phishing attempt, but they will have helped stamp out many of the most convincing attacks,"" he told the BBC.  Martyn Thomas, Gresham College's professor of IT, agreed: ""I think their success rate on stopping really legitimate-looking spam is really high and they are to be congratulated."" While Prof Thomas felt that the NCSC would benefit from having a ""longer-term vision"" when it came to cybersecurity, he felt the fact that the government agency could gain intelligence from GCHQ on potential cyber-attacks gave it an edge over commercial cybersecurity contractors.  NHS targeted Prof Woodward said the NCSC's work was ""an important development"" because the organisation was able to close down the opportunity for people to pretend to be from within the NHS, which would help to prevent future attacks. ""The biggest problem is people pretending to be within,"" he said. ""Whenever you receive something that seems to come from your own network, you inherently trust it.""

""Hey babe,"" it began. The friend asked Zed to vote for her in an online modelling competition, which she agreed to do.  But then - disaster. Adding her email address to the competition register had caused a tech meltdown, her friend said. She needed to borrow her email log-in to fix it quickly and restore her votes.  Zed was unsure. The friend begged - her career was at stake, she pleaded. Still in the meeting and powerless to make a call, Zed gave in - a momentary leap of faith. Except it was not her friend that she was talking to - someone else had got into the account and was pretending to be her.  It's a scamming technique known as spear phishing. image copyright Getty Images What is spear phishing? ""Phishing uses behavioural psychology to trick victims into trusting the attacker in order to obtain sensitive information,"" said Paul Bischoff of  Comparitech , who also talked to Zed.  ""Spear phishing is less prevalent, but far more dangerous. Spear phishing targets an individual or small group of people. The attacker can gather personal information about their target to build a more believable persona."" How do I protect myself? Besides never sharing the credentials for your online accounts, a good way to stay safe is to enable ""two-step authentication"". This means that users must enter another code besides their password, received for example by their mobile phone, to log in. This can usually be set up in the security settings for your account or during the sign-up process. Two-step authentication is offered by Gmail, Hotmail, Apple, Amazon, Yahoo, Facebook and Twitter  among others . Within minutes, Zed watched in horror as she was locked out of one account after another, as well as her Apple iCloud where she stored all her data - including a photo of her passport, bank details, and some explicit pictures. The hacker took control of all her IDs as they were all linked to the email address details she had supplied.  The scammer also activated an extra layer of security, called two-step authentication, meaning that they received all alerts about her accounts and could reset them. Then a man called. The number had a Pakistan area code.  ""He started the call by saying he didn't want any drama, he didn't want me to cry, he wanted me to talk to him like a professional,"" she said. He sounded young, perhaps a college student, she thought. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning 'Immoral' He accused her of leading an ""immoral"" life. He had seen her photographs, he knew she had smoked and had boyfriends and was sexually active.  He asked her what her parents would think and was furious when she said they already knew. ""He claimed he had hacked thousands of women,"" Zed says. ""He said 10 or 12 he had felt bad about because he couldn't find anything about them that was 'wrong'."" Zed was not part of that group. ""He said he was happy when he hacked my account. That I deserved everything."" He told her he would post the explicit pictures on her Facebook page - where she has more than 1,000 friends. image copyright Getty Images image caption The scammer said he had targeted thousands of people. ""I offered him money. I asked if I could pay. He said, 'Don't talk about money.' He sounded irritated,"" she said. Instead, he wanted her to perform a sex act for him on camera.  Zed refused. ""Either you do it for me or you do it for the whole world,"" he told her - and uploaded one of the photos to Facebook.  Zed had already warned her boyfriend and parents who assembled an army of friends waiting to report activity on her account. Within 15 minutes it had been disabled by Facebook - but she still received concerned messages from contacts. ""A friend who is like a brother sent me a message - it wasn't him who had seen [the photo] but a friend of his,"" she said. ""I feel like I mustn't think too much about how many people saw [the photos]."" The last thing the scammer said to her was, ""Have a great life."" ""It seemed to me the only reason he was doing this was to morally police women and get them to do stuff for him,"" Zed said. image copyright Comstock image caption The man didn't want money ""He wanted a gallery of explicit photographs of women. That seemed to be his motive."" Zed does not consider herself to be digitally naive. She is a bright, articulate 20-something from India who works in the media industry on the US east coast. ""I have been tech savvy and on the internet almost my entire life - but I've never really seen the power of what people can do until now,"" she says.  Regaining control of her accounts has been a struggle. It took Zed a month to get her Apple ID back after engineers created a bespoke questionnaire for her containing answers that were not stored in her account. Gmail and Facebook have also been restored, but she has lost Snapchat and her Hotmail address - her central account which she had used for more than 13 years.  'Chink in the armour' ""I feel for the poor woman - these scams are so easy to fall for,"" said cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward from Surrey University. ""I think what it shows is that security is a combination of people, process and technology.  You can be very 'savvy' in any one or two of these but scammers are superb at finding novel combinations that, frankly, we just wouldn't think of.  ""I know it sounds so obvious but, regardless of who they are, you should not share your username and password.  Give these scammers a small chink in the armour and they are sadly brilliant at getting in and running amok in your digital life."" Zed still uses iCloud but does not store personal stuff on it anymore - and has activated two-step verification everywhere.   ""I still see the value in the storage. But I will never ever give any information away again,"" she said. Zed originally decided to share her story on community site Reddit after trying to find others who may have been conned by the same man. ""I was really shocked to discover that I found absolutely nothing,"" she said. ""I was hoping that speaking up about it would remedy that problem and encourage others to share their stories. ""It also felt like the only way to get back at him."" As far as Zed knows, the scammer has not been caught. ""Cyber-criminals come in all shapes and sizes,' said prof Woodward.  ""Their motive is not always monetary gain. As we have sadly seen of late, revenge or just being plain malicious is a growing trend.""

About 2,500 state employees received the email, according to the state chief information security officer. Around the world, people have reported getting multiple copies of the email, while others have received the message from trusted organisations. One million Gmail users, which Google says is ""fewer than 0.1%"", were affected. The cost to the Minnesota state government was mainly the result of employees dealing with the attack rather than carrying out their normal jobs, said state chief information security officer Christopher Buse. ""I estimated three minutes of time per employeeâ¦ it may be much more than that in many cases,""  he told ABC News . ""It's important for people to understand not only that the attacks are happening but also to understand how costly they are."" Mr Buse said that the cost could have been much higher but Minnesota state government agencies generally did not use Gmail or Google Docs. ""Most of these scams are done using Office documents like Word and Excel spreadsheets"", Ken Munro, of Pen Test Partners, told the BBC. ""But a lot of big companies have moved away from traditional office software packages, and an increasing number are moving towards using Google.""

If they clicked on the ""Open in Docs"" button, they were taken to a genuine Google page that required them to log in with their account credentials. Once logged in, a service called ""Google Apps"" would ask them for permission to access their email account data. By agreeing to share their data, users were potentially giving the hackers access to their email account, contacts and online documents. The malware used this access to send copies of the phishing email to everyone in the recipient's contacts list. ""As companies get better at security, scammers will start looking for connections between personal email accounts and professional accounts, which might sidestep some of the company's security,"" Mr Munro said. He said that introducing ""layers of separation"" - such as not checking personal email on the office computer - could help prevent such phishing campaigns spreading. ""Companies could say they might not want you to check personal email on your work computer, but they don't mind you checking it on your mobile."" image copyright Twitter / Laura White Google said it had stopped the attack ""within approximately one hour"" and fewer than 0.1% of its users had been affected - about one million people.

'Too widespread'  According to  PC World  magazine, the scam was more sophisticated than typical phishing attacks, whereby people trick people into handing over their personal information by posing as a reputable company.  This is because the hackers bypassed the need to steal people's login credentials and instead built a third-party app that used Google processes to gain account access. The Russian hacking group Fancy Bear has been accused of using similar attack methods, but one security expert doubted their involvement.  ""I don't believe they are behind this... because this is way too widespread,"" Jaime Blasco, chief scientist at security provider AlienVault, told PC World.  Google said the spam campaign affected ""fewer than 0.1%"" of Gmail users. That works out to about one million people affected. Last year, an American man  pleaded guilty  to stealing celebrities' nude pictures by using a phishing scam to hack their iCloud and Gmail accounts. And in 2013, Google said it had detected thousands of phishing attacks targeting email accounts of Iranian users  ahead of the country's presidential election .

The personal finance site Money Saving Expert says it is aware of students at major universities being targeted in a new wave of "" phishing  emails"".  At Queen Mary University London, one student was tricked out of Â£300.  University of Glasgow said it was also aware of the scam and had advised students to ignore the email.  Fake grants The mother of the QMUL student said her daughter had received the scam email last week.  It looked as if it had come from the university's finance department, complete with the logo, and invited the young woman to claim a government bursary.  An online form asked her for personal and banking details and took her to a bank verification page, which was when she became suspicious.  But, MSE says, the student found the fraudsters had already taken Â£300 from her bank account.  In a statement QMUL said: ""We were made aware late last week that a number of QMUL students had received these phishing emails. ""QMUL proactively monitors its systems to prevent and detect breaches, and there is no evidence to suggest any system has been compromised in this instance. ""A message was sent to all students warning them about the scam and providing them with advice on how they can protect themselves online, including details of our cybersecurity training courses."" The university said it did not believe the scam had affected many students and said it was confident its own systems had not been breached.  The University of Glasgow said it would never ask for banking information in this way.  In an email to all students, the university said it had become aware of a scam email headed: ""Educational Grant Information"".  ""This is an email message that appears as if it has come from the University of Glasgow's finance department. It has not,"" the university said.  Earlier this year, the police site Action Fraud warned of a similar ""phishing"" campaign at universities.  image copyright BrianAJackson image caption One student lost Â£300 after falling for the scam The Student Loans Company said students were particularly vulnerable to ""phishing"" attempts around the main payment dates, in September, January and April.

The online crime groups were shunning mobiles and newer technologies in favour of phishing campaigns, said the report from Verizon.  The annual analysis catalogues more than 100,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2015. Almost 90% of the incidents involved attempts to steal cash, it said. The gangs were sticking to booby-trapped emails because they were proving increasingly effective, said Marc Spitler, lead author on the report. And, so far, there was little evidence novel technologies involving net-connected gadgets or smartphones were becoming a popular attack route. About 30% of phishing emails had been opened by people in targeted organisations in 2015, said the report, up from 23% in 2014.  And, of the scam emails opened, about 13% had been able to launch malware because staff had run the attachments they had carried. This meant, said Mr Spitler, it often took just minutes for criminals to compromise the network of a targeted company. ""If an attack works, then it works very quickly,"" he said.  ""The phishing email typically leads to the installation of malware or the compromise of a user's PC by some sort of malicious code that can establish control or persistence on a network,"" said Mr Spitler.  Unfortunately, he added, although companies fell victim quickly, they could take far longer to notice they had been breached.  Statistics gathered for the Verizon report suggest 84% of the organisations questioned took weeks to spot that criminals had won access to internal systems.

On Tech Tent we assess the damage done by what may be the most successful act of cyber-espionage yet seen. Listen  to the latest  Tech Tent  podcast on BBC Sounds Listen live every Friday at 15.00 GMT on the BBC World Service It was last Sunday when it emerged that a company called SolarWinds had been hacked and its customers were being advised to disconnect from one of its key products, the Orion Platform, used to monitor networks. I'm sure many people yawned and thought this was just another hack but to cyber-security experts the name of the company targeted was a red flag. ""The moment I heard SolarWinds was involved, the alarm bells went off,"" Rick Holland, chief information security officer at Digital Shadows, tells Tech Tent. That was because customers of SolarWinds network monitoring tools include many branches of the US government. ""You have the highest tiers of both the military side of the government, as well as the civilian agencies in the government, as well."" Through the week it seemed each day brought news of another key agency whose defences had been breached since the attackers tampered with an update to the SolarWinds Orion platform.  The Departments of Treasury and Commerce were named first, then Homeland Security, the National Institute of Health and even the Los Alamos nuclear weapons lab were said to have been compromised. image copyright Reuters image caption The FBI is among those investigating the hacking campaign At an early stage Reuters news agency said three sources had told it Russia was behind the attack - an allegation the Russian Foreign Ministry described as baseless.  The US government has been cautious about attributing the attack to the Russians, although the FBI has said it is investigating ""in order to attribute, pursue, and disrupt the responsible threat actors"". In the New York Times  on Thursday President Trump's former homeland security adviser, Tom Bossert, was clear about who he thinks is responsible. ""The magnitude of this ongoing attack is hard to overstate,"" he wrote. ""The Russians have had access to a considerable number of important and sensitive networks for six to nine months.""  But whoever did it, how did they manage to get through the defences of a company like SolarWinds with what the company describes as a "" very sophisticated supply-chain attack""?  Rick Holland has a theory: ""We do know that SolarWinds, in their filing to the Security and Exchange Commission this week, alluded to Microsoft, which makes me think that the initial access into the SolarWinds environment was through a phishing email. So someone clicked on something they thought was benign -  turned out it was not benign."" If it did all start with a phishing email, that won't sound too sophisticated to many people.  But in a blog post , calling for a global response to what he describes as a moment of reckoning, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, says his own company's investigations confirm that this was an attack ""remarkable for its scope, sophistication and impact"". image copyright Reuters image caption President Trump has yet to comment on the hack which security experts see as hugely significant While not attributing the attack to Russia in so many words, he notes the country's involvement in previous hacks and calls this latest one ""an act of recklessness that created a serious technological vulnerability for the United States and the world"". Much of the language used about this attack by both American government officials and private companies sounds like that used during periods of tension during the Cold War. But so far, the man who leads the United States has been silent. President Trump was swift in sacking US cyber-security chief Chris Krebs after he described the November election as the most secure in American history. But he has not said a word about what looks like the modern equivalent of an armed raid on the United States mainland by a foreign power.

Members of the  BBC Radio 4's You and Yours  team were among those who received the scam emails, claiming they owed hundreds of pounds to UK firms. The firms involved have been inundated with phone calls from worried members of the public. One security expert warned clicking on the link would install malware. You and Yours reporter Shari Vahl was one of the first on the team to receive an email. ""The email has good spelling and grammar and my exact home address...when I say exact I mean, not the way my address is written by those autofill sections on web pages, but the way I write my address.

Compiled by Verizon, the report looks at analyses of almost 80,000 security incidents that hit thousands of companies in 2014. It found that, in many companies, about 25% of those who received a phishing email were likely to open it. ""Training your employees is a critical element of combating this threat,"" said Bob Rudis, lead author on the report. Threat spotting Tricking people into opening a booby-trapped message let attackers grab login credentials that could be used to trespass on a network and steal data, the report said. ""They do not have to use complex software exploits, because often they can get hold of legitimate credentials,"" Mr Rudis said. Analysis of data breaches found that, in many cases, it had taken less than two minutes for freshly sent phishing emails to catch their first victim. And, said Mr Rudis, half of the victims had clicked on the message within the first hour of it being sent. Although attackers racked up victims quickly, it took companies far longer to notice they had been compromised, Mr Rudis said. The report also found companies could take straight-forward steps to defend themselves against well-crafted phishing emails designed to make people open them and their attachments.  Teaching staff to spot bogus messages could reduce the proportion of victims to sent emails from one in four to one in 20, he said.  Showing workers the tell-tale signs of a phishing email could also turn them into another line of defence that could catch messages missed by automatic detection systems. ""They should be treating employees as tools in the fight rather than as lambs to the slaughter,"" Mr Rudis said. After phishing, some cyber-thieves relied on companies running un-patched software that was vulnerable to old and well-known exploits, he said.  More than 99% of the vulnerabilities exploited in data breaches had been known about for more than a year, Mr Rudis said. And some had been around for a decade. ""There are some vulnerabilities that just linger out there,"" he said. A good patching regime would help companies protect themselves against most of the vulnerabilities cyber-thieves abuse, Mr Rudis added.

Enthusiasts will tell you it's the future of money - but investing in the notoriously volatile virtual currency can be a rollercoaster, and it's not without risk. The hunt for new coins, using powerful computers, is also  causing a surge in energy demand  - which is not so good for the environment. Here are some of your Bitcoin adventures. 'It paid for a holiday in Iceland' James Saye, tech consultant  image copyright James Saye I first invested in Bitcoin in 2017 - I was nervous about putting too much in, so I went for around Â£500. I cashed it in for Â£2,500 during one of its peaks, and had a great holiday in Iceland - the cash came in handy, Iceland is lovely but expensive. I bought in again in 2018 when the price was lower so I'm still in but I don't regret cashing out when I did. 'It's part of my pension plan' Heather Delaney, founder of Gallium Ventures image copyright Heather Delaney I've been the silent crypto-investor. I put in Â£5 at the very beginning and I've built it slowly and steadily over time. I see it as a long-term strategy, meaning the rapid highs and lows are not ones that cause me anxiety - although ask me as I near my retirement and we shall see what I think then! Based on how much I have invested in Bitcoin over time versus what I see today, I have a 585.41% increase in my investment.  I've never cashed it out - but I have converted some to other currencies as the market has fluctuated. I know loads of people who have done exciting things with their investments but for me it's part of my pension plan. I know I'm not typical.  'He didn't get a single penny back' David Stubley, founder of 7 Elements cyber-security firm image copyright David Stubley/Getty Images We had a client whose Bitcoin wallet was fraudulently accessed and all the money was transferred out of it. He had intended to use it as a deposit on a house. The man had been spooked by reports of fluctuations in the currency and decided to check his wallet. But he clicked on a fraudulent link, which led him to a phishing site, a complete clone of the real thing. He had 84 bitcoins, and the fraudsters transferred 83 of them. At the time, in 2017, they were worth $475,000. We tracked the payment on the blockchain [a kind of shared digital public ledger] - we could see it rolling across various wallets and finally it reached a wallet containing $15m of currency. While the final identity of the fraudsters could not be identified, we were able to have the wallets frozen, so at least denying access to the stolen funds. Our client was irate but philosophical. Today, that stolen Bitcoin would be worth Â£2.8m. Once it's gone, it really has gone. 'I bought a Bentley'  Javed Khan, independent trader  image copyright Javed Khan My Bitcoin journey didn't start as an investment. At first, it was a form of transferring money, I didn't have to wait for confirmation from banks and so on - it was convenient. In 2018, I noticed I'd make a transfer, leave some Bitcoin in my wallet and I'd see the prices go up - and before I knew it I was seeing profit, which surprised me. I had been telling my friends I was using it as a transfer tool, I hadn't thought about investing in it. In January 2020, I cashed in my Bitcoin profits and bought a Bentley in Dubai, where I now live. I sent a video from the showroom to my mum and she cried, she was really proud. I would only put in money that I could afford to lose. The most I've lost is the transaction fees - when the price drops I don't lose faith.  I think the best time to buy Bitcoin is when nobody's talking about it - wait for the hype to die down. 'My electricity bill was A$600 a month when I was mining Bitcoin' Rohan Muscat, project manager and electrical engineer image copyright Rohan Muscat I became aware of Bitcoin in 2010, but being a bit of a hardware geek, I wanted to mine it. In late 2016 I bought a pair of graphics cards to mine, and at first I did pretty well with it. A start-up I'd done some consulting for gave me some Horizon State tokens (another form of crypto-currency) to pay part of my way, and in January 2017 those plus my mined assets were worth A$40,000 (Â£22,000). I decided to trade it a bit, and investigated bots while moving to bigger scale mining.  At first it paid for itself, but then it went downhill and was borderline break-even. My electricity bill shot up to A$500-A$600 a month, because the mining rig needed so much power. I ended up selling the mining gear, and I'm currently sitting on about A$2,000 in crypto.  I could have made more if I'd jumped in and out, but the emotions and risks in trading have burnt me, and I'd rather not take the risk.  'Bitcoin helped me buy my house' Daniel Crocker, business owner  image copyright Daniel Crocker In 2012, I was doing an apprenticeship at an IT company. At lunchtime we used to chat about little ways of making money on the side. Nobody had really heard of Bitcoin but we decided to give it a go and we spent a few weeks on it.  It didn't last long, but luckily I kept hold of mine.  I traded them in last summer and got half the deposit for my house. I've still got a little bit but I'm just going to sit tight - it's not something I want to pin my future on.  I do know people who have gone in deep but I think I've been lucky enough already.

Icann, which administers the net's addressing system, said spoofed emails were used to reach an internal network. The attackers used this access to steal lists of contact and login information for people who control some of the net's most popular domains. Icann said it had notified people that their data may have gone astray and asked them to change their passwords. Icann, the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, was set up to oversee the underlying addressing system that keeps the net running and ensures data gets where it is supposed to go. In a blogpost , Icann said some of its staff were tricked into opening booby-trapped email messages sent by attackers that were crafted to look like they came from other employees. The attack took place in late November and Icann realised it had been attacked about a week later.  The booby-trapped emails helped the attackers capture login name and password details for Icann's internal network that attackers then used to snoop around the organisation's systems. An investigation by Icann revealed that the attackers got at a system called the Centralised Zone Data System (CZDS) that lists who looks after what is known as generic top-level domains. This includes the widely used .com, .info, .net and .org domains as well as a host of other more recently established domains. Icann said it was not possible to alter any details of who administers these domains from its CZDS system. Passwords were stored in a hard to crack format, said Icann, and added it had deactivated passwords so those with legitimate access to CZDS would have to generate a new one.

Levels of reported crime fell across Wales from October 2019-2020, including in the first few months of the pandemic. But figures show reports of cyber crime, stalking and harassment spiked. Professor Martin Innes said challenges were ""unprecedented"" in modern times. The Cardiff University professor said while it was hard to predict the future, an increase in digital crime during the pandemic, teamed with the economic impact and increases in social tension mixed for a ""worrying cocktail"" for post-lockdown crime. Covid lockdown rule breakers could 'make pandemic longer' Policing Covid in Wales: 'Coughed at and spat on' Police forces across Wales have repeatedly warned of being  under immense pressure  during the pandemic as they try to enforce Covid laws while dealing with serious and violent crime. Recent figures,  released by the Office of National Statistics , show 245,591 crimes were reported to Welsh police forces between October 2019 and September 2020, a 7% fall on the year before, although this does not include fraud figures. The number of fraud offences increased by 8% to 14,845 during the same period. While the number of burglaries (-18%), thefts (-22%) and shoplifting offences fell between September 2019-2020, stalking and harassment reports increased by 11% in Wales, with 36,770 reports. Domestic abuse charities also reported marked  increases in calls for help when schools returned in September  after abuse was not reported during lockdown. Prof Innes, director of the Crime and Security Research Institute at Cardiff University, said crime had been shifting for years, but lockdown had seemed to accelerated rates of personal and digital crime, as people were stuck at home and spending more time online. Dyfed-Powys Police saw the largest increase in reports of stalking and harassment offences, with 5,229 reports a 34% increase compared to the year before. In North Wales police reported an increase in stalking and harassment crimes, as well as a rise in disability and transphobic hate crime. media caption A BBC investigation has found online scams selling fake protective equipment and coronavirus tests While the coronavirus pandemic has seen many acts of kindness, police have warned some criminals have used Covid-19 to scam people out of their life savings. Figures,  published by Action Fraud , show victims of cyber crime and fraud in Wales have reportedly lost Â£35.4m, with almost 13,000 crimes reported since the start of lockdown on 23 March. Health officials and police have warned scammers claiming to work for the NHS are targeting vulnerable people online offering fake Covid vaccines in return for cash or personal details. Dyfed-Powys Police also reported a  significant increase in romance fraud , with victims in west Wales losing Â£1.3m between January and November last year, with officers saying criminals are targeting the lonely in lockdown. image caption Prof Innes said that empty shops could become hot spots for anti-social behaviour when lockdown was eased Prof Innes said the shift to cyber, such as online hate crime, drug dealing over apps, and smear campaigns, was a huge challenge for forces and they would need to invest in expertise and technology to be able to recover evidence. He said the impact of the pandemic on drug trade, and gang operations like County Lines, was concerning, as criminal operations would have changed. ""Just like everybody else has changed their behaviour in the pandemic, those involved in drug behaviour have probably done the same... and probably some of those innovations they've made will stick."" At a recent North Wales Police and Crime panel Chief Constable Carl Foulkes said that officers were predicting an increase in ""digital cyber criminality"" and it would be a ""complex and challenging"" area for the future. media caption ""He would push, shove and kick me out of bed"" South Wales Police and Crime Commissioner Alun Michael warned ""increased levels of serious violence and domestic abuse were likely to continue"" following the pandemic. In a report to the  South Wales Police and Crime Panel, Mr Michael  said: ""The scale of the economic downturn and subsequent rate of recovery will fundamentally shape the post pandemic crime and disorder landscape in the medium to long term."" He added: ""People are spending more time online - increasing the risk of phishing, grooming, cyber attacks and sextortion.  ""Payment preferences are also shifting to increasingly be online which again opens up opportunities for online fraud."" Meanwhile reports of public order offences also increased across all four forces by 8%, with Dyfed-Powys Police recording an increase of 29% during the year to September 2020. In Dyfed-Powys and Gwent Police areas, documents show the forces said crime had increased after lockdown measures were first eased in summer 2020. In  Gwent reports of sexual offences increased by 29%  (from 128 to 126), but remained significantly lower than normal with the force saying less people were reporting the crime, while bike thefts increased by 25%, due to ""cycling being encouraged...during lockdown"". media caption Covid lockdown rule breakers flee Cwmbran salon in police raid In the  Dyfed-Powys area drug offences increased during the first lockdown in March , before decreasing significantly later in 2020. The force warned that public tensions remained high due to Covid restrictions, and this had led to the number of reports of public order offences remaining high. There had been ""exponential"" increases in anti-social behaviour reports due to breaches of lockdown rules, it said. In July and August, when restrictions began to ease, there was a sharp rise in violent attacks, but the force said this was down to an ""increase in alcohol related"" incidents. In North Wales, by the start of December, officers had issued 582 fines for Covid-19 restriction breaches, with two Â£10k fines issued for illegal music events. media caption The impact of Covid rule-breakers Prof Innes said when lockdown measures were eased again, anti-social behaviour and low level public disorder could spike in communities, and with people struggling due to losing their jobs, crime levels would return to pre-pandemic levels. ""People have been cooped up and there won't be an awful lot of things for people to do as the weather gets nicer,"" he said. ""We can already see some of the social tensions kind of bubbling away when you look across Europe. ""Longer term we are going to see a lot of empty shops and town centres are going to be very different than they have been... what we know is when you've got empty stores they act as a magnet for trouble.""

""We see tens of different hacking attacks every single week. It is never ending."" A senior computer network manager for a global financial services company, Peter (who did not want to give his surname, or the name of his employer, due to his firm's anxieties surrounding cyber-security), says they are bombarded from all directions. ""We see everything,"" he says. ""Staff get emails sent to them pretending to be from the service desk, asking them to reset their log-in passwords. ""We see workers being tricked into downloading viruses from hackers demanding ransoms, and we have even had employees sent WhatsApp messages pretending to be from the CEO, asking for money transfers. ""And having staff working from home during the lockdowns has just made it worse, as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone."" image copyright Getty Images image caption If you thought your cyber-security had been compromised, would you know how to contact your IT department? With  one in three UK workers currently based exclusively at home , and the  same level in the US , this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the IT security bosses of companies large and small around the world. And studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should. For example, one in five UK home workers has received no training on cyber-security,  according to a recent survey by legal firm Hayes Connor Solicitors.  The report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first. Meanwhile, a separate UK study last year found that  57% of IT decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach. ""In the rush and panic to set remote working practices up, even simple data protection practices were ignored,"" says Christine Sabino, a senior associate at Hayes Connor. image copyright Hayes Connor image caption Christine Sabino fears that in the haste to set up home working, some firms ignored cyber-security issues ""Companies did not provide additional security relating to computers, electronic communication, phone communication."" So what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible? Ted Harrington, a San Diego-based cyber-security specialist, and author of Hackable: How To Do Application Security Right, says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop. While many larger companies may well have done this, not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so, but Mr Harrington stresses its importance. ""Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned, controlled and configured by the company,"" he says. ""This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right, and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants."" image copyright Ted Harrington image caption Ted Harrington says that workers should not be too scared to report a possible cyber-security breach Definitely don't have staff using their personal computers for work, says Sam Grubb, an Arkansas-based cyber-security consultant, and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works. ""The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it, nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it,"" he says. ""So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free, your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing. ""This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen. This might affect the work you are doing, or in a worst-case scenario, lead to the compromise of co-workers' devices, or other company devices such as servers."" Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a  VPN or virtual private network,  so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firm's servers and everyone else in the company. image copyright Getty Images image caption Should firms give home workers shredders? Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work. ""A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities,"" he says. ""Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers, lions and bears, you drive through the underground tunnel, where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side."" However, even with work laptops, VPNs and the latest cyber-security software systems in place, staff can still make damaging mistakes, such as falling prey to a ""phishing"" email - a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data. Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some  that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid-19, or invited to have the vaccine.  They ask the recipient to clink on the link, which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer. New Tech Economy  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. For this reason, both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cyber-security training. ""Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face,"" says Mr Grubb.  Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit. She says, for example, that employees should avoid talking about work on social media, while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out. image copyright Tsedal Neeley image caption Harvard University's Tsedal Neeley says that staff need to know who to call in the IT department With even the most cyber-security aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake, Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to. ""If an employee falls victim to an attack, make sure that they know a) who to contact, and b) that their outreach is welcome and won't result in termination,"" he says. ""You don't want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes."" Tsedal Neeley, a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working, agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cyber-security problems to. ""Engaging with their firm's IT/cyber-security experts is crucial,"" she says. Peter, the computer network manager, says this engagement should be frequent. ""Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100% confident about, and it does not hurt to ask your IT department. It is better to check than be compromised.""

Members of Match.com, eHarmony, Zoosk, Christian Mingle and many others had received emails seeking to steal login details for the sites,  said Netcraft .  The net monitoring firm said the emails had been sent from other websites, hacked to hide the senders' identity. Stolen data would be used to befriend other users in an attempt to trick them into handing over cash, it said. The phishing campaign against dating sites marked a departure for fraudsters, who typically preferred to target banks, said Paul Mutton, a security analyst at Netcraft who investigated the attacks.  The attacks were ""massive"", he said, adding that in the past week Netcraft had seen more than 100 compromised sites targeting Match.com alone. So far, he said, it was not clear how sites were being compromised to host the scripts. Websites and servers run by individuals, small businesses, construction firms and telecom suppliers had all become unwitting hosts of the phishing tools, he added. Mr Mutton said just one compromised site he had seen was home to about 800 short programs or scripts that targeted many different dating sites. Each script looked like it had been generated by a ""kit"" bought online. ""Anyone with a very basic knowledge of programming could make use of the kit,"" he said.  Extract cash  The scripts are used to craft phishing emails that are spammed out to potential victims.  The mails seek to trick people into entering their login names for the dating sites.  If successful, the details are passed on to the legitimate login page of a dating website and are also sent to one of 300 email addresses used by the phishing gang.  Fraudsters were keen to steal login details for accounts so they could avoid paying the charges dating sites levied before users could swap messages with other members, said Mr Mutton. Using on-site messages the fraudsters hope to befriend others and then try to extract cash to help pay for a non-existent medical condition or to aid fictitious relatives.  Significant amounts of cash could be stolen this way, said Mr Mutton, pointing to the case of Karen and Tracy Vasseur, of Colorado, who were jailed in 2013 for stealing more than $1m (Â£590,000) from 374 people using dating-site scams.

This year's event is expected to continue to break records across Asia, as more people stay home and shop online amid the Covid-19 pandemic, while those unable to travel overseas for shopping trips are expected to ""revenge spend"" online.  It represents a huge honeypot for scammers who, over the years, have come up with increasingly innovative ways to trick consumers, from creating fake apps to claims of formaldehyde-soaked clothes. Some shoppers in China have lost tens of thousands of dollars to such ruses. What are Chinese police saying this year? Authorities from several provinces including Anhui, Jiangsu and Sichuan have issued warnings on social media platform Weibo about a ""fake refund"" phone scam. How it works: a person impersonating a customer service officer from an e-commerce site phones the victim to inform him that a recent purchase is either out of stock or damaged, and that as compensation they will give him a refund that is more than the amount that he paid. He then asks the victim for bank account details so that he can ""process the refund"".  Singles Day: 3m people, 4,000 planes and ships China continues to bounce back from virus slump Police say they have already seen many such instances in the past few weeks during pre-Singles Day sales. A woman in Yunnan province recently lost a total of 200,000 yuan ($30,000; Â£22,900) recently after she was tricked into believing that she would be getting a refund on 200 yuan worth of clothes that she bought on e-commerce platform Taobao.  She had transferred money to scammers multiple times after being told that there were problems with their system, and that she had to pay to unfreeze her account.  What other Singles Day scams have taken place before? The ""fake refund"" scam has seen various iterations over the years. In 2018, scammers reportedly posed as customer service officers offering refunds on clothes said to be ruined by excessive formaldehyde. One woman in Wuxi city lost 44,000 yuan ($7,000) this way, after she scanned a QR code sent by a scammer which asked for her bank details.  Last year, the formaldehyde scam was tweaked to trick mothers into believing that the chemical had tainted their orders of baby diapers.  media caption Alibaba Singles Day: Dollars or data? Other scams involve counterfeit shopping apps, which are made to look and function like those by retailers such as Taobao and JD.com. As they look so similar to the real deal, victims are tricked into giving away personal information such as mobile numbers and bank account details.  According to a 2018 report by Chinese online security firm 360 Security Brain, close to 4,000 fake shopping apps were downloaded on more than 300,000 mobile devices in China in November that year.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Some have been scammed by counterfeit shopping apps, made to look like those by retailers such as Taobao There have also been reports of fraud related to cash-on-delivery packages, where confused family members are asked to pay cash upfront when signing for delivered packages to their door.  Why are there so many Singles Day scams?  Singles Day is the world's biggest online shopping event in terms of spending, with much of the revenue generated by Chinese online retail giant Alibaba.  Last year, their gross merchandise value on Singles Day reached more than 210bn yuan (Â£23bn, US$31bn), which is double that of Black Friday and Cyber Monday combined. This year, Alibaba is claiming to have hit 372bn yuan of sales within the first 30 minutes of the event including pre-Singles Day orders. Originally created by the company as a Chinese shopping festival, it's now expanded across the region with other online retailers in countries such as Singapore, Thailand and the Philippines all holding their own versions. image copyright Getty Images image caption Staff sorting out parcels after Singles Day last year in the Chinese city of Jiujiang Also known as Double 11 as it is held annually on 11 Nov,  the shopping festival offers buyers huge discounts on everything from household items and fashion accessories, to cars and even houses. The huge number of transactions during this period presents scammers with ample opportunities, and e-commerce fraudulent activities saw ""significant growth"" during the sales period across Asian countries last year, according to data by cybersecurity firm Kaspersky.  Mr Yeo Siang Tiong, general manager for South East Asia, said victims often fall prey to scams on Singles Day because they get ""caught up in the excitement"" while trying to get the best deals. ""In addition, many of the phishing scams in particular have become quite convincing, making it hard for consumers to differentiate between truth and fiction,"" he said.  What can shoppers do to protect themselves?  Never give away critical personal information such as bank account details over the phone. E-commerce platforms such as Taobao would typically have a customer's bank information already saved in their system, so refunds should be able to be processed automatically.  Fake refund scams also often offer you more than what you paid for, which would rarely happen in a real situation. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.  As for Internet phishing scams, double check web addresses if you are redirected to them from other landing pages, said Kaspersky's Mr Yeo, or try to access deal pages directly through the legitimate website.

People looking for games consoles, bicycles and clothing may be at a higher risk of encountering a scam, according to banking industry research. UK Finance, which represents the finance industry, warned of scams when items were never delivered. The average loss in such cases was Â£720 in the first half of the year. 'Ruthless' The trade body said social media platforms, online marketplaces and auction websites were increasingly being used by criminals to carry out these purchase scams, where a customer pays in advance for goods or services that do not exist and are never received. These payments are taken off the integrated payment platform and are made through a bank transfer instead, and mean people are unlikely to be refunded. More than Â£27m was lost to such fraud in the first half of the year, according to UK Finance figures. It also warned that purchase scams may also involve home improvement and DIY purchases such as patio heaters and sheds, as fraudsters adapted to more people staying at home. Fraud: 'I got the shakes every time I went online' Fraudsters 'caught me in a spider's web' Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance, said: ""As consumer spending has shifted online, criminals have ruthlessly adjusted their approaches to pursue those shopping on the internet.  ""With Black Friday and Christmas approaching, fraudsters are again stepping up their efforts to take advantage of consumers searching for bargains."" UK Finance data shows that 25 to 34-year-olds are most likely to shop online regularly. Lockdown cases Ms Worobec said criminals were also using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses. The first UK-wide lockdown led to reports of rising numbers of scam and fraud attempts. Figures from Barclays suggested fraud attempts in general were up 66% in the first half of the year compared with the previous six months.

The tech giant says the pandemic has led to an explosion of  phishing attacks  in which criminals try to trick users into revealing personal data.   The company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day. Over the past week, almost a fifth were scam emails related to coronavirus. The virus may now be the biggest phishing topic ever, tech firms say. Google's Gmail is used by 1.5 billion people.  image caption One of the scam emails impersonates the World Health Organization Individuals are being sent a huge variety of emails which impersonate authorities, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), in an effort to persuade victims to download software or donate to bogus causes. Cyber-criminals are also attempting to capitalise on government support packages by imitating public institutions. Google claims that its machine-learning tools are able to block more than 99.9% of emails from reaching its users. image caption This scam email targeted businesses on Gmail The growth in coronavirus-themed phishing is being recorded by several cyber-security companies. Barracuda Networks said it had seen a 667% increase in malicious phishing emails during the pandemic. Scammers have been sending fake emails and text messages claiming to be from the UK government, the WHO, the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention and even individual US officials, including President Trump. ""Phishing attacks always share the common trait of inciting or depending on an emotion that causes us to act more hastily or think less about our actions at that moment in time,"" said independent security researcher Scott Helme.  ""The coronavirus pandemic is a highly emotional topic right now and cyber-criminals clearly know this. They're hoping that the typical person might be more inclined to click through links or follow bad instructions if they use this lure."" 'Exploitation' Researchers have also found malicious websites and smartphone applications based on genuine coronavirus resources.  One malicious Android app claims to help track the spread of the virus, but instead infects the phone with  ransomware  and demands payment to restore the device.

The party contacted the FBI and agents are investigating the matter, Chairman Andrew Hitt said in a statement on Thursday. Mr Hitt said the hackers manipulated campaign invoices to steal the funds. In the upcoming presidential election Wisconsin is seen as a key state - one Mr Trump won narrowly in 2016. The party's invoices for vendors were altered so that when they paid the invoices, the money did not go to the vendors, Mr Hitt said. He noted it appeared to have begun as a phishing attempt. A party spokesman said it appeared no data was stolen. The millions were taken from the Wisconsin Republicans' federal account. Mr Hitt said that state officials were warned about such cyberattacks at the party's national convention in August. The volunteer hackers protecting the US election How could the hackers have done this? Analysis by Joe Tidy, BBC cyber-security reporter The information security world is tense right now waiting and watching for cyber attacks that could affect the US election. This type of attack was probably not on many people's lists of expected hacks. It sounds like an almost standard case of something called Business Email Compromise (BEC). Effectively the hackers have either gained access to or spoofed an email address to put themselves between the Wisconsin Republican party HQ and one of their suppliers. The party then transferred the money to the hackers instead of its campaign partner. In many cases of BEC, banks are able to reverse the transaction and return at least some of the money to the victims. The Republican party will be hoping that this is what happens here. The reported hack comes as Mr Trump and Democratic rival Joe Biden are both making a final push this week to secure Wisconsin ahead of the 3 November election.  There have also been hundreds of attempted attacks on the Wisconsin Democratic campaign, a spokeswoman told the Associated Press. The Midwestern state is one of a handful of core battleground states - areas which could realistically go to the Republicans or Democrats - this election season. Candidates will need to win in several states like Wisconsin in order to win the presidency. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? Mr Trump won Wisconsin by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016. Recent polls have consistently shown a tight race, usually with Mr Biden ahead.

They asked teachers at Schoenbar Middle School, for 12 to 13-year-olds, to enter admin names and passwords to accept a false software update, according to reports.  The pupils used those details to access and control classmates' PCs. Classmates then complained that their computers were not responding normally. Associated Press said that at least 18 pupils were involved in the phishing, which gave them control over 300 computers allocated for student use at the school in the Alaskan town of Ketchikan. Those computers have now been seized. ""I don't believe any hardware issues were compromised,"" Casey Robinson, the principal, told community radio station  Ketchikan FM .  He said: ""No software issues were compromised. I don't think there was any personal information compromised. Now that we have all the machines back in our control, nothing new can happen.""

Cyber-criminals are targeting individuals as well as industries, including aerospace, transport, manufacturing, hospitality, healthcare and insurance. Phishing emails written in English, French, Italian, Japanese, and Turkish languages have been found. The BBC has tracked five of the campaigns. 1. Click here for a cure image copyright Proofpoint  image caption Victims looking for a cure face having personal details stolen Researchers at the cyber-security firm Proofpoint first noticed a strange email being sent to customers in February. The message purported to be from a mysterious doctor claiming to have details about a vaccine being covered up by the Chinese and UK governments.  The firm says people who click on the attached document are taken to a spoof webpage designed to harvest login details. It says up to 200,000 of the emails are being sent at a time.  ""We have seen 35-plus consecutive days of malicious coronavirus email campaigns, with many using fear to convince victims to click,"" says Sherrod DeGrippo from the company's threat research and detection team. Proofpoint says three to four variations are launched each day. ""It's obvious these campaigns are returning dividends for cyber-criminals,"" says Ms DeGrippo. The best way to see where a link will take you is to hover your mouse cursor over it to reveal the true web address. If it looks dodgy, don't click.   2. Covid-19 tax refund image copyright Mimecast image caption HM Revenue and Customs is not trying to give you a Covid-19 tax rebate Researchers at cyber-security firm Mimecast flagged this scam a few weeks ago. On the morning they detected it, they saw more than 200 examples in just a few hours.  If a member of the public clicked on ""access your funds now"", it would take them to a fake government webpage, encouraging them to input all their financial and tax information. ""Do not respond to any electronic communication in relation to monies via email,"" says Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at Mimecast. ""And certainly do not click on any links in any related message. This is not how HMRC would advise you of a potential tax refund."" 3. Little measure that saves image copyright Proofpoint image caption The World Health Organization is being impersonated by many hacking campaigns Hackers pretending to represent the World Health Organization (WHO) claim that an attached document details how recipients can prevent the disease's spread. ""This little measure can save you,"" they claim. But Proofpoint says the attachment doesn't contain any useful advice, and instead infects computers with malicious software called AgentTesla Keylogger.  This records every keystroke and sends it to the attackers, a tactic that allows them to monitor their victims' every move online. To avoid this scam, be wary of emails claiming to be from WHO, as they are probably fake. Instead visit its official website or social media channels for the latest advice. 4. The virus is now airborne image copyright Cofense image caption Hackers are using fear-mongering tactics to encourge clicks and downloads The subject line reads: Covid-19 - now airborne, increased community transmission.  It is designed to look like it's from the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It uses one of the organisation's legitimate email addresses, but has in fact been sent via a spoofing tool. Cofense, the cyber-defence provider, first detected the scam and describes it as an example of hackers ""weaponising fear and panic"".  It says the link directs victims to a fake Microsoft login page, where people are encouraged to enter their email and password. Then victims are redirected to the real CDC advice page, making it seem even more authentic.  Of course, the hackers now have control of the email account. Cofense says the combination of a ""rather good forgery"" and a ""high stress situation"" make for a potent trap. One way to protect yourself is to enable two-factor authentication, so that you have to enter a code texted or otherwise provided to you, to access your email account. 5. Donate here to help the fight  image copyright Kaspersky image caption The CDC is not asking for donations in Bitcoin This example was reported to malware experts Kaspersky. The fake CDC email asks for donations to develop a vaccine, and requests payments be made in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.  The premise is of course ridiculous, but the email address and signature look convincing. Overall, Kaspersky says it has detected more 513 different files with coronavirus in their title, which contain malware.  ""We expect the numbers to grow, of course, as the real virus continues to spread,"" says David Emm, principal security researcher at the firm.

Students on government loan schemes were targeted and tricked into revealing their bank account details, police said. Some Â£1,000 to Â£5,000 was taken at a time, Scotland Yard said. Victims received emails inviting them to update details on their student account via a link to a bogus website. The Metropolitan Police's e-Crime unit was first alerted in August 2011 and worked with the Student Loans Company, the banking industry and internet service providers during their investigation. Officers have now seized computers and other equipment from addresses in London, Manchester and Bolton. A 26-year-old man and a 25-year-old woman have been arrested in Manchester, while a 25-year-old man was arrested in Deptford, south London. A 49-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were also arrested in Stratford, north-east London, and a 38-year-old man was arrested in Bolton, Lancashire. Phishing is when a legitimate-looking email is sent in an attempt to gather personal and financial information from recipients.

Security firm RSA revealed how attackers assigned targets with a unique ID, meaning the scam could be aimed at specific people. If a person's ID was not on the list, their computer would not be affected. RSA said the advanced threat posed a new ""detection challenge"" to the security industry. In a blog post , RSA cybercrime specialist Limor Kessem wrote: ""As we adapt and improve our detection systems, we are reminded that in the never-ending cat-and-mouse game, only the nimble will survive."" The so-called Bouncer Phishing Kit targets preset lists of email addresses. For each target, a unique ID is automatically generated, creating a unique web address for the user to click on. If someone has an ID that does not match the list of intended targets, they will simply be presented with a 404 Error page, and will be unharmed. If, however, a person is one of the unfortunate ones, the same page will instead spring into life as an ""attack page"" ready to steal user credentials. Using this method means attackers can harvest data from certain groups of users, rather than having to sift through large amounts of data. For example, the Bouncer Phishing Kit could be used to gather personal details on people in one particular country. ""It holds this [bouncer] moniker because much like many high-profile night-time hotspots - if your name is not on the list, you're staying out,"" Mr Kessem said. ""Traditional phishers like to cast as wide of a net as possible. ""But with this tactic the phisher is laser-focusing the campaign in an effort to collect only the most pertinent credentials for his purposes. ""Keeping out uninvited guests also means avoiding security companies and prompt take-downs of such attacks."" Phishing is a growing problem for internet users. According to RSA's data, attacks of this type were up 59% in 2012 compared with the previous year, and cost the global economy $1.5bn (Â£940m).

In an online statement, the firm said it had noticed a ""significant jump"" in the region's overall volume of phishing activity in the last three weeks. The timing and targets suggested the attacks were ""politically motivated"". Friday's poll is the first since 2009 when President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad won a controversial second term. The election had triggered angry protests, with voters accusing Mr Ahmadinejad's camp of rigging the results in his favour. Fake sign-in page Google's vice-president of security engineering, Eric Grosse, said the phishing attacks originated from within Iran. Phishing attempts to obtain passwords and other private computing information by directing users to fake websites. ""For almost three weeks, we have detected and disrupted multiple email-based phishing campaigns aimed at compromising the accounts owned by tens of thousands of Iranian users,"" he said. ""The timing and targeting of the campaigns suggest that the attacks are politically motivated in connection with the Iranian presidential election on Friday."" Mr Grosse said victims targeted in the attacks had received an email containing a link to a web page purporting to perform account maintenance. If they clicked the link, they were taken to a fake Google sign-in page, which would steal their username and password. The threat was detected by a phishing detection feature added to the firm's Chrome web browser in 2012. Mr Grosse warned Iranian users to take extra measures to protect their accounts from ""state-sponsored attacks"". In the latest case, users received a message which appeared to come from Google itself using the official-looking address: email.settings@gmail.com. It suggested they assign an extra email address to their existing Google account to make password recovery easier. The bogus link they were asked to click also contained the search firm's name adding to the appearance of authenticity, Google says. However, the attempt was spotted by a Safe Browsing feature added to Google's Chrome browser last year. Most of the six candidates in Friday's election are conservatives close to Ayatollah Khamenei. The opposition says more than 80 of its supporters were killed in a crackdown over a period of six months after the 2009 election - a figure the government disputes. Several have been sentenced to death, and dozens jailed. The two reformist candidates from 2009 - Mir Hossein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi - remain under house arrest."

It said email addresses and travel details had been stolen and that 2,208 customers had also had their credit and debit card details ""accessed"". The firm has informed the UK's Information Commissioner's Office while it investigates the breach. EasyJet first became aware of the attack in January. It told the BBC that it was only able to notify customers whose credit card details were stolen in early April. ""This was a highly sophisticated attacker. It took time to understand the scope of the attack and to identify who had been impacted,"" the airline told the BBC. ""We could only inform people once the investigation had progressed enough that we were able to identify whether any individuals have been affected, then who had been impacted and what information had been accessed."" Stolen credit card data included the three digital security code - known as the CVV number - on the back of the card itself. EasyJet added that it had gone public now in order to warn the nine million customers whose email addresses had been stolen to be wary of phishing attacks.  It said that it would notify everyone affected by 26 May. It did not provide details about the nature of the attack or the motives, but said its investigation suggested hackers were targeting ""company intellectual property"" rather than information that could be used in identity theft. ""There is no evidence that any personal information of any nature has been misused, however, on the recommendation of the ICO, we are communicating with the approximately nine million customers whose travel details were accessed to advise them of protective steps to minimise any risk of potential phishing. ""We are advising customers to be cautious of any communications purporting to come from EasyJet or EasyJet Holidays."" In response to the breach, the ICO  said that it was investigating. ""People have a right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we will investigate and take robust action where necessary."" It also warned people to be on the lookout for phishing attacks and directed them to its  advice on its website  on how to spot such scams. Phishing  Phishing attempts - which see criminals sending emails with links to fake web pages that steal personal data - have risen exponentially during the coronavirus crisis.  Google is  blocking more than 100 million phishing emails every day  to Gmail users. It is likely that hackers will take advantage of the fact people are cancelling flights because of the uncertainty related to the spread of Covid-19, said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. ""Anybody who has ever purchased an EasyJet flight is advised to be extremely wary when opening emails from now on,"" he said. ""Phishing emails that leverage data stolen during the attack could be used as an attack vector at any point in the future.  ""As a result, it is important for customers to be vigilant whenever they receive unsolicited emails or emails that appear to be from EasyJet, as these could be fake emails which link to cloned websites designed to steal your data."" 'Turbulent times' The coronavirus pandemic has meant an end to much global travel, leaving airlines struggling financially. ""These are already turbulent times for all companies within the aviation industry but the situation has just got significantly worse for EasyJet,"" said Mike Fenton, chief executive of threat detection firm Redscan. ""To add to the company's woes, it is now has to explain how the personal records of nine million customers were able to be accessed. ""When it comes to cyber security, the airline industry doesn't have a great record.  The British Airways breach in 2018  should have been a wake-up call and passenger confidence is likely to be at an all-time low after this."" image copyright Getty Images image caption British Airways was fined a record Â£183m over a large data breach in 2018 British Airways announced that the personal details of more than half a million of its customers had been harvested by hackers in September 2018.  Initially it said that only 380,000 transactions were affected and that the data did not include travel or passport details. The ICO later issued a record Â£183m fine over the breach. Compensation pay-outs to customers could see that reach Â£3bn. Under GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), if EasyJet is found to have mishandled customer data, it could face fines of up to 4% of its annual worldwide turnover. ""It is impossible to determine yet whether or not there has been negligence but, if so, consumers could be eligible to claim compensation, raising the financial penalty imposed on the airline significantly,"" said Aman Johal from law firm Your Lawyers. Millions of EasyJet customers' details of some sort or another have been accessed by hackers - but even more people now need to be vigilant. Generally, personal details can be used by fraudsters to access bank accounts, open accounts and take out loans in the innocent victims' names, make fraudulent purchases, or sell on to other criminals. The risks to those whose card details have been compromised are clear. Their provider should already have stopped the card, a new one will be issued, and they will need to sort out any regular payments coming from that card. Following a similar data breach at British Airways in 2018, some found this a frustrating and time-consuming task. Millions of people whose email addresses and travel details have been accessed will need to change passwords, and be wary of any unexpected transactions. Everyone else, particularly EasyJet customers whose details have not been affected, must be alert to other unsolicited emails and messages.  Fraudsters will no doubt pose as EasyJet, banks, or the authorities and claim to be dealing with this latest breach. They are simply trying to steal personal details themselves.

The website that was put in place by hackers asked users to enter their Apple IDs - the credentials needed to access services like Apple's iTunes. A second screen then asked users to enter further personal information, including credit card details. EA said the problem had been found and hacking attempts had been stopped. Paul Mutton, from Netcraft, the internet security company that uncovered the hack,  said in a blog  that it was likely a vulnerability in an online calendar application hosted on the web server had been exploited by the attackers. The calendar based on the web server was an old version of software that had since been updated, he said. ""The mere presence of old software can often provide sufficient incentive for a hacker to target one system over another, and to spend more time looking for additional vulnerabilities,"" he wrote. Once a user has entered their Apple ID and password on the fake website they are then asked to verify their name, date of birth, phone number and credit card details among other information. Users were then directed to the legitimate Apple ID website, said Mr Mutton. image copyright Netcraft image caption Users are asked to enter their Apple IDs on the fake website It was reported earlier in the year that other servers belonging to EA had been hacked, causing problems for users trying to log on to online games and services. A hacking group known as Derp posted a tweet claiming responsibility for that attack. Mr Mutton said he had reported the most recent problems to Electronic Arts. In a statement to the BBC, EA said: ""We found it, we have isolated it, and we are making sure such attempts are no longer possible."" Michael Sutton, from security research firm Zscaler, said that hackers using legitimate websites to host malicious content was now the norm.  ""Social engineering attacks always involve an element of communication - the victim must be tricked into performing an action such as providing data, clicking on a link, downloading a file, et cetera. Attackers have learned that it's far easier to simply infect an already popular web property than to attempt communication with victims directly,"" he said. Users should check that websites are secure before entering any private information,  says guidance from Get Safe Online. They should look for a padlock symbol in the browser window frame and they should check that the web address begins with https - the ""s"" stands for secure. The advice also says that users should check the address in the browser's address bar after arriving at a website to check that it matches what they actually typed.

The UK's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) said the hackers ""almost certainly"" operated as ""part of Russian intelligence services"". It did not specify which organisations had been targeted, or whether any information had been stolen. But it said vaccine research had not been hindered by the hackers. Russia has denied responsibility. ""We do not have information about who may have hacked into pharmaceutical companies and research centres in Great Britain. We can say one thing - Russia has nothing at all to do with these attempts,"" said Dmitry Peskov, a spokesman for President Putin, according to the Tass news agency. The warning was published by an international group of security services: the UK's NCSC the Canadian Communication Security Establishment (CSE) the United States Department for Homeland Security (DHS) Cyber-security Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)  the US National Security Agency (NSA) One expert said it was ""plausible"" that, despite the Kremlin's denials, Russian spies were involved. ""The received wisdom is that in cyber-space, attribution is difficult but not impossible,"" commented Emily Taylor from the Chatham House think tank. ""Usually the security services are much more hedgy in their language if they think there is any doubt.  ""Cozy Bear [the named group] has been implicated in past cyber-attacks and has left quite a trail, and there are fairly good links to the Russian state itself."" In recent years, Western security agencies have become more willing to call out hackers targeting companies and organisations in their countries in the hope it will deter them.  But the latest accusations are more unusual since officials are directly pointing the finger at Russian spies rather than talking generally about ""state-backed hackers"" or using other more cautious references.  And they are also challenging them over targeting something that the general public recognises as being highly sensitive - coronavirus vaccine research - rather than simply some company or government department's information.  However, on another level we should not be too surprised by the claim.  Understanding vaccine research and other details about the pandemic has become a top target for intelligence agencies around the world and many others, including Western spies, are likely to be active in this space. The UK, US and Canadian agencies said the hackers had exploited software flaws to get access to vulnerable computer systems, and had used malware called WellMess and WellMail to upload and download files from infected machines. They are also said to have tricked individuals into handing over login credentials with spear-phishing attacks. Phishing  emails are designed to trick the recipient into handing over their personal information Spear phishing  is a targeted and personalised form of the attack, designed to trick a specific individual. Often the email appears to come from a trusted contact, and may include some personal information to make the message seem more convincing But one cyber-security expert said the Russians were unlikely to be the only ones involved in such a campaign. ""They have lots of people, we have lots of people, the Americans have even more people, as do the Chinese,"" commented Prof Ross Anderson from the University of Cambridge's Computer Laboratory. ""They are all trying to steal this kind of stuff all the time."" Who is accused of being responsible? image copyright Crowdstrike The NCSC calls out a hacking group called APT29, also known as The Dukes or Cozy Bear. It says it is more than 95% certain that the group is part of the Russian intelligence services. Cozy Bear was first identified as being a significant ""threat actor"" in 2014, according to the American cyber-security firm Crowdstrike. It describes the group as being  ""aggressive"" in its tactics and ""nothing if not flexible, changing tool sets frequently"". The unit has previously been implicated in  hacking the US Democratic National Committee  (DNC) during the US Presidential election in 2016. In 2017, it  attacked Norway's Labour Party , defence and foreign ministries, as well as the country's national security service. The  report includes recommendations that can help protect organisations from cyber-attacks . ""Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in Covid-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of Covid-19 vaccines,"" it said. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said: ""It is completely unacceptable that the Russian intelligence services are targeting those working to combat the coronavirus pandemic. ""While others pursue their selfish interests with reckless behaviour, the UK and its allies are getting on with the hard work of finding a vaccine and protecting global health."" On Thursday, the UK government also said Russians had ""almost certainly""  sought to interfere in the 2019 UK general election  through illicitly-acquired documents. ""We worked very closely with our allies to ensure we would take measures to keep that information safe,"" said White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany, ""and we continue to do so and we are aware of those activities."" What else has the US said? by Tara McKelvey in Washington DC ""The National Security Agency, along with our partners, remains steadfast in its commitment to protecting national security by collectively issuing this critical cyber-security advisory as foreign actors continue to take advantage of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,"" said NSA cyber-security director Anne Neuberger.  Earlier in 2020, John Demers, an assistant attorney general for US national security, warned that hackers working for foreign governments were trying to steal vaccine research.  He said that the first nation to find a vaccine first will gain clout on the world stage with a ""significant geopolitical success story"". For that reason, hackers have been pursuing vaccine research in several countries. Demers and others who work in US intelligence have been watching their activities closely.

The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which has now been deleted, misspelled the shop's name. And it linked to a website that was not active and had, BBC News has learned, been registered only hours earlier.  Metro, which appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news, has now corrected its story. Pic'n'Mix-up Very, the company that owns the local rights to the Woolworths brand, confirmed it was a hoax. ""We own the Woolworths trademark in the UK,"" a spokesman told BBC News.  ""The Twitter account UKWoolworths is not connected to the Very group.""  The original tweet read: ""Here to save 2020.  ""Woolworths is coming back to your High Street, as a physical store.  ""A couple of legal things to get sorted but we're full steam ahead at Woolworths HQ. ""We want to get this right, so we need your help.  ""What do you want at your UK #YourWoolworths?"" image copyright Metro image caption Metro appears to have been the first mainstream media outlet to report the fake news Ray Walsh, scam expert at virtual private network (VPN) company ProPrivacy, said: ""It's not unsurprising that huge numbers of people around the UK have fallen for fake news surrounding the reopening of Woolworths. ""The brand was a much-loved part of UK shopping history. ""And many have fond memories of the retailer. ""But the Twitter account spreading the hoax was full of typos and spelling mistakes. ""This alone should have been enough to make it obvious that something extremely fishy was going on. ""The important take away from all of this is how social engineering and nostalgia can be used to trick people. ""And it serves as an important reminder of why people need to think carefully when using the internet to avoid falling for scams and phishing attacks."" image copyright Twitter image caption The Twitter account @UKWoolworths, which now has more than 4,000 followers, misspelled the shop's name Woolworths closed its doors for good in 2008, owing Â£385m.  The shops, famous for their Pic'n'Mix sweets, also sold kitchen and garden equipment and toys.  One of the UK's oldest chains it had 815 stores, many of which were taken over by shops such as Wilko and Poundland. The Woolworths name remains in use in Australia, New Zealand and South Africa as an unrelated retail brand. This was the fake news story 2020 needed - and it might seem less important than harmful coronavirus conspiracy theories or political disinformation, which have spread on wildfire on social media in recent months.  But it does teach us some important lessons about how and why disinformation spreads on social media.   We tend to share posts that we want to be true or that confirm our biases - who isn't missing Woolworth's pic'n'mix, especially during a pandemic?  That partly explains why the tweet from the fake Woolworth's account - which kept spelling the name of the chain wrong - went so viral. But it also highlights the need for verification - and the role of the media in amplifying disinformation.  A quick ring around would have confirmed that Woolworth's is not re-opening - but that did not stop a number of news outlets covering this fake Twitter account.

Email providers such as Google and Microsoft will work with companies like Paypal and the Bank of America to improve authentication. Phishing attacks typically involve scammers posing as familiar companies in an attempt to trick users into sharing personal information. This co-ordinated effort aims to make this more difficult. The Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting and Conformance (DMarc) - as the coalition is known - has released plans to produce a ""feedback loop"" between email receivers and senders. The initiative is the first significant attempt to bring together both email and service providers along with key security organisations. DMarc said this industry-wide involvement - which covers the receivers, senders and intermediaries of email use - will mean email providers will for the first time be able to reliably filter out unwanted emails, rather than use ""complex and imperfect measurements"" to determine threats. It will mean an agreed standard for authenticating legitimate emails arriving at the inboxes of AOL, Gmail, Hotmail and Yahoo customers. It will verify messages from Facebook, Paypal, American Greetings, Bank of America, Fidelity and LinkedIn. Vulnerable ""Email phishing defrauds millions of people and companies every year, resulting in a loss of consumer confidence in email and the internet as a whole,"" explained Paypal's Brett McDowell, chair of DMarc. ""Industry co-operation - combined with technology and consumer education - is crucial to fight phishing."" Email security firms Agari, Cloudmark, eCert, Return Path and Trusted Domain Project complete the collaboration. More companies will join the open standard as it is developed. Paypal spokesman Rob Skinner explained how the initiative is intended to make things easier for the most vulnerable part of the security chain - the human. image caption Fake emails are obvious to many users, but DMarc hopes to remove the risk of clicking completely ""Half the problem is, with the best will in the world and improving technology, ultimately it's still down to the user to decide [to open an email],"" he told the BBC. ""The key point is trying to block emails from getting to someone's inbox - taking the worry and concern out of people's minds and doing it for them."" As one of the internet's most ubiquitous payment companies, Paypal often finds itself impersonated by scammers. ""We've acknowledged it's been an issue,"" Mr Skinner said. ""We've had a stack of initiatives over the years to cut down on it. Fraudsters target any company that is well known, has a lot of customers, and operates across the globe.

phishing|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52577776|"Dark web scammers exploit Covid-19 fear and doubt By Sooraj Shah Technology of Business reporter Published 19 May 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images ""They're exploiting the fear, uncertainty and doubt people are experiencing during the pandemic, and using the anxiety and desperation to get people to buy things or click on things they wouldn't have otherwise,"" says Morgan Wright, a former senior adviser to the US Department of State anti-terrorism assistance programme. He's talking about the scammers and criminals that inhabit the ""dark web"" who have found a new angle - anxiety over Covid-19. Mr Wright, who is now chief security adviser at security software company SentinelOne, used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) about the exploitation of human behaviour.  He is now seeing some of those techniques being used on the dark web, an encrypted part of the internet that can be accessed using popular networks such as Tor. The Tor browser is privacy-focused, meaning it can obscure who is using it and what data is being accessed. It offers bad actors a way to operate with a degree of impunity, as law enforcement find it much more difficult to track down criminals that use it. image copyright Morgan Wright image caption Mr Wright used to teach behavioural analysts at the US National Security Agency (NSA) What is Tor? Tor is a way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor browser, to use it. The name is an acronym for The Onion Router. Just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network. It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department. It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points. Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity. To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit node"" - rather than the person responsible. Since the beginning of the global pandemic, marketplaces on the dark web have seen a rise in Covid-19 related products and services. Sought-after N95 masks, gowns, gloves and the drug chloroquine have all been listed on these marketplaces. Last month, security software firm IntSights found blood allegedly belonging to recovered coronavirus patients was even being offered for sale.  Criminals hope a heightened sense of fear will make people rush to buy these products, and as a result these items are not cheap; an Australian Institute of Criminology report found the average fake vaccine was being sold for about $370 (Â£300), while one supposedly sourced from China was selling for between $10-15,000 (Â£8-12,000). One of the reasons for the rise in such sales may be because many fraudsters are having to turn from their normal methods of making money on the dark web - such as selling fake flights booked using stolen airmiles - because these industries are currently dormant.  Many criminals also see an opportunity - as the majority of people are working from home, there is a greater chance of lax cyber security in place.  ""There was suddenly a huge shift [on the dark web] of talking about vulnerabilities in collaboration software when they realised people were going to be working from home,"" says IntSights chief security officer Etay Maor.  More Technology of Business How coronavirus is changing NHS technology The robot assistant that can guess what you want Solar power moves towards a breakthrough step The stealthy drones that fly like insects The secret chemical cocktails behind coronavirus testing Phishing scams have also been on the rise. These are where fraudsters pretend to be a different organisation or person by email, hoping the person will provide some login details or personal data, which can then be used to steal money or someone's identity.  ""The phishing attacks started with those pretending to be from the NHS, and then extended to secondary organisations that are related to Covid-19 like banks or HMRC emailing about funding, grants or being furloughed,"" says Javvad Malik, security advocate at training company KnowBe4. ""Now there are Covid-19 related phishing templates making their way into all of the phishing kits that are available on the dark web - meaning people can imitate Apple or LinkedIn with a set of standard templates,"" he adds. In addition, many services and products, including phishing kits are being offered at discount in ""coronavirus sales"". ""There are people who have been specialising in phishing pages, shady VPNs or spamming services for a number of years, who are now offering discounts because they believe it's the best time to make money and spread these kits,"" says Liv Rowley, threat intelligence analyst at Blueliv, a computer and network security firm. image copyright Blueliv image caption Intelligence analyst Liv Rowley monitors dark web scammers The dark web was designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, with the idea of enabling human rights activists and people within the military to talk and collaborate in a secure, anonymous way.  While the introduction of bitcoin enabled criminals to make money on the dark web, there remains a huge number of users that opt to use it for its initial purpose - speaking to others anonymously on forums. According to Mr Malik, these forums have often been used to fuel conspiracy theories around the virus. ""Conspiracies about 5G being the vehicle of this virus, or bioweaponry or that Bill Gates is the man behind it tend to crop up on the dark web,"" he says. As social media companies and other news outlets crack down on misinformation, many others may be pushed onto the dark web. These forums often act as a gateway to marketplaces, for people to plug their products or services to a targeted audience. This could be a way for fraudsters to make further money in the months to come.  image copyright Javvad Malik image caption Conspiracy theories flourish on the dark web, says Javvad Malik The flipside to this is that many journalists, activists and citizens may be using the dark web to communicate in countries where there is a lot of censorship. Tor versions of many news outlets,  including the BBC  and New York Times, may be used if the original sites are blocked by governments or states, for instance.  Netblocks, a digital rights advocacy group says that many countries have cut access to the web in different ways, as they seek to control the flow of information about the coronavirus outbreak. Two ransomware groups had said they would not attack any hospitals or healthcare organisations during the pandemic, but as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab outlined in a recent press briefing, there is evidence that criminal gangs are actively targeting national and international organisations that are responding to the pandemic - including hospitals. ""These organisations are targeted because of how vulnerable they are at this time and because of the likelihood that a ransom would be paid,"" says Charity Wright, cyber threat intelligence adviser at IntSights. The co-ordination and orchestration of many of these attacks often begin on the dark web. image copyright IntSights image caption Dark Web scammers are targeting healthcare, says Etay Maor ""We are seeing more offerings on the dark web specifically for healthcare-related information and for targeting healthcare facilities and doctors. There's even a database someone has created on the dark web with all kinds of information about medical staff,"" says Etay Maor from IntSights.  At its core, the dark web may still be being used for the same reasons it was intended to be used for - from a privacy and security perspective. But criminals are using this to try to exploit a global crisis for financial gain. ""That's the double-edged sword that as a society we haven't quite worked out: how do we safeguard freedom of speech and ensure privacy, but at the same time track down and stop people abusing those freedoms?"" says Javvad Malik.

Californian authorities filed felony charges against Mason Sheppard, 19.  The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) confirmed it had searched a property in Bognor Regis with police on Friday.  A teenager in Tampa and Nima Fazeli, 22, of Orlando, were also charged in Florida. US Attorney David L Anderson said the arrests proved ""nefarious hacking... for fun or profit"" did not pay off.  Twitter accounts of multiple high-profile US figures  were hijacked in an apparent Bitcoin scam on 15 July. They included former President Barack Obama, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, entrepreneur Elon Musk, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and reality star Kim Kardashian West, who all falsely tweeted out requests for Bitcoin donations. In his statement, US Attorney Anderson said: ""There is a false belief within the criminal hacker community that attacks like the Twitter hack can be perpetrated anonymously and without consequence.""   He added: ""Criminal conduct over the Internet may feel stealthy to the people who perpetrate it, but there is nothing stealthy about it.  In particular, I want to say to would-be offenders, break the law, and we will find you.""

The charges include organised fraud and fraudulent use of personal information.  ""As a crypto-currency, Bitcoin is difficult to track and recover if stolen in a scam,"" Mr Warren said. ""These crimes were perpetrated using the names of famous people and celebrities, but they're not the primary victims here. This 'Bit-Con' was designed to steal money from regular Americans from all over the country, including here in Florida. ""This massive fraud was orchestrated right here in our backyard, and we will not stand for that."" image copyright AFP/REUTERS image caption Kim Kardashian West, Kanye West, Elon Musk, Bill Gates and Barack Obama were all 'hacked' The charges against the teenager include 17 counts of communication fraud, 10 counts of fraudulent use of personal information, one count of fraudulent use of personal information with over $100,000 (Â£76,340) or 30 or more victims, one count of organised fraud and one count of access to computers or electronic devices without authority. ""He's a 17 year-old kid who apparently just graduated high school,"" said State Attorney Warren. ""But no make no mistake, this was not an ordinary 17-year-old. This was a highly sophisticated attack on a magnitude not seen before."" He added that the investigation to ""discover the perpetrator"" was a collaboration between the Florida Department of Law enforcement, the US Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California,  the FBI , the IRS, and the Secret Service. The teenager lives in Tampa, Florida and so will be prosecuted by Hillsborough State authorities.  Twitter said in a statement: ""We appreciate the swift actions of law enforcement in this investigation and will continue to cooperate as the case progresses. ""For our part, we are focused on being transparent and providing updates regularly."" After the hack, Twitter said the hackers had targeted its employees ""with access to internal systems and tools"". It added that ""significant steps"" had been taken to limit access to such internal systems and tools while the company's investigation continued. According to BBC cyber-security reporter Joe Tidy, the consensus in the information security community is that Twitter's employees were likely duped by a spear-phishing attack via a phone call. This involves using friendly persuasion and trickery to get victims to hand over crucial information that enables hackers to infiltrate a company's systems.

phishing|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-16785833|"Fraudsters go phishing for pop music, says producer By Greg Cochrane Newsbeat music reporter Published 31 January 2012 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright PA image caption Emeli Sande, Jay-Z and The Ting Tings We usually hear about phishing attacks in the technology world - when impostors try to scam people out of money by tricking them into handing over their personal details.  But now it's said the technique has found its way into pop music. Producer Richard X says he's received contact from fraudsters ""disguising"" themselves as industry workers requesting he sends them music. ""They get a little bit of information by searching databases, publishers catalogues or reading forums,"" says X, sat in his London studio.  ""That's enough for them to write a cheeky email disguised as someone from the management, touring agency or someone related to the artists in an attempt to get you, the producer, to send them finished tracks or demos."" 'Fan-driven' Richard X, who has worked with Kelis, M.I.A. and the original Sugababes, puts this recent development down to the actions of tech-savvy ""rabid fans"".  ""You might think that someone wouldn't fall for these emails, but in a high turnover, fast environment, which making records is now, things are needed instantly. It's possible that you would send something,"" explains X. ""I know of a producer recently who did send out the demos and the masters to a random person."" Online leaks of music traditionally come from a range of sources - everything from the artist passing new music on to a friend to a journalist leaking a promotional copy or even a producer being careless with a storage hard drive.  This development comes as many of the collaborations which regularly fill the top 40 have been recorded without the artists ever having been in the same room. Instead, parts of songs are recorded and exchanged online via email, digital lockers or upload sites. Earlier this month, he tweeted a link to a pop phishing email he'd been sent. ""Not to encourage things, but it does seem like an interesting way of trying to get hold of these unreleased gems,"" he says. ""The fan-driven mentality, and rightly so, is that they want to hear new things and will do anything to get the exclusive. I personally don't think it's a big evil piracy network behind it all."" Sales threat   Whatever the motives, Paul Smernicki, Head of Digital at Universal Records, says it's a broad problem his company is increasingly on the look out for.  ""People through the label have been made aware to be vigilant,"" he says. ""With that particular method, the intent can only be interpreted as malicious."" He says music leaking online from his artists (Universal - the world's biggest record label looks after everyone from Lady Gaga to Take That) is a ""relatively frequent"" occurrence. ""If someone walked up to you in the street dressed as a policeman and tried to get you to do something, that would be pretty shocking,"" says Smernicki.  ""The ingenuity is surprising, but not the intent."" He says pop phishing is among the acts of fraudsters who ""really want to damage an album campaign"" and that if music fans can get access to tracks for free, it could hurt sales. ""Some people, lots of people, may not go and buy the album,"" he says. ""People invest loads of time, energy and emotion into doing their jobs and doing them as well as they possibly can. To have the rug pulled out from under is really hard."" He says security can be an issue and points to Jay-Z and Kanye West's Watch The Throne album as an ""extreme example"" of artists taking music protection into their own hands.  The rappers held tracks on fingerprint-protected hard drives and recorded in pop-up studios in international hotel rooms.  Artists' view From it being mastered to it hitting shelves, it's not unusual for a track or an album to be sat waiting for months.  Brits Critics Choice winner Emeli SandÃ© finished her debut album last year, but it doesn't get released until 13 February. She says she hoped it wouldn't leak, but that it feels ""almost like an inevitability now that someone will find it and it will get out"". ""It's a real shame if it affects actual sales,"" SandÃ© told Newsbeat.  ""People don't understand how much work goes into making a record. How much time and how hard it is to even get it released. I feel quite upset that it happens."" The Ting Tings' second album, Sounds From Nowheresville, has already appeared online despite not being released until March. Multi-instrumentalist with the Salford band, Jules de Martino, takes a different view.  ""Art should always have a price. I'm not a big fan of people stealing stuff, even if it's a penny,"" he explains.  ""But if you're doing your stuff honestly, creatively and it's good, then I think you will stay in the game as long as you can - sales apart. ""If you're doing all right that price comes back because you're selling it in another form, whether it's tickets, T-shirts or records.""

Scam victims were duped after being told they had won a lottery. Authorities seized 14 laptops, seven memory sticks and 23 mobile phones, as well as fake documents and cash. The arrests come after security firm Kaspersky reported that India now sent more spam than any other country in the world. Police said the six men, all Nigerian, would be remanded in custody until 12 January. The arrests signal attempts to crack down on a growing cybercrime problem in the region. Mumbai-based internet security specialist Vijay Mukhi said poor enforcement of laws meant spammers could act with impunity. ""We have an Information Technology Act that was introduced in 2000. But we don't have any convictions under it and it's silent on spam,"" he said. ""If I'm a spammer, I would rather spam from India to India and the rest of world because nothing will happen to me."" Free rein In its report, Kaspersky said 14.8% of all spam email sent in the three months prior to the end of September had originated in India. Darya Gudhova, Kaspersky's spam analyst, said a lack of security awareness had given spammers free rein. She added that there was a growing level of cybercrime activity in developing regions such as Asia and Latin America. The Internet and Mobile Association of India (IMAI) estimates that the country has more than 112 million internet users, the third largest in the world after the US and China. About seven million new users are being added every month, the IMAI said. David Emm, a security researcher from Kaspersky Labs, said this growth was making life difficult for the authorities - but believed the arrests signalled a strong sign of intent from the Indian government to get a grip on scammers. ""One of the good things is that they are taking it as a serious issue,"" he told the BBC. ""Cybercrime activity is breaking out of the western European theatre and starting to affect other parts of the globe because of the massive growth in IT. ""[In Europe] we've had cybercrime legislation for a long time with lots of expertise and history of dealing with it - but if you go to other areas like Brazil or India, you find they don't necessarily have specific cybercrime legislation.""

Scams regularly catch out hundreds of thousands of users at a time. ""There's over 700 million users on Facebook,"" Websense's Spencer Parker told the BBC.  ""As a piece of real estate, it's extremely profitable to be targeted by malware writers."" The protection will be powered by Websense's ""Threatseeker Cloud"", a system which stores a database of known malicious URLs. The system can also detect unknown dangerous URLs by assessing threats in real-time. This means harmful URLs can be blocked even before they are known to the company - cutting off a key tactic used by phishers in which constantly changing URLs fool database-driven protection. In addition, the system will ""follow"" links made using popular URL shorteners - such as bit.ly and ow.ly - to verify their safety. Due to the nature of how we interact with our friends, Mr Parker says phishing attacks on Facebook are much harder to prevent than other commonly used techniques. ""One of the things with Facebook, of course, is that you have that element of trust in a social network. If one of your friends posts something, you automatically trust it more than if it just received as a spam email. ""As more of these 'friend in the middle' attacks happen, you start to trust your friends less.""

The call had come from what looked like a genuine TSB number, but it was a spoof and the caller was a fraudster. Impersonation scams such as this nearly doubled to 15,000 cases in the first half of the year, according to new figures from banking trade body UK Finance. The criminal persuaded Mr Bale that funds needed to be transferred to a ""safe account"", so he allowed payments totalling nearly Â£6,000 to be made. ""I felt humiliated and very foolish, but they were very convincing. Everyone is gullible when you are caught on the hop,"" the 76-year-old said. ""I felt myself in a spider's web, only slowly did I become aware there was something odd."" Refund question When the con-artist demanded more information Mr Bale become more suspicious, ending the call and contacting the bank. The money was refunded under a TSB pledge to cover all fraud losses suffered by innocent victims. Thousands of other victims of fraud have not been so lucky. Most of the biggest players in the UK banking sector are signed up to an agreement to ensure victims of so-called authorised push payment fraud are refunded when they or their bank are not to blame. However, with Â£126m of losses considered under the new code in the first half of the year, only Â£48m (38%) was refunded, new data from UK Finance shows. Banks reveal 10 coronavirus scams to be wary of Aged over 100 and targeted by fraudsters Banks consider cases individually, and point out that some people are not refunded as they have ignored scam warnings. However, concerns have been raised over the inconsistency of the code between different banks. Regulators have warned that  the ""right outcomes"" had not always resulted in these cases , and UK Finance now wants the code to become law. Overall, Â£208m was lost to authorised push payment fraud in the first half of the year, when victims were persuaded to make transfers to people they believe are genuine traders or service providers.  A total of Â£374m was lost to criminals through other, unauthorised fraud, such as when banking security systems are circumvented. Covid warning UK Finance has warned that criminals are using the coronavirus crisis to trick people - often as they use online or mobile banking for the first time - into giving their personal and financial details. As a result, it expects fraud levels to rise in the latter half of the year and early next year. ""Criminals have ruthlessly adapted to this pandemic with scams exploiting the rise in people working from home and spending time online,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance. ""These range from investment scams promoted on social media and search engines to the use of phishing emails and fake websites to harvest people's data.""

Kent Commercial Services (KCS) delivers services and supplies to public authorities, including protective equipment during the Covid-19 crisis. No ransom was paid and no personal data relating to taxpayers was stolen, KCS said. The Information Commissioner said KCS had been given data protection advice.

The hackers encrypted the firm's systems and data and demanded payment to release and repair them on 2 April. Stolen data that went on the dark web contained business and corporate information relating to business activities of KCS, based in Aylesford. It took the company over four weeks to get the majority of systems back online with additional security, with remaining systems going live in the next two weeks.

The National Cyber Security Centre has issued an alert after a recent spike in attacks on educational institutions. These have been ""ransomware"" incidents which block access to computer systems. Paul Chichester, the NCSC's director of operations, says such attacks are ""reprehensible"". The return to school, college and university, already facing problems with Covid-19, now faces an increased risk from cyber-attacks, which the security agency says could ""de-rail their preparations for the new term"". 'Devastating' The cyber-security body, part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, says attacks can have a ""devastating impact"" and take weeks or months to put right. Newcastle University and Northumbria have both been targeted by cyber-attacks this month, and a group of further education colleges in Yorkshire and a higher education college in Lancashire faced attacks last month. Newcastle University faces cyber-attack Northumbria University hit by cyber-attack UK universities in Blackbaud attack Leeds college group under cyber-attack Hackers beat university cyber-defences in two hours Students blamed for college cyber-attacks The warning from the NCSC follows a spate of ransomware attacks against academic institutions - in which malicious software or ""malware"" is used to lock out users from their own computer systems, paralysing online services, websites and phone networks. The security agency says this is often followed by a ransom note demanding payment for the recovery of this frozen or stolen data - sometimes with the added threat of publicly releasing sensitive information. image copyright Google image caption Newcastle University faced a cyber-attack this month Universities have frequently been targets of cyber-attacks - with up to a thousand attacks per year in the UK.  Attacks can be attempts to obtain valuable research information that is commercially and politically sensitive. Universities also hold much personal data about students, staff and, in some cases, former students who might have made donations. Earlier this summer  more than 20 universities and charities in the UK, US and Canada were caught up in a ransomware cyber-attack  involving a cloud computing supplier, Blackbaud. A Freedom of Information inquiry in July, carried out by the TopLine Comms digital public relations company, found 35 UK universities, out of 105 responses, had faced ransomware attacks over the past decade. There were 25 which had not had attacks - and a further 43 which declined to answer. One university reported 42 separate ransomware attacks since 2013. The warning from the NCSC highlights the vulnerability of online systems for remote working, as increased numbers of staff are working from home.  ""Phishing"" attacks, where people are tricked into clicking on a malicious link such as in an email, also remains a common pathway for such ransomware attempts, says the advice. 'Criminal targeting' Mr Chichester of the NCSC says: ""The criminal targeting of the education sector, particularly at such a challenging time, is utterly reprehensible."" ""I would strongly urge all academic institutions to take heed of our alert."" Universities UK says data security has had to become a priority for higher education - and that ""protections are in place to manage threats as much as possible"". The universities body also says it is working with the NCSC to produce ""robust guidance on cyber-security"" which will be released later this academic year.

When FBI agents seized his devices in 2019, they also found he had downloaded child sexual abuse images and videos. He  pleaded guilty to the charges and will be sentenced in April . In 2016, Hernandez and an associate had used a ""phishing"" attack to trick a Nintendo employee into handing over their login details, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) said. He used these to download confidential files and information about the Nintendo Switch, which he leaked to the public. In 2017, when Hernandez was still under 18, the FBI visited him at his parents' home, in California.  He told the officers he would stop hacking and understood the consequences if he continued. media caption Technology explained: What is phishing?

With schools closed and many working from home, children are more likely to be using the internet unsupervised. The agency also said cyber-criminals are taking advantage of the crisis.

As a response it says it is ""redoubling"" its efforts to bring them to justice and is deploying more officers online. So far, the NCA has taken down six web domains known to be exploiting the virus. However, one expert believes criminals are also exploiting the fact that people are at home by calling landlines. Founder of the Fraud Alert website and former Metropolitan Police detective, Colin Holder, is one of many security experts who monitor dark web criminal forums for signs of new scamming methods. Often criminals will share ""templates"" or guides showing how to crack passwords and defraud people. He said they would now look to cash in on landline numbers they may have purchased in recent years.  ""They are trading a vast amount of mobile numbers every day, but a lot of people now don't answer mobile numbers they don't recognise,"" Mr Holder said. ""If you are at home, you are very likely to answer your landline - so we have seen home numbers being traded quite consistently. This is the time they will look to use them. ""Criminals never want to spend money, but where else can you get someone else's home phone number from now?"" Mr Holder said criminals will often start the call with the home occupant's name to ""lull"" them into a conversation. ""Then if they have some data from an official source it makes them sound legitimate,"" he added. Mr Holder said criminals may not even ask for a bank account - they may be looking for a piece of information that could lead to a password or the answer to a commonly used security question such as ""mother's maiden name"". image copyright Sean McGrath image caption Sean McGrath of proprivacy.com says the number of malicious websites launched during the crisis has reached 80,000 Editor of the proprivacy.com website Sean McGrath has compiled a list of newly registered websites linked to phishing scams or considered ""malicious"" by security companies since the outbreak. In January, there were 1,772 new URLs registered worldwide. In March that jumped to 62,771. They include website titles such as ""childcarecorona.com"" and ""heatingincorona.com"".  Many appear to look legitimate and feature the same wording and branding as the World Health Organisation. ""At the very least the websites are spreading misinformation,"" said Mr McGrath. ""They are part of campaigns that want to spread a message that is disingenuous. ""At the other end these are sites that, by getting you to download something, are installing malware or ransomware on your computer. ""The criminality is spreading at the same rate as the virus itself."" Mr McGrath said the websites work by preying on a need for information in a time of crisis. Most are sent out as a link in a phishing email. How to stay safe?

Mark Telling, though, does exist and had no idea a company had been set up in his name. When we told him his personal details had been stolen to set up a bogus company to steal money from the government, he was horrified. ""That's crazy, shocking, it's going to worry us to death,"" he said. UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud Mark - who's 47 and works in the building trade - and his partner are saving to buy a house. ""I don't know what else is to come,"" he added. And Mark may be one of many. Victims could find themselves liable for the debt and have their credit rating badly affected. media caption Watch the moment Mark Telling finds out he's been a victim of fraud A BBC investigation has found criminals are setting up fake businesses on an industrial scale and successfully applying for government-backed Covid emergency loans - with no intention of paying the money back. They claim up to Â£50,000 on each application. The Bounce Back Loan Scheme - or BBLS - was announced in April and is designed to help small firms stay afloat during the crisis.  The loans are 100% backed by the government and do not have to be paid off for six years. They are interest free for the first 12 months, and are administered by 12 banks. But we have uncovered evidence criminals are taking advantage of the system and could be making millions of pounds.  'Scandal' One fraud expert, a retired detective, has called it a ""scandal"" and said we may never know the true scale of the problem. The Treasury insists banks are taking ""appropriate precautions"" and the government would take ""criminal action against the most serious cases"". The revelations come after the head of the National Audit Office  told the Guardian  the BBLS was the ""riskiest"" of all the bailout measures. So, how does the fraud work? Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums. They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The rules state the scheme should only apply to firms set up before 1 March 2020.   But we've seen successful applications for companies that were created as late as June. 'Free money' We met a fraud investigator who has successfully infiltrated a criminal gang online. His work is highly sensitive so he asked to remain anonymous. He showed us the details of multiple people who had their personal details stolen, of businesses set up in their names and Bounce Back Loans applied for. Typically the criminals apply for the maximum of Â£50,000. The fraud investigator told us ""it seems to be free money for the scammers"". ""There are hundreds, possibly thousands of people involved, engaged in this. It's going to cost us billions,"" he said. We also obtained data from Companies House that indicates a sharp increase in the registration of new companies after the BBLS was announced.  In early March registrations were running at 15,602 per week. After lockdown that figure halved to 7,571 per week.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced the scheme on 27 April. Registrations then rose to a record 21,616 by the end of June.  We don't know how many of those new companies might be fake - or how many actually applied for a loan. Former detective and now civilian fraud and money laundering expert Martin Woods says the scheme was always vulnerable. ""Criminals identified it as a fabulous opportunity,"" he said, adding there were inadequate checks on the applications that were made. He added: ""Ultimately, it will be our children and grandchildren who pay for this."" LOOK-UP TOOL:  How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:  We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:  What it means and why it matters LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:  What happens if you have one? Acuris Risk Intelligence, which tracks online fraud, claims to have found more than 100 fake businesses set up by one criminal gang alone. Its CEO Joel Lange said: ""This type of fraud could have been prevented by conducting even the most basic checks by the banks."" UK Finance, which represents the banking sector, rejected the criticisms, saying: ""Lenders have a range of checks in place to detect and prevent fraudulent activity."" That includes ""a cross-industry initiative to check if duplicate applications have been made"", it said. Everything BBC News discovered is being made available to the authorities.

Researchers at Cisco found 74 groups on Facebook that openly traded stolen credit card numbers and bank account details. The groups had a regular membership of about 385,000 people, they found. Facebook said it had shut down the groups for breaking the social network's policies on financial fraud. Cashing in Jon Munshaw and Jaeson Schultz from Cisco's Talos security division  detailed their findings in a blog  and said they were surprised that the thieves were operating ""right out in the open"". Often, said the pair, pursuing cyber-criminals involved tracing them to hidden servers on dark web addresses, rather than just searching on social media sites. Instead, they said, the gangs operating on Facebook took few steps to conceal what they were doing. The groups exhibited a wide variety of behaviours that spanned the spectrum from ""shady"" to ""illegal"". Some openly advertised hacking, phishing and spamming services, while others sought buyers for stolen personal finance information that included both credit card numbers and personal documents, including driving licences and ID cards. image copyright Reuters image caption Large-scale phishing scams targeting iPhone users were run via the Facebook groups Facebook's own algorithms also proved useful because they ""helpfully"" suggested other similar-themed groups once the two researchers started looking for card thieves, spammers and other cyber-criminals. Across the groups, payment was accepted in crypto-currencies or via payment services such as PayPal, said the Talos team. Some groups used middlemen or ""mules"" to pipe cash to buyers.  The Talos researchers said they initially tried to get the groups shut down by using Facebook's own on-site tools but this proved ineffective. To make a bigger impact, the team built up links with Facebook's internal security team and passed on detailed information about the criminal marketplaces.  This led to the ""majority"" of the groups being removed, they said, but some were still active and Talos was still working to shut these down.   Facebook said it removed groups that ""violated"" policies against spam and financial fraud. It added: ""We know we need to be more vigilant and we're investing heavily to fight this type of activity.""

The information was accessed ""on at least one occasion"" by an unknown user. The database, which was for marketing purposes, contained phone numbers, home and email addresses. It did not include passwords or financial details. The breach was not due to a hack or a criminal attack, but because the database had been ""incorrectly configured"" by a member of staff not following the correct procedures, Virgin Media said.  The firm was alerted to the problem on Friday after it was spotted by a security researcher at TurgenSec. The company said almost all of those affected were Virgin customers with television or fixed-line telephone accounts, although the database also included some Virgin Mobile customers as well as potential customers referred by friends as part of a promotion. Virgin Media, which is owned by US cable group, Liberty Global, has informed the Information Commissioner's Office as required, and launched a forensic investigation. Four times more data breaches logged in UK Rail station wi-fi provider exposed traveller data Thousands lose broadband after workers break cable Lutz SchÃ¼ler, chief executive of Virgin Media said: ""We recently became aware that one of our marketing databases was incorrectly configured which allowed unauthorised access. We immediately solved the issue by shutting down access."" ""Protecting our customers' data is a top priority and we sincerely apologise,"" he said. ""Based upon our investigation, Virgin Media does believe that the database was accessed on at least one occasion but we do not know the extent of the access or if any information was actually used,"" Mr Schuler said. Virgin Media said it would be emailing those affected on Thursday, in order to warn them about the risks of phishing, nuisance calls and identity theft. The message will include a reminder not to click on unknown links in emails and not to provide personal details to unverified callers. Further advice was available on its website, it said.   The fact that Virgin Media's database hasn't been actively hacked is reassuring for customers, but while the details are light, it sounds like human error is to blame and that is rather embarrassing for a tech firm. Ten months is a long time for all that data to have just been sitting there, waiting to be found.  And while no passwords or bank details were among it, there's an awful lot of contact information for a cyber-criminal to work with. Phishing expeditions - when someone tries to get financial information out of a victim by pretending to be a company with a legitimate reason for contact - are not particularly sophisticated, but they are effective for those caught off-guard, and can be a lucrative source of income. It's unclear whether this was yet another case of unsecured data being stored on a cloud service that's easily searchable if you know how. There have been dozens of examples of this lately, including just this week a database of the personal details of people using train station wi-fi around the UK. Virgin Media has apologised and really, there's very little practical advice to offer in the light of this kind of breach, beyond the usual protocol of staying alert to any messages requesting personal information or access to any kind of finance.

It received 467,361 complaints from individuals and businesses during the year and has had nearly five million since its inception in 2000. Phishing and extortion remain the most popular ways of scamming people. It says techniques are becoming more sophisticated, making it harder for people to tell ""real from fake"". This is especially true of web and email addresses that are fooling people because they look increasingly legitimate. Last year IC3 had 13,633 complaints from victims of so-called tech-support fraud, which involves a scammer phoning an individual and claiming there is a problem with their computer that needs immediate fixing.  'Keep reporting it' Losses amounted to more than $54m and complaints came from victims in 48 countries. The vast majority were over 60 years of age. Ransomware - where hackers lock down computers and demand a payment to unlock them - netted more than $8.9m over the year, according to the group.  It urged members of the public to continue reporting crimes. ""Information reported to the IC3 plays a vital role in the FBI's ability to understand our cyber-adversaries and their motives, which, in turn, helps us to impose risks and consequences on those who break our laws and threaten our national security,"" said assistant director of the FBI's cyber division Matt Gorham.

Area 1 Security said it was not clear what the hackers were searching for when they hacked Burisma Holdings. Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden was previously on the board of the firm. Burisma, the US government and Russia's Ministry of Defence are yet to respond. Area 1 linked the hack - a ""phishing"" attack - to Russia's military intelligence unit known commonly as the GRU. A timeline of the Trump-Ukraine story White House blocked Ukraine aid just after Trump call Three Republican impeachment claims, fact-checked President Trump was impeached in December over allegations that he improperly pressured Ukraine's leader Volodymyr Zelensky to launch an investigation into Burisma and its links to the Bidens. The security firm also drew parallels between November's hack and another that was carried out against Democrats in 2016, before the US presidential election.  How was Burisma hacked? In its eight-page report, California-based firm Area 1 said the GRU hackers behind the Burisma breach are known by the alias ""Fancy Bear"" among cybersecurity researchers. The hackers used ""phishing"" emails that are designed to steal usernames and passwords, the California-based security firm said. In this case, Burisma employees were sent what looked like internal company emails and fake websites that looked like the sign-in pages of Burisma subsidiaries. Using this tactic, the hackers managed to get into Burisma's servers, it added. Area 1 said it became aware of the hack after its email security scanning product found suspicious evidence online, including ""decoy domains"" for the fake websites. A source close to Burisma told Reuters news agency that the company's website had been subject to a number of break-in attempts over the past six months. Why is Burisma important? Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, is at the heart of the impeachment proceedings against President Trump. In a phone call in July 2019, President Trump pushed for Ukrainian President Zelensky to announce an investigation into Burisma and the Bidens. image copyright Getty Images image caption Mr Trump asked Ukrainian President Zelensky to open an investigation into Burisma and Joe Biden's son Specifically, Mr Trump wanted Kyiv to look into a debunked theory that Joe Biden had previously tried to quash a probe of Burisma in order to protect his son. President Trump is now due to stand trial in the Senate on two articles of impeachment - abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. He denies any wrongdoing. How is this linked to 2016? The Burisma hack ""really is starting to parallel with what we saw in 2016"", Area 1 co-founder Oren Falkowitz told Reuters. That year, hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and to the campaign of President Trump's then-electoral rival, Hillary Clinton. Area 1 co-founders Mr Falkowitz and Blake Darche added: ""The timing of the GRU's campaign in relation to the 2020 US elections raises the specter that this is an early warning of what we have anticipated since the successful cyberattacks undertaken during the 2016 US elections."" Mr Darche also told Reuters that they were ""100% certain"" that the GRU was behind the hacking. media caption Trump has been impeached - how did we get here?

Instead of trading on marketplaces, criminals have turned to ""gated"" chat forums, invitation-only communities and encrypted apps, say researchers.  The change could make it hard for law enforcement agencies to spot and trace attacks, they warn. They also found a large increase in attacks aimed at big companies. Hidden chatter The study embedded undercover researchers into a wide variety of forums and gated chat forums on the dark net. The dark net is the part of the internet not accessible to search engines such as Google, and for which people need a special browser to visit. The most well-known dark net is accessed via the Tor browser. Successful efforts by police to infiltrate dark net marketplaces as well as raids that saw many of them closed down, had pushed criminal hackers to adopt more secure ways of communicating, said Dr Mike McGuire, a criminologist from the University of Surrey, who led the project. ""It's not as vibrant as it once was because they know the feds are listening and that they will take down markets,"" he said. While criminal gangs were still active on those publicly accessible marketplaces, said Dr McGuire, any conversations about targets and tactics were instantly moved to secure apps such as Telegram or separate forums and chat rooms. ""It's becoming like an invisible internet,"" he told the BBC. ""That's going to be worrying for law enforcement."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Most dark net deals are for drugs but cyber-crime services can easily be found on the hidden sites For the study, researchers posed as customers and quizzed hackers about the cost of a wide variety of cyber-attacks, They probed market rates for tailored malware attacks, phishing campaigns, industrial espionage and insider information. Sample costs included: remote logins for corporate networks $2-$30 (Â£1.50-Â£24) targeted attack on company $4,500 targeted attack on individual $2,000 phishing kits $40 fake Amazon receipts and invoices $52 Espionage and insider trading $1,000 - $15,000 The cyber-crime economy that had emerged on the dark net was a mirror to the legitimate industry, said Ian Pratt, co-founder of security firm Bromium that sponsored the research.  The cyber-crime economy was diverse and sophisticated, he said, with many hacking gangs specialising in just one aspect of an attack, such as crafting malware, writing convincing phishing emails or setting up sites to grab data from victims. It was also clear, he said, that the hackers could get access to almost any network they desired.  ""It's not hard to get into corporate networks,"" he said, adding that the most successful method of winning access was via a well-crafted phishing campaign.  He said adverts and listings for attacks on enterprises had grown by 20% since 2016, suggesting corporates were becoming a lucrative target. image copyright NCA image caption Police forces should take a broader view of dark net cyber-thieves, say researchers A successful phishing attack gave hackers ""instant deep access"" said Mr Pratt, that they could then build on to either get at saleable data or to thoroughly compromise a target. The changing nature of the dark net underworld should prompt police to change the way they tackle cyber-crime, said Dr McGuire. ""Law enforcement have a very focused and narrow perception and take down particular groups,"" he said. ""But by taking out specific groups they are not making much of a dent in it."" If one group disappeared or was broken up by police another would just move to fill in the gap, he added.  ""It's like cutting the head off a hydra.""

Up to 60% of emergency pandemic loans made under the Bounce Back scheme may never be repaid, a report by the government's spending watchdog says.  The National Audit Office (NAO) said taxpayers could lose as much as Â£26bn, from fraud, organised crime or default. The lending scheme carried lighter checks than others and was aimed at small businesses unable to access other pandemic funding support. A recent BBC investigation revealed  how fraudsters were using the loan system.  Many of those affected will have no idea their names have been used until repayment letters begin arriving in early summer. One of the victims spoken to by the BBC, Mark Telling, said he was worried ""to death"" to discover a company set up in his name by a criminal had ""borrowed"" Â£50,000 from the bail-out scheme.  The BBC also spoke to Sue Burden, who had also found her identity had been stolen to set up a bogus company to access the scheme. She said she had gone ""from tears to anger... now I'm going to be scared to do anything"". The BBC reported last week  that the government was warned back in May  that the scheme was at ""very high risk of fraud"" from ""organised crime"". The government said it has tried to minimise fraud through lenders' background checks.  Extension The scheme provides firms with 100% government-backed finance worth up to Â£50,000. Demand has been greater than anticipated, and the total value of these loans is now expected to be Â£38bn-Â£48bn, up from an estimate of Â£18bn-Â£26bn. They do not have to be paid off for 10 years and offer a range of flexible payment options.  The  loan scheme is an extension of earlier offers which some businesses complained they could not access as the lending criteria was too strict.  The NAO report warned that the speed with which the scheme was rolled out heightened the fraud risk. It took a month to ensure businesses could not receive more than one loan.  'My name was used to steal a government Covid loan' Arrest over Â£110k Covid small business loan fraud UK banks get 100,000 loan applications on first day The Public Accounts Committee said it was the government's largest and most risky business support scheme.  It says it will not assess the value-for-money of the scheme, as the loans will not start being paid back until May next year.  The NAO analysis said losses from the scheme are likely to reach ""significantly above"" normal estimates for public-sector fraud of 0.5% to 5%.  The report also said the UK's five biggest banks will make nearly Â£1bn between them from the scheme. 'Taxpayer's expense' Meg Hillier, chair of the Public Accounts Committee, said the loans had been a vital lifeline for many businesses.  But she added that ""the government estimates that up to 60% of the loans could turn bad - this would be a truly eye-watering loss of public money"".  ""The bounce back loan scheme got money into the hands of small businesses quickly, and will have stopped some from going under. ""But the scheme's hasty launch means criminals may have helped themselves to billions of pounds at the taxpayer's expense. ""Sadly, many firms won't be able to repay their loans and the banks will be quick to wash their hands of the problem.  Analysis: Angus Crawford, BBC news correspondent  Today's report confirms what many people had suspected.   In May, the government had to get money to small businesses as quickly as possible, before tens of thousands of them went bust.   But to do that, they had to make compromises on credit and fraud checks.  This opened the doors to a whole range of problems - including fraud by organised criminal gangs.   We've found evidence of more than 100 bogus firms set up by scammers to make fraudulent applications - getting the maximum Â£50,000 each time.   They've used the stolen, personal details of innocent victims to set up the fake companies - victims who won't know anything about it until the letters demanding repayment start arriving through their doors next summer.  How it's done:  Gangs steal victims' personal details using phishing emails or buying them on criminal forums.  They then set up a bogus business in their name. After opening a business bank account they then apply for a Bounce Back Loan through the same bank. The taxpayer is in the same position - waiting to find out how much the scheme will ultimately cost us.  The warning from the National Audit Office is clear - it has the potential to be ""very high"". Sue and Dave Burden, from the south of England, were shocked to find that Sue's identity had been stolen to set up a company and claim a bounce back loan.  ""I've gone from tears to anger,"" she told the BBC. ""Now I'm going to be scared to do anything."" The state-owned British Business Bank (BBB), which supervises the bounce back loan scheme, twice raised concerns, firstly in May.  The BBB expects it will pay out Â£1.07bn in interest payments to the high street lenders that provided the cash.  Most of this will go to UK's five biggest banks, Barclays, HSBC, Lloyds, NatWest and Santander, which provided Â£31.3bn of funding. According to latest Treasury figures , there have been 1.55 million applications for the loans, with 1.26 million approvals. ""We targeted this support to help those who need it most as quickly as possible and we won't apologise for this,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We've looked to minimise fraud - with lenders implementing a range of protections including anti-money laundering and customer checks, as well as transaction monitoring controls.

This week, after seven years of building up thousands of Instagram followers, a small company on the south coast of England found its account had been hacked. The English Stamp Company tried to let Instagram know. But in a response that evening, the social media giant said the account had been permanently deleted. ""We're sorry for any inconvenience this causes,"" Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, said in the automated message. ""It's gutting, the fact that it's the last seven years of work, and it's disappointing that Instagram appears unwilling to help,"" says Bella Dorey, 27, one of three people in the firm who manage the account. Reliant The company, which makes rubber stamps, was founded in 1992 by Bella's father and mother, Jon and Sasha, and has seven employees. It had built up nearly 29,000 followers on its Instagram account, and was hoping to get to 30,000 by Christmas. It uses Instagram as its main marketing tool, and was relying on the social media platform to boost Christmas sales, especially as coronavirus has put a stop to the usual exhibitions the company uses to showcase its wares.

""How do you put a value on more than 28,000 followers?"" Hack and demands On Tuesday the company got a message from Instagram saying there had been an unusual login to its account from a computer in Huddersfield. The BBC verified with a computer security expert that this message was genuine. Bella and a colleague immediately tried to get in contact with Instagram but just four minutes later, they got an email from the hackers, who called themselves ""Carlo Minhift"". image copyright Westend61 ""Good Day! We apologize for the inconvenience. Your account has been temporarily blocked,"" the email said. The hackers said they would wait two hours, then start ""clearing"" the account by deleting photos if Bella and her colleagues did not respond. The next day, the hackers revealed their intention had been to extort money from the small firm. But they were too late, Instagram had already deleted the account. ""We didn't want to ruin your account, but you don't respond to us. We realized that you will not pay us. No, not really. We apologize for not being convenient, but we unfortunately start clearing the account after 30 minutes and sell it. See you later,"" the hackers said. 'Target' Attacks on Instagram users, while rarer than other forms of cyber attack, are becoming increasingly common as a growing number of influencers and companies market themselves on the platform, according to Professor Alan Woodward, a cyber security expert at the University of Surrey. He said the decision of the English Stamp Company not to engage with the hackers was ""brave"" but he said it was the right one. ""You shouldn't pay the ransom,"" he said. ""There's no guarantee you'll get the account back, the money will be used to fund further crime, and you'll just paint a big target on your back as a 'payer'."" Quite a lot of attacks of this nature rely on so-called  phishing emails  which try to trick users into revealing sensitive information, like usernames and passwords, by posing as a reputable website. ""Credential stuffing"" is another ploy used by hackers who use personal data, harvested elsewhere, to gain unauthorised access to accounts The best way to deal with an Instagram attack is to try to pre-empt it by beefing up your security beforehand, Professor Woodward said. Make sure passwords are strong, and don't reuse them across sites, he added. Instagram offers two-factor authentication by sending a code to your phone. People can check whether their usernames or passwords have been breached through a website called  haveibeenpwned.com , which is run by Troy Hunt, a Microsoft security expert. Facebook says Instagram is working with The English Stamp Company to try to recover their account as soon as possible. ""Businesses are an important part of our community and we take their safety and security seriously,"" the company said. ""We notify people if we see any unauthorised changes to an account and in the few instances hacking occurs, people can recover accounts through the app and website.""

However, it did not name the facility or say when the attack happened. A malicious link sent to staff at the facility eventually caused the shutdown ""of the entire pipeline asset"". It was so severe in part because the organisation was not prepared for such an attack, the DHS statement said. The incident was detailed  in a security alert. , which revealed it to be a ""spear-phishing"" attack, in which individuals are sent fraudulent but believable scam messages. That let the attacker into the company's IT network. How did that shut down a pipeline? Often, the ""operational network"" which runs computers in the factory is separated from the office IT - but not in this case, meaning the ransomware infection was allowed to spread. Ransomware typically encrypts files on a victim's computer and demands payment before offering to unlock them again - although there is no guarantee that the cyber-criminals who develop such software will be true to their word. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? A spate of ransomware attacks has troubled various US organisations recently - from  local authorities  to  hospitals  to  a maritime base . In the case of the natural gas facility, only one office was targeted, but others in different geographic locations were forced to close down, too. The DHS said the affected organisation had not properly prepared for a cyber-attack of this kind - with its emergency plans being focused on all sorts of physical attacks instead. ""Consequently, emergency response exercises also failed to provide employees with decision-making experience in dealing with cyber-attacks,"" the department added. All organisations, regardless of what sector they are in, should prepare for the possibility of a ransomware attack, said Carl Wearn, head of e-crime at cloud email firm Mimecast. Businesses could do this ""by implementing offline back-ups with a fall-back email and archiving facility, as a minimum"" he said.

Evil Corp hackers have tried to access at least 31 organisations' networks in order to cripple systems and demand millions of dollars in ransom. The group's two alleged leaders were indicted by the US Justice Department in December 2019. There are concerns that US voting systems could also be targeted. Last year, US authorities filed charges against Evil Corp's alleged leaders Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev, accusing them of using malware to steal millions of dollars from groups including schools and religious organisations in over 40 countries. Officials announced a $5m reward for information leading to their arrest, which they said was the largest amount ever offered for a cyber criminal. Both men are still at large.  image copyright US Department of Justice image caption Maksim Yakubets (L) and Igor Turashev are accused of running Evil Corp The threat comes as the majority of Americans have been working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic -  62%  according to a Gallup poll . The US presidential election is also just months away, and federal and local officials have been working to put measures in place to protect voter records as well as manage safe voting practices amid the pandemic. What do we know about the attack? Symantec Corporation, a firm that monitors corporate and government networks  released a notice warning of the threat  it identified on Thursday night. The attacks used what Symantec described as a relatively new type of ransomware called WastedLocker, which has been attributed to Evil Corp. Ransomware are computer viruses that threaten to delete files unless the ransom is paid. The WastedLocker ransomware virus demands ransoms of $500,000 to $1m to unlock computer files it seizes.  Symantec said the ""vast majority of targets are major corporations, including many household names"", and eight targets were Fortune 500 companies. All are US-owned but one, which is a US-based subsidiary. Most targeted companies were in the manufacturing, information technology and media sectors.  media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Symantec said the hackers had breached the networks of these companies and were ""laying the groundwork"" for future ransomware attacks that would let them block access to data and demand millions of dollars. Symantec technical director Eric Chien  told the New York Times  the hackers take advantage of employees now using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access work systems. They use VPNs to identify which company a user works for, and then infect the user's computer when they visit a public or commercial site. When the user next connects to their employer's system, the hackers can attack. What's the context? There have been a number of recent cyber-attacks on local governments across the US. Cities and towns in Louisiana, Oregon, Maryland, Georgia, Texas and Florida were hit by ransomware attacks last year.  The Department of Homeland Security is looking into safeguarding voter registration databases ahead of November 3's general election. In February, the agency's head of cyber-security  said this was a key election security concern . These attacks by foreign cyber-criminals are far from a new threat. During the impeachment inquiry last year, former White House security adviser and Russia expert Fiona Hill testified that ""Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election"". In 2018, the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections, using spear phishing emails and malicious software.  The hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board site. Moscow has said there is no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking.

Criminals were able to change payment details on a number of eBay listings, including for the iPhone 11. This enabled them to siphon money from unwitting customers who paid for goods via a PayPal account. Currys PC World, eBay and PayPal said all affected customers would be refunded. A spokesman for Dixons Carphone, which owns Currys PC World, said it was ""disappointed that this has happened"" and would work with eBay ""to investigate what has taken place"". The spokesman added: ""While we don't host this website, we are providing affected customers with guidance on how to obtain a refund from PayPal."" A spokesman for eBay said: ""The issue was resolved quickly and customers can continue to shop with full confidence."" PayPal said it was working to reverse any affected transactions. A spokesman said: ""If a customer has not seen their money refunded then they may need to raise an 'item not received' case via their PayPal account."" Fake accounts PayPal enables users to send and receive money using just an email address. Many shoppers use it to pay for items on eBay. Scammers stole from unwitting customers by setting up a fake PayPal account. The fraudsters used an email address that looked almost identical to Currys PC World's real account. After accessing the retailer's eBay account, they replaced the real email on listings with a fake one. Shoppers who thought they were paying Currys PC World for their goods were instead sending money to the fraudsters. image copyright Getty Images image caption Fraudsters targeted buyers of Apple's latest iPhone The attack happened on the weekend of October 19-20. It affected around 600 customers and potentially cost hundreds of thousands of pounds.  Refunds should appear in affected customers' accounts over the coming days. The company was also recently targeted by a separate phishing attack, according to  Mail Online , in which a fake eBay login page attempted to collect people's details. The Currys PC World website is unaffected. Protecting your account Cyber security expert Graham Cluley said the scam - known as a homograph attack - exploits the close similarity between two different characters or letters. He said: ""For instance, a lower case ""l"" for lima looks very much like an upper case ""I"" for India in many fonts. ""For years, scammers have been duping unsuspecting internet users into clicking on dangerous links by using this simple technique and, by the sound of things, are fooling users into paying the wrong PayPal accounts too."" Mr Cluley said the best way for people to stop scammers was to protect their accounts with two-factor authentication, which adds an extra layer of protection. ""You can also run a password manager which stores your passwords securely and protects against phishing attacks. And keep a close eye on your accounts for unusual transactions,"" he said.

phishing|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53214783|"How hackers extorted $1.14m from University of California, San Francisco By Joe Tidy Cyber reporter  Published 29 June 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images A leading medical-research institution working on a cure for Covid-19 has admitted it paid hackers a $1.14m (Â£910,000) ransom after a covert negotiation witnessed by BBC News. The Netwalker criminal gang attacked University of California San Francisco (UCSF) on 1 June. IT staff unplugged computers in a race to stop the malware spreading. And an anonymous tip-off enabled BBC News to follow the ransom negotiations in a live chat on the dark web. Cyber-security experts say these sorts of negotiations are now happening all over the world - sometimes for even larger sums - against the advice of law-enforcement agencies, including the FBI, Europol and the UK's National Cyber Security Centre.  Netwalker alone has been linked to at least two other ransomware attacks on universities in the past two months. image caption Netwalker's dark web website used for negotiations with victims At first glance, its dark-web homepage looks like a standard customer-service website, with a frequently asked questions (FAQ) tab, an offer of a ""free"" sample of its software and a live-chat option.  But there is also a countdown timer ticking down to a time when the hackers either double the price of their ransom, or delete the data they have scrambled with malware. Instructed to log in - either by email or a ransom note left on hacked computer screens - UCSF was met with the following message, posted on 5 June. Six hours later, the university asked for more time and for details of the hack to be removed from Netwalker's public blog. Noting UCSF made billions a year, the hackers then demanded $3m But the UCSF representative, who may be an external specialist negotiator, explained the coronavirus pandemic had been ""financially devastating"" for the university and begged them to accept $780,000.   After a day of back-and-forth negotiations, UCSF said it had pulled together all available money and could pay $1.02m - but the criminals refused to go below $1.5m. Hours later, the university came back with details of how it had procured more money and a final offer of $1,140,895.  And the next day, 116.4 bitcoins were transferred to Netwalker's electronic wallets and the decryption software sent to UCSF.    UCSF is now assisting the FBI with its investigations, while working to restore all affected systems. It told BBC News: ""The data that was encrypted is important to some of the academic work we pursue as a university serving the public good. ""We therefore made the difficult decision to pay some portion of the ransom, approximately $1.14 million, to the individuals behind the malware attack in exchange for a tool to unlock the encrypted data and the return of the data they obtained. ""It would be a mistake to assume that all of the statements and claims made in the negotiations are factually accurate."" image copyright iBrave image caption The hackers and the university negotiated in a live chat on the dark web But Jan Op Gen Oorth, from Europol, which runs a project called No More Ransom, said: ""Victims should not pay the ransom, as this finances criminals and encourages them to continue their illegal activities.  ""Instead, they should report it to the police so law enforcement can disrupt the criminal enterprise."" Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, said: ""Organisations in this situation are without a good option. ""Even if they pay the demand, they'll simply receive a pinky-promise that the stolen data will be deleted.  ""But why would a ruthless criminal enterprise delete data that it may be able to further monetise at a later date?"" Most ransomware attacks begin with a booby-trapped emaiI and research suggests criminal gangs are increasingly using tools that can gain access to systems via a single download. In the first week of this month alone, Proofpoint's cyber-security analysts say they saw more than one million emails with using a variety of phishing lures, including fake Covid-19 test results, sent to organisations in the US, France, Germany, Greece, and Italy.  Organisations are encouraged to regularly back-up their data offline. But Proofpoint's Ryan Kalember said: ""Universities can be challenging environments to secure for IT administrators. ""The constantly changing student population, combined with a culture of openness and information-sharing, can conflict with the rules and controls often needed to effectively protect the users and systems from attack.""

All new apps will be scanned by  malware-spotting tools from three cyber-security companies  as well as Google's own in-house system. Google said it needed help because the number of apps being uploaded was too large for it to handle alone. Nasty Play apps can hit lots of people. Malicious code found in June was in apps  downloaded 400 million times. Security companies Zimperium, Eset and Lookout will work together on what Google has called the App Defense Alliance. The four partners will set up a combined scanning system that will scrutinise apps as they pass through Google's pipeline on the way to being offered to Android users via the Play store. Working from massive databases of known malware, behavioural clues and machine-learning models of novel threats the scanners will look for trojans, adware, ransomware, banking malware and phishing attacks. ""On the malware side, we haven't really had a way to scale as much as we've wanted to scale,"" Dave Kleidermacher, Google's vice-president of  Android security, told Wired magazine. Mr Kleidermacher added there were so many apps being developed, even making a ""1% incremental improvement"" could make a difference.  The scanning system is the latest in a series of steps Google has taken in its bid to do a better job of policing the Play store.  In April, it announced more rigorous checks for developers  to root out ""bad faith"" coders  who produced and uploaded malicious or fraudulent apps.

The level of access they gained to the networks meant they could have shut them down had they wanted to. US-Israeli security firm Cybereason concluded ""with a high level of certainty"" that the hackers were based in China, probably sponsored by the government. The attack - dubbed Operation Softcell - began in 2017. Cybereason spotted the attacks in 2018 and helped one telecoms provider through four more over the next six months. It has now briefed more than a dozen others. None of the targeted firms or people has been named but,  according to the report , the hackers collected the call records and geo-location of various individuals from a selection of countries, including those in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The security firm identified changes in the pattern of attack and new activity every three or four months. The hackers gained entry to networks via a flaw in a web server product. 'Grist to the mill' Cybereason said the tools and techniques bore the hallmarks of Chinese hacking group APT10, which is widely believed to operate on behalf of the Chinese government. Security expert at the University of Surrey,  Prof Alan Woodward said the scale and audacity of the attacks was ""breathtaking"". ""The hackers used phishing attacks to get privileged access to networks and could potentially have closed them down. ""They could see who called whom, when, and also seem to have been able to track people's movements."" While US networks do not seem to be affected by this wave of attacks, they remain vulnerable and could have been targeted with different tools, said Prof Woodward. While there is no suggestion that Chinese firms played any part in the attacks, it will add ""grist to the mill"" for politicians calling for mobile operators to distance themselves from firms like Huawei, he added. In 2018, 30% of telecoms firms reported that sensitive customer data had been stolen in attacks.

Research suggests women across the world have shouldered more family and household responsibilities than men as the coronavirus pandemic continues, alongside their working lives. And they share their inspirations, frustrations but also their optimism. ""I have a new business and a new life,"" says Clare Muscutt, who lost work, her relationship and her flatmate as lockdown hit.  This Tuesday is Ada Lovelace Day - an annual celebration of women working in the male-dominated science, technology, engineering and maths (Stem) sectors. And, this year, it has a very different vibe. Varsha Amin, technology and digital skills coach, Hampshire image copyright @Shadz_ig  Initially it felt like business was paused. Confidence went.  I've now gone fully online. The tech is there to support it. And weirdly, I think I've benefited from it. I'm booking up months ahead.  The digital skills gap is costing the economy billions. People, and even entire corporations, are so far behind.  Then, you add in the complication of Covid. And you think everything is going to go backwards. But actually, digital is growing exponentially.  I'm dyslexic, so I have relied on tech to help get me where I am today. I'm a firm believer that tech can really enable anyone from anywhere to start their own business and make it fly. My husband is a neuroscientist. When Covid first hit, he was redeployed to the front line. And we had no childcare.  There were days when I sat in front of my laptop and cried. Getting the right balance is difficult. In September, my daughter started school. In the future, when she becomes more independent, I will go all out on my business. Jess Ratty - entrepreneur, technology public-relations company founder, Cornwall image copyright Jess Ratty There is absolutely no doubt that this has been the hardest year of my life.  I lost 40% of my business in two days, at the start of lockdown.  I had worked so hard to get to where I had got to. And I was filled with fury that a pandemic had taken it away. Every pitch we get, I throw as much energy at the screen as possible.  I find myself working longer hours to be more visible to my clients.  I am driven by this fear that next week I could lose another couple. But I have now got 60% more business back in. I'm used to working from home. But the biggest problem was having my eight-year-old daughter suddenly with me 24/7, when the schools closed.  We all knew it might come. But when it did, it happened so fast. It was really difficult having to work and do childcare at the same time.  Before lockdown, I would have said it was impossible. I'm embarrassed to say that she spent a lot of time watching Netflix and Disney+. But I am the breadwinner. And my partner was working full time on our house renovation because, until it was finished, we were living in a static caravan. I'm now launching a new business, this time in edtech [education technology]. I'm looking to do as many things as possible to protect those closest to me and prepare for the next ""impossible thing"" to happen.  Clare Muscutt, digital customer experience entrepreneur, Essex image copyright @willow.design.studio What I used to do doesn't exist anymore.  I had the life and career of my dreams. And I had left the corporate world to do it.  As soon as the pandemic hit, my diary just emptied.  The clients I had work booked with shut down any unnecessary spend.  Then, my relationship ended. My best friend moved out of our flat. And suddenly, the only contact I had with others was through Zoom.  I started having conversations with women in a similar field to me. And we started sharing how we were feeling. It made me think: ""How can I bring this style of conversation to the world, to help inspire others?"" And that led me into podcasting.  After a bad experience, I taught myself how to do the production. And it has led to me being paid to interview tech leaders elsewhere.  My bills are now getting paid. And the podcast is helping me to form an online community. Before the pandemic, I was living for the future - always looking forward to the next big event or trip away. Now, I don't know what the future holds or whether things will ever go back to the way they were. But if they don't, it's OK - I have a new business and a new life. Rebecca, cyber-security specialist, Ireland I have worked from home before. And at the start of lockdown, I didn't think it would be that much of a big deal. But it turned out that working from the kitchen table was very uncomfortable. Eventually, I finally got an old desk from a friend. And I was so happy.  Since lockdown began, I've seen quite a few cyber-security issues with phishing and invoice re-direction - when a malicious actor gets hold of a legitimate invoice and resends it but changes the bank details.  Sometimes, it's small amounts here and there, sometimes large amounts.  It's often difficult to recover the money. I'm also four months pregnant with our first child. I need new clothes. But if you go to the shop you can't try anything on. And I have no idea what size I am. Plus, I am limited in the times I can go out. I don't drive. It has to fit around work. And we can't go at busy times, because standing in long queues is so exhausting.  I feel like I've lost my independence.  In addition, they haven't yet figured out how they are going to hold antenatal classes.  I feel like I won't meet any other parents until my kid starts school. Claire Broadley, technical writer, Leeds image copyright Mathew Dixon Before lockdown, my husband and I ran our own company, producing user guides and written content for websites. Business income dropped by about two-thirds during lockdown.  We weren't eligible for any government grants. And because we still had a small amount of work, we couldn't furlough ourselves.  It felt like we were slowly marching our family towards a cliff edge.  In May, to my astonishment and relief, I was offered my dream job, remote writing about the internet and technology. Working from home with the children has been the most difficult thing we've ever done.  My son is seven. He is very scared.  Sometimes, we can't spend the time with him that we would like to. And most screen-time rules have gone completely out of the window.  The real issue for us now is testing.  My young daughter caught Covid in July. And she recently had a temperature again. But it took six days to get a test result, so my son was off school again. And my husband was working until midnight to fit everything in. Suw Charman-Anderson, founder, Ada Lovelace Day, US  image copyright Paul Clarke For Ada Lovelace Day, we usually hold a cabaret-style event in central London. Instead, we are holding five free webinars and have organised a 50-hour online extravaganza, with blog and social media posts and a YouTube playlist.  In November, we're running our first online conference, which will span 29 time zones.    I've had to find and evaluate livestreaming services and conference platforms, something that I've never had to consider before.  It's been quite stressful working out how to run our online events affordably and dealing with the additional work involved.  Our income has been badly affected by the pandemic as companies have less money to spend on event sponsorship, so we're also having to think about how we're going to make up that shortfall.  Despite that, I'm really excited by what we're doing.  Covid forced us to rethink everything. And some of the changes we've made may become permanent.  2020 has been a hard slog. And we're not out of the woods yet. But I hope we'll emerge stronger and able to reach and support more women in Stem.

UK Finance has warned that scamsters are preying on consumers' financial fears and has named ten Covid-19 scams the public should be wary of. ""Criminals are impersonating trusted organisations like the NHS or HMRC to trick people,"" the trade body said. People should stay alert to avoid falling for the sophisticated schemes, it said. ""During this pandemic we have seen criminals using sophisticated methods to callously exploit people's financial concerns to trick them into giving away their money or information,"" said Katy Worobec, managing director of economic crime at UK Finance. Local councils have recorded a 40% increase in reported scams since the start of lockdown, while Citizens Advice reckons one in three people have been targeted by a Covid scammer. Taxpayers to lose billions to virus fraud - report Scam warning over NHS test and trace Fake lockdown fines among scams targeting public Some scams manipulate their victims by urging people to invest and ""take advantage of the financial downturn"".  Others impersonate well-known subscription services to trick people to part with their cash and personal information. Some criminals even pose as representatives from the NHS test and trace service to fool people into giving away their personal details. ""We urge people to follow the advice of the Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign to keep their money and personal information safe from fraudsters,"" said Ms Worobec. The campaign encourages people to be suspicious of any unsolicited contact and ""Stop, Challenge and Protect"" when they receive any messages out of the blue. The ten scams to be wary of Covid-19 financial support scams 1. Fake government emails, which look like they are from government departments offering grants of up to Â£7,500. The emails contain links which steal personal and financial information. 2. Scam emails offering access to ""Covid-19 relief funds"", which encourage victims to fill in a form and hand over their personal information. 3. Official-looking emails offering a ""council tax reduction"". The emails contain links that lead to a fake government website, which harvests personal and financial information. 4. Benefit recipients are offered help in applying for universal credit, but fraudsters grab some of the payment as an advance for their ""services"". Health scams 5. Phishing emails claiming that the recipient has been in contact with someone diagnosed with Covid-19. They lead to fake websites that are used to steal personal and financial information or infect devices with malware. 6. Fake adverts for non-existent coronavirus-related products, such as hand sanitizer and face masks, which simply take the victim's cash and send them nothing. Lockdown scams 7. Fake emails and texts claiming to be from TV Licensing, telling people they are eligible for six months for free because of the pandemic. Victims are told there has been a problem with their direct debit and are asked to click on a link that takes them to a fake website, which steals their personal and financial information. 8. Emails asking people to update their TV subscription services payment details by clicking on a link which is then used to steal credit card information. 9. Fake profiles on social media sites are used to manipulate victims into handing over their money. Criminals will often use the identities of real people to strike up conversation with their targets.  10. Fake investment opportunities are advertised on social media sites, encouraging victims to ""take advantage of the financial downturn"". Bitcoin platforms are using emails and adverts on social media platforms to encourage unsuspecting victims to put money into fake companies using fake websites. Be cautious The Local Government Association (LGA) also warned about fake coronavirus test kits and hand sanitizers, but said scamsters are also flogging medical products claiming to treat or prevent Covid-19. It said local councils have also heard of messages about how to claim school meals funding and government grants, and criminals cold-calling care home residents offering to do shopping errands. One scam involves a message sent by text or email stating that the recipient has been fined Â£60 for leaving their home more than once a day, the LGA warned. Links in these messages connect to websites that steal a victim's personal information or hack into their computer or phone. ""People need to be cautious. If something doesn't seem right or sounds too good to be true, don't hesitate to end a phone call, bin a letter, delete an email or shut the door,"" an LGA spokesperson said. Citizens Advice warned that the most vulnerable people are often at greater risk of being contacted by a scammer. Dame Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""While so many people have pulled together to help and support each other through the challenges of coronavirus, opportunistic scammers have instead chosen to prey on unsuspecting victims. ""We've had nearly a quarter of a million views of our web pages on scams during this pandemic and we're urging everyone to only use trusted sources of information and be on the lookout for signs of a potential scam."" The charity's research showed almost half those with a disability or long-term illness had been targeted, while half of those with an increased risk of Covid-19 or those shielding had been too. More than half of those who have lost personal income due to the virus had also been contacted.

The scam used a fake gov.uk address, but the messages were prevented from ever reaching their intended recipients. The details were revealed by GCHQ's  National Cyber Security Centre in an annual report . In all, NCSC disclosed it had stopped 140,000 separate phishing attacks. This refers to the attempted online theft of bank details and other sensitive information by impersonating a trustworthy person or organisation. In addition, the agency said it had taken down 190,000 fraudulent sites.  This often happened quickly. The centre said that 64% of illegal sites were offline within 24 hours of being discovered and 99.3% eventually went dark. This is the second time NCSC has published a progress report for its Active Cyber Defence programme. The effort - which uses a mix of automated processes to defeat internet-based threats to the UK - was launched in late-2016. One focus is to take down malware and phishing sites. This is normally done by finding out who hosts the websites involved and then telling them that their clients are running a criminal operation. Most providers take down the pages quickly, although there are some exceptions.   No such address NCSC has not shared the name of the airport the fraudsters attempted to impersonate last August. But it did say that the failed scheme involved sending 200,000 emails to members of the public asking them to pay a fee in order to receive a larger refund.  Had the intended victims paid the sum, they would have got nothing in return. UK cyber-security efforts criticised by audit office UK cyber-centre thwarts hostile hackers UK moves to 'active cyber-defence' The security centre also took the criminals' real email address offline to ensure they could not receive any replies. Another success was an apparent reduction in the number of attacks in which fraudsters had posed as HM Revenue and Customs. Scammers often pretend to offer individuals tax refunds if victims provide bank accounts and a facilitation payment.   At the start of January 2016, HMRC was the 16th most popular disguise used in phishing emails. By the end of 2019, a series of new measures had reduced its global ranking to 146th. Address book block Efforts were also made to prevent 1.4 million employees in the public sector from visiting malicious sites.  This involved a service  known as PDNS (protective domain name system) , which effectively refuses to query the internet's address book when appropriate. So, for example, if a user typed in a web address whose domain name had previously been linked to illegal activity -  eg dodgysite.com - the service would refuse to provide the related internet protocol address - eg 216.58.111.789 - required to connect to its computer servers. NCSC said that PDNS had handled a total of 68.7 billion queries in 2018, of which it had blocked 57.4 million.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The PDNS system prevents connections to computer servers that are known to host ransomware, phishing attacks and malicious sites This included frustrating 450,000 queries related to WannaCry - the malware that took down parts of the NHS in 2018. A further 230,000 queries were obstructed relating to another piece of malware called BadRabbit. The system even found evidence  of attempts to spread the Conficker worm , which was released as far back as 2008. NCSC added that BT has been working on its own version of PDNS, and is blocking an average of 110 million malicious connections per month. Weather centre Other incidents flagged by the report included: a primary school being involved in the spread of a large-scale malware infection because its anti-virus system was not working an unnamed public sector organisation that deals with sensitive information getting breached because its employees had downloaded unauthorised software at least 318 public sector networks still routinely using Windows XP despite Microsoft having pulled nearly all support for the operating system in 2014 In the future, the NCSC said it wanted to do more to map the UK's use of the internet, in a piece of research it calls the Internet Weather Centre.  The aim is to understand questions like what are the most commonly used cloud services, and then use that knowledge to understand related vulnerabilities.  It also wants to do more work to allow public sector users to scan and check how their infrastructure is exposed to the net to spot potential risks.

The researchers who first discovered the database told the BBC that it contained more information than Virgin Media suggested. Such details could be used by cyber-criminals to extort victims. Virgin Media told the BBC only a small number of customers had these sensitive details in the database. The UK telecoms company revealed on Thursday that one of its ""marketing databases"" containing details of 900,000 people was open to the internet and had been accessed ""on at least one occasion"" by an unknown user. On Friday, it confirmed that the database contained details of about 1,100 customers who had used an online form to ask for a particular website to be blocked or unblocked.  It said it was in the process of contacting customers again about specific data that may have been stolen. When it first confirmed the data breach on Thursday, Virgin Media warned the public that the database contained phone numbers, home addresses and emails. However, researchers at cyber-security firm TurgenSec - which found the database - said it contained more intimate details. ""Stating to their customers that there was only a breach of 'limited contact information' is from our perspective understating the matter potentially to the point of being disingenuous,"" one researcher told the BBC. ""These highly sensitive details could be used by cyber-criminals to boost the chances of extorting money from victims."" Virgin Media said the database did not ""provide information as to what, if anything, was viewed"" by affected customers. The company said almost all of those affected were Virgin customers with television or fixed-line telephone accounts, although the database also included some Virgin Mobile customers as well as potential customers referred by friends as part of a promotion. It added that all individuals had been given details on how to contact the company for support and advice.  A representative of TurgenSec said Virgin Media's security had been far from adequate.  ""The information was in plain text and unencrypted, which meant anyone browsing the internet could clearly view and potentially download all of this data without needing any specialised equipment, tools, or hacking techniques,"" they told the BBC. Virgin Media, which is owned by US cable group Liberty Global, said it took security very seriously. It said it had informed the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) of the data breach, as required.  A spokeswoman for the ICO said it was investigating, and added: ""People have the right to expect that organisations will handle their personal information securely and responsibly. When that doesn't happen, we advise people who may have been affected by data breaches to be vigilant when checking their financial records."" Virgin Media said it would be emailing those affected, in order to warn them about the risks of phishing, nuisance calls and identity theft. The message will include a reminder not to click on unknown links in emails, and not to provide personal details to unverified callers.

phishing|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-53428304|"Twitter hack: What went wrong and why it matters By Joe Tidy Cyber reporter  Published 16 July 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing There are a lot of unanswered questions about the Twitter hack on Wednesday night - but one thing most agree on is it could have been far worse.  Potentially thousands of people were scammed out of money after hijacked accounts of prominent verified users promised to double the money fans sent them in the cryptocurrency Bitcoin.  Using Twitter's internal systems, the cyber-criminals' messages had a reach of at least 350 million people. And it looks like it made them about $110,000 (Â£86,800) in the few hours that the scam was active. Huge engagement It was an unprecedented attack on privacy, trust and security.  But experts say the hackers could have caused far more damage. As the boss of a smaller messaging service put it: ""Thank God for greed."" Twitter has huge engagement in the US, Japan, Russia and the UK.  Valid questions It is the platform of choice for some of the most powerful and prominent people in the world.  Their posts have moved financial markets and caused diplomatic incidents. With the US presidential election less than four months away, there are now valid questions to be asked about whether Twitter can be relied upon in the lead up to the vote. President Donald Trump's account was not taken over in the hack. 'Favourite tools' But many were watching to see if it would fall after his Democrat rival Joe Biden's account tweeted out the scam. image caption Presidential hopefuls Mike Bloomberg, who had sought the Democratic nomination, and Kanye West, who has said he will run as an independent, were among those hacked ""We already know Russia is planning to meddle in the 2020 election just as they did in the 2016 election,"" Dr Heather Williams, from King's College London, said. ""Social-media manipulation is one of their favourite tools. ""So this hack shows just how vulnerable social-media platforms are and how vulnerable Americans are to disinformation.  ""If something bigger was at stake, such as the presidency, this could have really disastrous consequences and undermine our democratic processes."" 'Worst in history' The security implications of the hack are also wide-reaching, not just for Twitter but for all social networks Early suggestions are the hackers managed to access administration privileges, which allowed them to bypass the passwords of any account they wanted. Twitter appeared  to confirm this in a tweet saying : ""We detected what we believe to be a co-ordinated social-engineering attack by people who successfully targeted some of our employees with access to internal systems and tools."" image caption Celebrities including US boxer Floyd Mayweather and the singer Wiz Khalifa also lost control of their accounts ""Social-engineering"" could mean one of several things. Go rogue It might imply a targeted phishing operation - a common tactic employed by cyber-criminals, who find out which individuals have the keys to a system they want to enter and then target them with personal emails that trick them into handing over details. Or it might mean the perpetrators managed to convince one or several staff members to go rogue, by offering a financial inducement or other means. Major US Twitter accounts hacked in Bitcoin scam The Benjamin Netanyahu Twitter hack that never was The technology company is going to face huge pressure to be more specific. ""Twitter's reputation is the cost of this cyber-attack,"" World Economic Forum cyber lead William Dixon said. ""This is a major security breach for Twitter.  ""The worst in its history. ""More cyber-resilience is needed across the ecosystem to be able to protect social media users around the world."" 'Sensitive information' Twitter is not answering reporters' questions directly but said it had taken ""significant steps to limit access to internal systems"" while it investigated. The company also said it was ""looking into what other malicious activity [the hackers] may have conducted or information they may have accessed"". The chief executive of the messaging service Element has raised the possibility confidential data was also exposed. ""It's highly likely private direct messages were accessible for a short time,"" Matthew Hodgson said. ""Next time, harvesting sensitive information could fuel a wave of extortion or something much worse."" image caption Technology companies Apple and Uber have more than 5.5 million Twitter followers between them The idea Twitter has the ability to take over people's accounts no matter what security they have may shock some. But experts say it is a necessary part of any membership-based service. Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram and YouTube have been approached for comment on their security arrangements.  None has responded. 'High-risk accounts' But Facebook's former chief security officer Alex Stamos told BBC News all consumer-facing companies needed a way to be able to help consumers recover hacked or otherwise locked-out accounts. ""The change that can be made here is that Twitter can restrict this ability for high-risk accounts to a much smaller number of users or create tools that require one person to initiate and another to approve the change,"" he said. ""This is, apparently, what they have already done for President Trump's account, following an incident in 2017.  ""They will need to vastly expand these protections."" Lost control Beyond a potential loss of trust, Twitter may now face legal consequences too. The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) says organisations such as Twitter have to show ""appropriate"" levels of security. And if data-protection officers judge Twitter failed to take adequate measures to protect European users, it could be fined. Earlier this year, the company's chief executive, Jack Dorsey, lost control of his account for 20 minutes. And in 2010, Twitter settled with the Federal Trade Commission after it was alleged hackers had obtained unauthorised administrative control, including the ability to send out phony tweets from then-President-elect Barack Obama and Fox News.

Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said the dozen accused used spear phishing emails and malicious software. He said the hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board website. The Kremlin said there was no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking. The claims were ""an old duck"" and a ""heap of conspiracy schemes"", said Moscow's foreign ministry in a statement. Friday's indictment was the first by US officials to directly charge Russia's government with meddling in the US vote two years ago. Four intriguing lines in Mueller charges Who's who in Russia-Trump drama? What are the allegations? The 11-count indictment names  the Russians defendants, alleging they began cyber-attacks in March 2016 on the email accounts of staff for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Mr Rosenstein said the defendants corresponded with several Americans during the alleged conspiracy, but added there is no allegation that any US citizen committed a crime. The deputy attorney general said the conspirators used fictitious online personas, including ""DCLeaks"" and ""Guccifer 2.0"", to release thousands of stolen emails beginning in June 2016. They also plotted to hack into the computers of state boards of elections, secretaries of state, and voter software, according to the indictment. Mr Rosenstein said: ""We know that the goal of the conspirators was to have an impact on the election."" The deputy attorney general said all 12 defendants were in the Russian intelligence service, the GRU. A guide to US legalese All you need to know about Mueller inquiry What did the hackers find out? The DNC leak showed that top Democrats preferred Mrs Clinton for the presidential nomination, which confirmed the worst fears among supporters of her liberal challenger, Bernie Sanders. Clinton campaign manager John Podesta's emails were also hacked, which contained details of infighting and aides' disparaging remarks about Mrs Clinton. 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Why US fears Russia is hacking election Shadow over Trump-Putin summit Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News If the Russian military had dropped a bomb on the headquarters of a US political party, it would be an act of war. Same if it had launched a missile at the home of the chair of a US presidential campaign.  This isn't what happened, of course, but make no mistake, what the US Department of Justice is alleging - a cyber-attack by Russian military officers against a US political party and its leaders - is, or at least should be, equally inflammatory. The wreckage of what Robert Mueller's team says were Russian strikes on the US can be measured in damaged reputations and disrupted politics.  Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein denies that Friday's announcement had anything to do with Donald Trump's upcoming meeting with Vladimir Putin - but they will cast a shadow over the summit nevertheless.  After days of sharply criticising US allies, the world will closely watch how the president handles allegations of ""virtual"" warfare against the US when he sits down with the man whose military is accused of being behind it all. What has Trump said? President Donald Trump was briefed about the indictments earlier in the week. He is currently in the UK, from where he once again dismissed the investigation as a ""rigged witch hunt"".  During a joint news conference with British Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday, Mr Trump also said the Russia collusion allegations dogging his presidency were ""pure stupidity"". Next week he will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit in Helsinki, Finland. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer has urged the president to cancel that meeting, in light of the indictment. media caption Putin laughs at political chaos in US What's the big picture? Special Counsel Robert Mueller is investigating US intelligence findings that Russians conspired to tilt the election in Mr Trump's favour, and whether any of his campaign aides colluded. As of Friday, the inquiry has indicted 32 people - mostly Russian nationals in absentia - as well as three companies and four former Trump advisers. None of the charges allege Trump advisers colluded with Russia to interfere with the presidential campaign. Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, a former foreign policy adviser, have pleaded guilty to making false statements about their contacts with Russians. Former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and his deputy Rick Gates were charged with money laundering relating to their political consultancy work in Ukraine.

A car crashed into a security barrier before the driver lunged towards the officers with a knife, police said.  The officers opened fire and the suspect was shot dead. Authorities said the attack, which came three months after  January's deadly Capitol riots , did not appear to be terrorism-related. ""Whether the attack was at law enforcement, or whoever, we have a responsibility to get to the bottom of it and we'll do that,"" Robert Contee, the acting chief of Washington DC's Metropolitan Police Department, said at a news conference. Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said it was ""with a very, very heavy heart that I announce one of our officers has succumbed to his injuries"". As it happened: Police officer killed in attack on US Capitol In a later statement, she named the officer as  William ""Billy"" Evans, who had been a member of the Capitol Police for 18 years and was part of the department's first responders unit. ""Please keep Officer Evans and his family in your thoughts and prayers,"" she said.  image copyright US Capitol Police image caption The officer killed in the attack has been named as William ""Billy"" Evans Two law enforcement sources involved in the investigation told BBC partner CBS News that the suspect in the attack was 25-year-old Noah Green from Indiana.  They said that no prior information about him had been found on any police databases. In a post from mid-March on a now-deleted Facebook page, Green wrote that he had recently left his job, ""partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey"".   He added he had been suffering the ""side effects of drugs I was intaking unknowingly"" and wrote extensively of his interest in the black nationalist religious organisation, Nation of Islam. In a statement Facebook said it had designated the incident under its ""Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy"", meaning the suspect's Facebook and Instagram accounts were being removed, as well as any content praising him. An increased security presence remains around the Capitol building, where the US Congress sits. As Congress is not currently in session, most politicians were not at the Capitol complex at the time of the attack.  What do we know about the attack? Shortly after 13:00 local time (18:00 GMT) the Capitol Police alert system sent an email to lawmakers and their staff ordering them to stay away from exterior windows and doors due to a threat. Anyone outside was instructed to seek cover.   At that time, a man driving a blue sedan had rammed the car into two officers standing at the North Barricade, according to police. He exited the vehicle and ran towards the officers - at least one of whom drew a weapon and shot the suspect. The officers were then transported to hospital, one in an ambulance and one in a police cruiser. image copyright EPA Footage of the scene showed a helicopter flying overhead and what appeared to be two people on stretchers being moved into ambulances.  Onlookers were told to clear the area.  Police said the suspect died due to his injuries at 13:30 local time. Chief Contee told reporters the suspect appeared to act alone. The FBI's Washington Field Office said it was providing support to the Capitol Police. A second attack in less than three months Analysis by Samantha Granville, US Capitol Capitol Hill has been tense over the past three months. Since the riot on 6 January, the complex has been like a fortress with barbed wire, metal fencing and heightened security.  But just weeks later, we are back here with blocked roads, extra troops, and a solemn feeling. Congress is in recess today and staff I have spoken to are grateful to be home and nervous about returning to work after the Easter holiday.  They say, understandably, that it is scary to have your workplace attacked twice in a short space of time. It is concerning for them that even with ramped up security, an event that led to an officer's death still happened. What has the reaction been? US President Joe Biden said he was ""heartbroken to learn of the violent attack"". He offered his ""heartfelt condolences to Officer Evans' family, and everyone grieving his loss"", and said that he had ordered flags at the White House to be lowered to half mast. Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi said ""America's heart has been broken"" and called Mr Evans ""a martyr for our democracy"". image copyright Reuters Democratic Senate majority leader Chuck Schumer said he was ""heartbroken for the officer killed"" and indebted to the Capitol police force.

Police said an explosion erupted as two attackers tried to enter the church on Palm Sunday ahead of Easter. A destroyed motorbike and body parts were found at the scene and police said the two attackers had died. Militant Islamists have attacked churches in the past but no group has yet said it was behind the bombing. Indonesia's President Joko Widodo condemned the attack as ""act of terror"" and said he had ordered the chief of police to investigate those responsible. ""I call on everyone to fight against terror and radicalism, which go against religious values,"" the president said. Religious Affairs Minister Yaqut Cholil Qoumas urged police to increase security measures at places of worship. During a Palm Sunday mass at the Vatican, Pope Francis offered a prayer for the victims of the attack. What do we know about the attack? The explosion happened at about 10:30 local time (03:30 GMT) at the end of a service for Palm Sunday, the first day of Holy Week before Easter. ""There were two people riding on a motorbike when the explosion happened at the main gate of the church - the perpetrators were trying to enter the compound,"" National Police spokesman Argo Yuwono said. Later, the country's chief security minister, Mahfud MD, described the attack as ""a suicide bombing"" committed by two people, both of whom had died. image copyright Reuters image caption Body parts were found at the scene of the bomb attack A priest at the church, Father Wilhemus Tulak, told Metro TV that security guards had tackled one suspected bomber. The attacker, he said, arrived by motorbike and tried to get into the church. Police said at least 14 people were injured, including the church officials who stopped the attackers from entering the cathedral. The blast happened by the church's side entrance. Footage from security cameras showed fire, smoke and debris being blown into the middle of the road. Makassar Mayor Danny Pomanto said that if the explosion had happened at the main entrance, it could have led to far more casualties. ""There were several injured people on the street. I helped one woman who was wounded and covered in blood,"" one witness named only as Yosi told the AFP news agency. ""Her grandchild was also injured. There were body parts everywhere.""

The Manchester Arena Inquiry was told the former police control room manager accepted his staff did not communicate well with responders after the blast. Ch Insp Mike Booth said his belief that staff had enough support to deal with such an attack had been ""incorrect"". He was not on duty on the night of the 2017 attack. The inquiry has been told that it was the police's job to inform and update other  responders during a major incident, such as the bombing, which killed 22 people and injured hundreds more. 'Key element' Giving evidence, Ch Insp Booth said he ""would have hoped"" staff in the control room ""would have been aware of the responsibilities"". ""Clearly, with hindsight, some further embedding of that would have been extremely useful,"" he said. ""I maintain that at the time I believed the additional support available to them would have been sufficient. ""Clearly, as it's played out in a real-life incidentâ¦ my original assumption proved to be incorrect."" image copyright Family handouts image caption Twenty-two people died in the attack on 22 May 2017 However, he said he did not think the importance of triggering other emergency responders ""fell off the radar"". He said police first aid skills were ""limited compared to those of fire and ambulance service, so certainly they were and remain a key element of responding to a major incident"". ""We realise we can't do it all ourselves,"" he added. Pete Weatherby QC, who represents some of the bereaved families, asked him if the police's preoccupation with getting armed officers to the scene of the arena attack came to the detriment of involving other emergency services in the response.  ""It appears that way, yes,"" he replied. 'Level best' The inquiry heard that in November 2016, inspectors found there were shortcomings in how Greater Manchester Police (GMP) control room staff would be able to cope in the event of a terrorist attack.  Ch Insp Booth said his seniors did not tell him the specific findings of that inspection report and if had been ""aware of the lack of knowledge... then obviously I could have reflected on what other activity could have taken place to bolster that knowledge"". The hearing was also told that in the year before the bombing, Ch Insp Booth created ""action cards"" which gave police control room staff simple clear reminders of what they needed to do during a terrorist attack. The idea was that the cards would help take the pressure off the police force duty officer (FDO), who is initially responsible for co-ordinating the emergency response to any major incident.  The hearing was told that despite him doing his ""level best"", nothing was done within Greater Manchester Police to make sure the action cards were used by control room staff.

The funeral attracted 2,000 mourners when Covid restrictions were in place. The actions of 24 Sinn FÃ©in politicians who attended were examined, including Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.

By Dominic Casciani Home affairs correspondent Published 3 February 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images A man shot dead by officers on Sunday, during what police called an Islamist-related terrorist incident, had been out of prison for about a week. So, what is done in prisons to deradicalise people like  Sudesh Amman, who stabbed people on Streatham High Street? What do we know of Amman's past?  Amman, 20, served half of a sentence of three years and four months for terror offences. He pleaded guilty in November 2018 to six charges of possessing documents containing information useful to terrorists - and seven of passing them on. The documents included a ""manual"" on knife fighting.  Before he was jailed, Amman had convictions for having a broken bottle as an offensive weapon and possessing cannabis. What's done to deradicalise terror offenders?  A programme called Healthy Identities Intervention (HII) is the UK's main in-prison scheme to challenge the thinking of terrorism offenders.  After the 2019 Fishmongers' Hall attack, the creator of the 10-year-old scheme, forensic psychologist Chris Dean, told the BBC  there is no certainty all terrorism offenders can be reformed. It aims to get offenders to think carefully, often over a very long series of counselling sessions, why they chose to turn to terrorist violence. They are asked whether the violence, or support of it, defines their identity.  image copyright Met Police image caption Amman had previous convictions for having an offensive weapon and possessing cannabis In some cases, an offender may turn away from violence quickly. But it is often more difficult when prisoners who have spent years in jail, or supporting banned organisations, are involved. In the case of those aligned to jihadist organisations, prison service imams also get involved in religious counselling sessions. These have been criticised for using chaplains without the detailed knowledge of jihadist ideology required to break down extremist beliefs.  How many prisoners take part? In theory, every prisoner convicted of a terrorism-related crime is eligible to attend HII sessions, or similar schemes.  Some refuse to co-operate and others may not need specialist intervention because they have found their own way to change for the better.  It is not clear whether the prison service has sufficient resources in place for all the prisoners who may want to take part.  Prof Andrew Silke, another expert in the field, said last year there were waiting lists and  some offenders never get seen before their release date. How many people are in prison for terror offences? Who was the Streatham attacker? Why do prisoners serve only half their sentence? How successful are these programmes?  We don't know. Mr Dean told the BBC that HII had seen successes. However, there were also hard cases because of the psychological hold that other extremists, or an ideology, had over the life of an inmate.  The HII programme has not been independently evaluated. One reason is it would be unethical to carry out a scientific trial in which some offenders are released without receiving therapy, just to see if they were most likely to reoffend.  In 2015, the then Justice Secretary Michael Gove asked Ian Acheson, a former prison governor, to review how extremism was being handled. Mr Acheson concluded that the system was full of flaws.  How often do convicts pose a danger after release?  This is the second time that a convicted terrorism offender has come out of jail and carried out an attack, leading to their death at the hands of armed police.  Usman Khan was shot dead by police  after he killed two people and injured three others in December's attack  at Fishmonger's Hall, London Bridge.  The police have successfully caught other suspects who continue to plot after their release - including  a cell in Birmingham who were uncovered planning a marauding knife attack in the city . What do other countries do?  Some nations separate Islamist extremist prisoners in jails, to prevent radicalisation.   The Acheson review found that in the Netherlands, Spain and France the separation of extremist offenders had worked well. It had improved prison safety and order. That, in turn, had helped the authorities to better target counter-radicalisation schemes at those who would most benefit.  The UK only recently began operating so-called ""separation units"" for the highest risk detainees. However, there have been reports of disagreement within the prison service over whether they are being properly used. Saudi Arabia claims to have had the most success, targeting 3,300 inmates since 2005. The authorities there claim an 80% success rate - with the remaining 20% returning to violence.  The offenders go through a number of stages:  Counselling in prison before entering a specialist rehabilitation facility Intensive cognitive behaviour programmes - aimed at addressing the way they think and respond to situations Introduction to a wider range of art, cultural, sporting and religious activities to help them return to normal life and society ""After care"" once they are back in society Related Topics Anti-terror legislation Prisons Crime More on this story How many people are in prison for terror offences?

By Rebecca Seales BBC News Published 20 December 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright CBS image caption Dog-mauling victim Bethany Stephens was found dead in Virginia In Virginia, US, a young woman has died in tragic circumstances after being mauled by her own dogs. Police said Bethany Stephens, 22, was attacked by her two pit bulls while out for a walk - despite having raised them since they were puppies. Locals were so shocked by the case that the sheriff had to release disturbing details of her death  to convince them the dogs were responsible. What would make a dog turn on its owner so dramatically?  Experts say it's still unclear. But generally speaking, there are several factors that make dogs lash out. Here are some to be aware of. They don't like stress... or Christmas Sean Wensley, Senior Veterinary Surgeon at the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals (PDSA), says dogs can be aggressive when they feel threatened. ""The motivation for lots of dog bites is fear,"" he says. ""Others are territorial - if they're guarding something that they highly value, or defending their favourite resting place, their bed... Or if they've learned to defend, say, a dog bowl - that can result in aggression."" Dog behaviourist and trainer Carolyn Menteith notes that many dog bites occur during the holiday season, and often it's not their owner they snap with. ""Christmas can make it worse as people ask people to just stay with their dog while they pop to the shops,"" she says. A houseful of guests descend, excited children are around all day, and walks may fall by the wayside, leaving the dog bored and confused. image copyright Getty Images image caption Christmas can be a confusing time for our canine companions (picture for representation) ""We're a very verbal species, so when we're not feeling comfortable, we say something,"" Ms Menteith says. ""Our dogs only have body language cues to do that with."" It's easy to miss what they're trying to tell us, especially with a long list of undone Christmas chores.  Look for signs of pain Regardless of the time of year, owners with more than one dog should check how they behave to each other. ""If there's competitive behaviour between them, that can lead to aggression between the dogs that can potentially be directed at an owner,"" Dr Wensley says.   A generally pleasant dog is more likely to attack if it's in pain - for example if it's encouraged to move out of a doorway, and that tweaks a painful joint. image copyright Getty Images image caption Dogs can be aggressive because they're scared - and may even go and hide after biting people (file picture shows a dog in training). Liver disease - which affects the brain - and brain tumours can also cause animals to behave unpredictably. Mind the children NHS figures for 2014-15 showed that 7,227 people needed medical attention after being ""bitten or struck"" by a dog, with young children the most commonly affected. Some 1,159 under the age of nine were admitted to hospital. Research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) found that 76% of dog bites to children were to the lips, nose or cheeks , because of their height. Bites to the neck are especially dangerous as a child can bleed to death if their carotid artery is severed. Dr Wensley says children are potentially alarming for inexperienced dogs. ""A small human who behaves slightly unusually, who maybe squeals and tries to cuddle them, pick them up, wave their hands... can make them quite fearful,"" he says.  Woman, 80, jailed over dog attack Dog attack powers 'not being used' How effective is the UK's Dangerous Dogs Act? Before biting, dogs will usually show several signs of anxiety. They may lick their lips, adopt a low posture, put their ears back, and potentially have their tail under their legs. Children may be unable to read those signals - and many even think a dog baring its teeth is smiling. media caption Katy Hastings reports Ms Menteith says that when a dog does attack, the owner will often say it bit with no warning. But in its own way, the dog has been trying to say something for months. ""We take dogs into our lives, and then we don't listen to them as dogs,"" she says. Training is a good investment When thinking about whether it's safe to leave your dog with children, or adult strangers, consider its past experiences. Is it used to small people? Can you really trust it to behave without you? ""A problem we see is when young puppies aren't exposed to everyday sights and sounds,"" Dr Wensley says. ""Perhaps they've been reared on a puppy farm in the middle of nowhere, or in a very rural location, and then someone buys them off the internet, meets them at a motorway services, and they're taken to an urban family environment and expected to understand the world they find themselves in.  ""They can be extremely anxious and fearful, and that will manifest as aggression.""  Early training is also key to avoiding future aggression - and it's best to start while they're still puppies.

Hackers claim to have breached Verkada, a security company that provides cameras to companies including Tesla. Bloomberg reported  feeds from prisons, psychiatric hospitals, clinics, and Verkada's own offices were hijacked. Verkada told the BBC it was ""investigating the scale and scope of this issue"". The company added it had notified law enforcement. However, it did not confirm the size and scale of the attack. Reuters has also reported  that the transport start-up Virgin Hyperloop was among the list of impacted user accounts disclosed by the hackers. Software provider Cloudflare told the BBC that it had been alerted to a ""handful"" of cameras that might have been compromised at its offices around the world. A Verkada camera inside a Florida hospital, reportedly seen by Bloomberg, showed what appeared to be eight workers tackling a man and pinning him to a bed.  Another video showed officers in a police station in Stoughton, Massachusetts questioning a man in handcuffs.  One, inside a Tesla warehouse in Shanghai, showed people working on an assembly line. The BBC has not been able to independently verify these videos.  'Too much fun' The hackers also said they had gained access to the security cameras of Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed more than 20 people in 2012. Speaking to Bloomberg, Tille Kottmann claimed credit for hacking into Verkada's systems.  The reasons for the hack, Kottmann said, were, ""lots of curiosity, fighting for freedom of information and against intellectual property, a huge dose of anti-capitalism, a hint of anarchism - and it's also just too much fun not to do it"". The attack was reportedly unsophisticated, involving use of a ""super admin"" account to gain access to Verkada. Bloomberg said that after they had contacted Verkada, the hackers lost access to the video feeds and archives.  A spokesperson for Verkada told the BBC: ""We have disabled all internal administrator accounts to prevent any unauthorised access. ""Our internal security team and external security firm are investigating the scale and scope of this issue, and we have notified law enforcement."" The company has also set up a support line for their customers.  Meanwhile Cloudflare told the BBC: ""This afternoon we were alerted that the Verkada security camera system that monitors main entry points and main thoroughfares in a handful of Cloudflare offices may have been compromised.  ""The cameras were located in a handful of offices that have been officially closed for several months."" Tesla has yet to comment.  The breach comes after  further details of a hack on Microsoft Exchange  are beginning to emerge. The attack used previously unknown flaws in the email software - and sometimes stolen passwords - to steal data from targets' networks.

Here is what you should do if you are attacked by an angry swarm. ""Initially I thought I had brushed my arm against a stinging nettle but suddenly wasps were all around my upper torso and face. ""I dropped the machine and was desperately flailing my arms around trying to get them off my face. ""Even though I made a run for it they just followed and kept stinging me, they were really aggressive.""  The wasps attacked the 70-year-old, from Delamere in Cheshire, while he was trimming a hedge. They usually only sting when they feel threatened, said Natalie Bungay, technical officer at the  British Pest Control Association (BPCA). image copyright Getty Images image caption Wasps can sting multiple times ""The problem is a wasp in distress emits a pheromone that sends nearby colony members into a defensive, stinging frenzy,"" said Ms Bungay. ""That's right - scare a wasp and it might call for backup."" Although it may be easier said than done,  NHS advice  is not to wave your arms around or swat at wasps but remain calm and move away slowly.  And in case you had any other creative ideas to give them the slip, wasps will not be fooled by anyone who tries to ""play dead""  said Debugged , the blog by pest control giant Rentokil.

He could not get an on-the-day appointment with his GP so went to A&E. image copyright Getty Images image caption One nest may produce 3,000-8,000 wasps in a year If you are stung you should pull out any stings left in the skin and wash the area with soap and water, according to NHS advice.

By Rebecca Seales BBC News Published 14 November 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Dan Kitwood/Getty Images image caption A Great White Shark pictured in Gansbaai, South Africa Apparently if you're attacked by a shark, it helps to have read the news. Fortunately for surfer Charlie Fry,  when a 2m (6.5ft) long shark launched at him on a beach near Sydney, he remembered a famous survival story . The source - Australian pro surfer Mick Fanning, who punched a shark in the back live on TV during a competition in South Africa. Both men were lucky enough to escape with their lives. But is punching the predator really the best way out of that situation?  We got some expert advice on how to survive a shark attack...  Worst-case scenario: If the shark decides you're prey Ryan Johnson is a shark researcher and documentary maker who studies great whites. He told the BBC it depends if the animal is checking you out, or has gone in for the kill.  ""From my experience free-diving with white sharks - if you're in that situation where you are getting attacked, you have to do everything in your power,"" he said. ""Punching him in the face, going for his eyes, try to keep your hands out of his mouth.  ""If you start touching them around the snout, they can pick up your electro-receptions and they know you're possibly edible."" He advises using ""something hard - be it a camera, a stick, a rock"" - to push the animal away.  ""In a situation where you don't have that, going for the face and the gills and trying to keep your hands out of its mouth is always the best thing."" media caption Surfer Mick Fanning: ""I punched the shark in the back"" What if it hasn't attacked yet? If there's a shark nearby, surely the best thing is to get away as fast as possible? Actually, no...  ""The worst thing is to try to run away,"" Mr Johnson advises. ""It's like throwing a stick for a dog. Fleeing often can entice a shark... Standing your ground and trying to make yourself big and going vertical in the water is always the best response to make a shark keep its distance from you."" Should you carry knives, or sticks? Conservationist and wildlife author Richard Peirce, who lives between Africa and the UK, has had many sharks approach ""closer than I was happy with"", and agrees the best deterrent is a shove to the nose from a heavy object - perhaps a camera, or a shark ""billy"" - basically a sharpened stick about two or three feet long. Surfer Mick Fanning in another shark scare Australia brings in drones to protect swimmers Woman picks up shark in Australia rescue What about a knife? ""Gosh, no! Hopeless, hopeless,"" he says. ""All you're going to do is excite the animal. You've got a little knife four, six, eight inches long, and you've got a two or three or four metre white shark or a three or four metre tiger shark... There's no chance whatsoever of fighting the shark. And if you do start it bleeding, you could well attract other animals in...""  Doesn't really bear thinking about... But there's safety in numbers, right? Absolutely. If you're diving in shark-inhabited waters, make sure you're in a pair. That way if a shark shows up, you can keep the animal in sight.  ""The shark is an apex predator,"" Mr Peirce notes. ""It's an ambush predator. If they know that you're watching, they will circle you - and that's happened to me loads of times - but what you do, basically, is try to slowly swim back together.""  So once again, despite every instinct - don't panic, don't splash.   image copyright Science Photo Library image caption Tiger sharks are curious animals, and can be found in warm, shallow waters ""A great white doesn't want a mouthful of wetsuit and sinew - we're not on the menu, it's just curiosity. Sharks exhibit body language, just like a dog. You know when that dog's starting to growl, bare its teeth - and it's exactly the same with a shark. When that happens, you've got to be calm.""   And the worst time and place to swim? ""Don't swim at dawn or dusk,"" Mr Peirce advises. ""Those are the times that sharks can make mistakes. And those are also prime hunting times.  ""And you wouldn't swim in an estuary situation. Bull sharks live in fresh water and sea water. You wouldn't swim anywhere near a fishing boat, because they could be discarding guts and bits of old fish - all of which will bring in sharks and put them in feeding mode.""  media caption A British man has told 5 live Breakfast how he swam over four miles to safety after being ""followed"" by a tiger shark So how risky is it, really? There are over 400 species of shark, and around a dozen are considered highly dangerous to humans - chiefly the great white, tiger shark and bull shark. The chances of dying in a shark attack are definitely extremely slim.  The Florida Museum of Natural History puts the odds of a fatal attack at about 1 in 3,748,067 .  But of course, the risk depends on your habits -  surfers are obviously more likely to run into a fin than those who rarely set foot in the sea, as Surfer.com estimated .    It also depends where you are. The coasts of South Africa, Brazil, Hawaii, and Fiji are all shark territory, while in the US Florida and California are most affected. There have been 18 shark attacks - including one fatal incident - in Australia this year, according to the  Australian Shark Attack File ,  But overall, sharks are at much greater risk from humans than we are from them.  Some estimates suggest an astonishing 100 million die due to human activity every year  - or around 11,000 an hour.

By Joel Gunter BBC News Published 18 April 2018 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Syrian civil war image copyright Reuters image caption Experts confirmed that the nerve agent Sarin was used in an attack in the Ghouta in 2013 A week after they gathered in Syria, inspectors from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons are finally gaining access to the site of an alleged chemical attack in the town of Douma. Rescue workers and opposition activists say government aircraft dropped barrel bombs filled with toxic chemicals on Douma on 7 April, killing more than 40 people and injuring hundreds more.  Medics reported seeing patients with symptoms including foaming at the mouth, blue skin and lips, corneal burns and convulsions, which they said indicated exposure to chlorine and possibly a nerve agent.  The government and its ally, Russia, said the incident was staged, but requested that an OPCW Fact-Finding Mission investigate the allegations. media caption Unverified video shows children being treated after alleged gas attack For the inspectors, getting into Douma is the first hurdle. When they arrive they will face many more. How do you gather evidence of a chemical weapon attack, almost a fortnight after it happened, in an environment controlled by forces accused of perpetrating the alleged attack? The inspectors will be looking for three types of evidence: environmental, biomedical and documentary, said Hamish de Bretton Gordon, a British chemical weapons expert who has investigated previous attacks in Syria. Environmental evidence could include debris from munitions, as well as soil samples and chips of concrete from buildings. Biomedical evidence includes blood, hair and urine from victims. Documentary evidence - witness testimony, footage, and social media posts. What we know about the 'chemical attack' Why is there a war in Syria? ""If they find any weapon debris they will be swabbing it for samples,"" Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. ""They will be interviewing as many people as they can, and attempting to verify the veracity of those witnesses. And they will be trying to find the injured and the dead."" That was key, he said - the injured and the dead. Biomedical samples provide the most reliable evidence of the use of chemical agents.  ""Urine can be good for identifying the presence of chlorine,"" he said. ""And blood samples will show the presence of a nerve agent, as will hair."" image copyright CBS image caption CBS News found a yellow gas canister on the roof of a building allegedly targeted in Douma The nerve agent Sarin was used in an attack that killed hundreds of people in the Ghouta region outside Damascus in August 2013. In that case, OPCW experts gained access to the affected areas after two days as part of a UN mission. They collected a significant amount of biomedical evidence from survivors, as well as environmental samples.  Angela Kane, a former UN high representative for disarmament affairs, led the mission. ""What we found in Ghouta was a very complex composite of Sarin,"" Ms Kane said. ""In its very pure form, Sarin evaporates very quickly, making it hard to detect. But in 2013 the Sarin was cut with other chemicals which meant that it stayed a lot longer on the ground."" Finding proof of the allegations made by the residents of Douma may be more difficult. On Tuesday, the US state department warned that the delays in getting the OPCW inspectors into the town would ""further degrade"" any evidence on the ground.  Russian military personnel are believed to have visited the attack site last week as rebel fighters were being evacuated. The US ambassador to the OPCW said he feared they might have ""tampered with it with the intent of thwarting the efforts of the OPCW Fact-Finding Mission"". Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov denied any interference. media caption Seth Doane, CBS, visits the scene of the 'chemical attack' in Douma In theory, if you wanted to clean up a chemical attack site, the first thing to do would be to locate and remove any debris from the munitions, Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. Then you would scrub down and clean anything contaminated by the chemical agents. Counter-intuitively, a chlorine-based solution is often used. You might also attempt to silence or remove witnesses from the location.  A Guardian newspaper report  on Wednesday suggested that medics in Douma had been threatened and had their WhatsApp conversations inspected. Another source of evidence is the dead. Under the Chemical Weapons Convention, OPCW inspectors should have access to any piece of evidence they want, including corpses. But first the bodies have to be found. ""If the inspectors find no bodies, that tells you something,"" Mr de Bretton-Gordon said. ""If those bodies have disappeared, that would be a very strong indication that something was very wrong."" In Douma, investigators will need to perform all of this work in an environment controlled by Syrian government and Russian forces. Filming everything as the work was carried out was key, said Ms Kane, as well as tightly securing any evidence. ""Those samples have to remain in your custody at all times,"" she said. ""You never let them leave your sight, wherever you are, onto the plane, all the way to the the laboratory.""

By Finlo Rohrer BBC News, Washington Published 6 October 2010 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption The Demon Sheep ad rapidly gained notoriety It's less than a month until the US mid-term elections and that means adverts that knock the opposition are coming thick and fast. But do the ""attack ads"" work and what makes a good one? Attack ads are not a uniquely American institution but many of the most powerful examples have come from the US.  Lyndon Johnson's  campaign advert Daisy , despite only being shown once, played a part in his landslide victory over Barry Goldwater in 1964.  Its ominous invocation of the dangers of nuclear war generated controversy. But nearly five decades on many political scientists believe that negative advertising works. It can complement positive advertising at different stages of a campaign. ""Early in the campaign you will see a lot of positive advertising as a candidate introduces himself,"" says Prof Stephen Ansolabehere, of Harvard University, and co-author of Going Negative: How Political Advertising Alienates and Polarizes the American Electorate. ""What's then left is to try and discredit the other guy. Later in the campaign you see them trying to call attention to the failings.  ""It could be issues, it could be scandals."" The Daisy ad from 1964 didn't even mention Johnson's opponent. It was left to the viewer to infer that the meaning was that Goldwater's policies could lead to cataclysm. media caption Republican California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina's most notable attack on incumbent Democrat Barbara Boxer was a seven minute web movie The crop of 2010 are usually quicker to name the target.  Those attack ads that are intended for television are often only 30 seconds long.  They can target the private life or moral rectitude of the opponent. Louisiana congressman Charlie Melancon decided to take this tack in  an advert against incumbent Senator David Vitter .  In July 2007, Mr Vitter's phone number cropped up in phone records linked to a Washington DC brothel. Mr Vitter apologised for a ""very serious sin"" but would give no further details. Mr Melancon's advert - in the style of a true-crime TV show - returns to these and subsequent allegations. But this can be a dangerous type of attack, even in today's brutal political arena. ""I can imagine there are consultants who say 'your opponent is an adulterer or your opponent is a witch we have to hammer that home',"" says Prof Michael Franz, of Bowdoin College, co-author of Campaign Advertising and American Democracy.  ""That is where the political scientists would say that is dangerous waters. Voters sometimes don't like that style of attack and they could punish the sponsor of it.""  And attacks on the views of the opponent also have the possibility to backfire. One of the most controversial ads of the run-up to the mid-terms so far is Florida Democrat congressman  Alan Grayson's attack on his Republican opponent Dan Webster . media caption Alan Grayson suggests in this video his opponent Dan Webster's religious views could be compared to the Taliban A string of headlines about Mr Webster's stance on women, and audio clips of him talking, culminates in the legend ""Taliban Dan Webster"" written in vaguely Arabic looking script.  It drew fire with critics saying it had taken Mr Webster's comments out of context and edited them misleadingly. A  poll highlighted in the New York Times  suggests Mr Grayson lost much support in just one week after the release of the ad.  This year's US primaries saw some fruity adverts, with the  Demon Sheep ad  already notorious in the field of attack ads. Carly Fiorina attacked her Republican rival's fiscal credentials. But who would have thought that such mainstream subject matter could result in an internet video featuring a man dressed as a sheep sporting demon eyes? It generated criticism but also much buzz.  Having dealt with her Republican rival, Ms Fiorina must now deal with incumbent Democrat Senator Barbara Boxer.  Her strategy involves both short ads like  her criticism of Ms Boxer  for insisting on being addressed as ""senator"" and longer internet ads like the extraordinary Hot Air: The Movie, which depicts Ms Boxer as a giant hot air balloon of egotism.   Ms Boxer's own  most recent attack ad  focuses on Ms Fiorina's record as an executive with Hewlett-Packard, outsourcing jobs to China.  It's a battle royale in much the same way as the fight between billionaire Meg Whitman and veteran Jerry Brown for the office of governor. Ms Whitman has  used the words of Democrat President Bill Clinton  to damn Mr Brown.  And Mr Brown  has been able to respond with  an attack on Ms Whitman's record as an Ebay executive .  Third party adverts can be even more vicious.  ""In this election, there will be more third party advertising. Third party adverts tend to be more negative,"" says Prof Ansolabehere.  This  advert from the National Republican Senate Committee  is an example, attacking Illinois Democrat Senate candidate Alexi Giannoulias for having links to organised crime through his brother.  The best are short and pithy, says Prof Ansolabehere, with Connecticut  Republican Senate candidate Linda McMahon's attack on her Democrat opponent  being a good example.  ""That is a pretty good character attack, straightforward, grainy black and white images.  ""A 30 second advert is four or five sentences. It is a little tiny narrative about the candidate.""  Democrat rival Richard Blumenthal's own ads again  take advantage of his opponent's business background .  image caption The Daisy advert is still inspiring imitators nearly five decades later While there are many who believe negative ads can work, particularly to focus attention on a particular policy issue, it's not easy to quantify precisely how well they work.  This applies even for those adverts widely perceived to have been successful. One such example was the  Willie Horton ad  from 1988, in which it was suggested that Democrat presidential candidate Michael Dukakis had supported a policy which allowed a ""weekend pass "" for a murderer who went on to commit a rape.  ""There is a debate among historians about the Willie Horton ad,"" says Prof Franz. ""Some people say that was a successful attack adâ¦ but it may have worked against [President George HW] Bush."" And while efforts are made to research what topics will hurt the opponent, it's not an exact science.  ""There is some testing of these messages through focus groups. I don't think there is prevailing wisdom about the attacks that work,"" says Prof Franz  Fred Davis, chief executive of the Republican-oriented media firm, Strategic Perception, oversaw both the Hot Air and Demon Sheep web films and believes a successful attack ad is now simply one that gets people talking.  ""It doesn't just run and go in one ear and out the other - it jolts them and makes them think. You want everybody the next day talking about your ad."" The rise of YouTube means a successful media strategy is now a mix of 30-second television adverts and longer clips aimed at viral web success.  But the spirit of the attack remains the same. "

He was found, soaking wet,  by officers outside the home of a woman who had called police. On Thursday, extracts of his interviews with police after his arrest were read out in court. He told officers his intention was to ""go out and kill or be killed"" adding that he looked for ""small groups who I thought I could overpower"". ""I had planned to kill people,"" he said. image copyright Family handout image caption Richard Hall suffered 26 injuries in the attack, the court heard ""It was sort of a gradual, long process for me. It was planned, it was calculated to a large extent. I think that's a very important point."" He had considered attacking an elderly couple and when asked by an officer why he did not carry it out, Mr Christensen, of Corser Street, Stourbridge, West Midlands, said he ""didn't feel comfortable"". ""I could see people on the hillside in the distance so I planned for further targets. That is what I was doing,"" he said. But the attack on Mr Hall, from Perton in South Staffordshire, happened when foggy conditions provided a ""good opportunity"", with many of Mr Christensen's ""criteria"" in place, jurors heard. Dr Brett Lockyer, a Home Office-approved pathologist, told the court Mr Hall suffered wounds to his neck and chest, as well as one penetrating his skull. He would have died in ""seconds to minutes"" due to the severity of his injuries, Dr Lockyer said. Jurors must decide if the killing was murder or manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility. The trial continues. Follow BBC West Midlands on  Facebook ,  Twitter  and  Instagram .

By Camila Ruz BBC News Magazine Published 19 November 2015 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics November 2015 Paris attacks image copyright Rex Features Attacks of the magnitude of those that took place in Paris, killing 130 people and injuring more than 400, are extremely rare. The authorities do prepare for these emergencies but what advice is there for ordinary people?  Be prepared Many survivors of the Paris attacks have said that they  mistook the first gunshots for fireworks . This is typical, says John Leach, survival psychologist and military survival instructor.   People who are not expecting gunshots will assume that they are something else because it does not fit in with their expectations.  ""We respond to the model in our head and we don't respond directly to the environment and that is what makes us vulnerable,"" he says.  image copyright AFP/Getty Images image caption Fans at the Eagles of Death Metal gig did not expect to hear gunfire The time it can take to understand what is happening can be lethal. But if someone has already thought through a few worst-case scenarios then this process will be quicker. ""All you need to ask is - if anything goes wrong, what is my first response going to be?"" explains Leach.  It's easy to sit in a restaurant or cinema without paying any attention to the emergency exits. But knowing where they are can save lives.  In the attack on the Bataclan concert hall on Friday,   a security guard led a group of people to safety  through the fire exit on the left of the stage.  React quickly image copyright Getty Images The vast majority of people will be too confused to do anything during an attack.  Leach has looked at life-threatening situations around the world and has found that only 15% of people will respond in a way that helps them survive. Up to 75% will just be too bewildered by what is happening around them to react at all.  The other 10% will react in ways that reduce their chances of survival and get in the way of other people, he says.  Acting decisively might make survival more likely. But it's also human nature to wait for other people to act first. In  a classic experiment , psychologists put people in a room and filled it with smoke to see how they would react. People who were on their own were more likely to take action than those who were with other people.  Make yourself a smaller target ""Where there's cover from sight, there's cover from fire,"" advises Ian Reed, a former British soldier, military instructor and chief executive of the Formative Group security firm. The first thing is to try to get out of the way and make yourself a smaller target. This can involve simply dropping to the ground but ideally means getting behind some sort of cover.  Hard cover such as a concrete wall is the best option. ""Obviously, Hollywood has portrayed cars as being bulletproof but that's not necessarily the case,"" says Reed. Despite this, even a car is better than nothing at all.  When an attack happens in a tightly packed space, a single bullet can end up injuring several people. Keeping out of sight reduces the risk that you can be targeted deliberately and also the chances of being hit by someone simply spraying the room with fire.  media caption Philonenko Gregoire says his prosthetic leg ""fooled"" the gunman who was checking people on the ground for movement Many survivors in Paris  did this instinctively  - turning tables over to use as makeshift shelters or hiding behind speakers in the concert hall. But the lack of cover on the main floor of the Bataclan meant not everyone there was able to hide.  An Irish couple survived by playing dead. Another survivor, Theresa Cede, told the BBC: ""One guy was badly hurt, and moaning, so we tried to say: 'Shh, be quiet, stay alive and don't move,' because every time there was movement somewhere, there were more gunshots."" ""They are looking for movement - it will catch their eye,"" explains Reed. This is especially true if it's dark.  Some people in the Bataclan  did run for the exit when the attackers paused to reload. This can be risky, but in some scenarios running away is a good idea.  The UK government's advice, in its  document on ""dynamic lockdowns"" , is to run if there is a safe route out. But if there is no safe way to do this it advises hiding. The advice is summarised as ""run, hide, tell"". According to eyewitnesses on Friday, several people chose to stay hidden in offices and toilets until help arrived.  media caption Lassana Bathily: ""I switched off the fridge... and told customers to stay calm"" In January, 24-year-old  Lassana Bathily was hailed a hero  after hiding Jewish shoppers in a basement cold store during an attack by an Islamist gunman. He switched off the fridge and the lights and ran to get help. All of those he hid survived.  Fighting back Rushing a gunman has worked in some situations. In August,  a train attack was foiled  in France after passengers overpowered the lone gunman. But of the four passengers involved in subduing him, one was in the Air Force and another in the National Guard. The men only made the attempt after the shooter's weapon jammed.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Three American men confronted a gunman on a train in France Reed says that it's not a good idea to take on an assailant without training. ""It's just risking your life,"" he adds. It's important to remember that many attackers will be working in teams. Some will be wearing body armour and others could be carrying explosives.  Adel Termos is thought to have saved  dozens of lives in Beirut last week after he tackled a bomber from behind. But the suicide vest exploded and both Termos and the bomber died in the blast.  Despite the dangers, some people argue that it's important to be ready to fight if necessary. Members of the Islamic State group are not motivated by taking hostages, says James Alvarez, psychologist and hostage negotiator. ""There's nobody to negotiate with. Your value lies in you being dead. If I know that I'm going to be shot, I'd like to think that I'm not going to go down quietly."" image copyright Le Monde image caption One man helped a pregnant woman who hung from a window After the escape Once someone has managed to escape the situation it's important for them to remain vigilant. ""Get as far away as possible, behind as much hard cover as possible and go to the nearest authority figures for help,"" says Reed. It can be dangerous to join big groups nearby and to take public transport. ""Always assume that there's going to be a secondary device or action,"" adds Reed. The key is to take advice from police officers or other officials, as they may have better knowledge of the situation.  Help each other image copyright Getty Images The chances of being caught up in a major attack  are still low . But if it does happen, co-operating with others can increase people's chance of survival, says Chris Cocking, social psychologist and expert in crowd behaviour.   After the 7/7 London attacks, Cocking helped interview dozens of people involved and concluded that the quickest and most efficient way for a group to evacuate is for people to work together. This is the only way to avoid situations such as a crowd getting jammed at a fire escape. Cocking says that  most people are likely to try to help each other  even in extreme situations. ""There's an assumption that it's everybody for themselves but that just doesn't happen,"" he says.  Subscribe to the  BBC News Magazine's email newsletter  to get articles sent to your inbox.

DoS+attack|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-39639387|"How do you stop sharks attacking? Published 19 April 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing media caption Surfer Mick Fanning: ""I punched the shark in the back"" How do you stop a great white shark, a creature that can grow up to six metres in length and weigh more than a tonne? It is a question that has dogged authorities in those countries where people suffer attacks by sharks (great white and others). Attacks continue to happen, and as long as they do, so will the calls for preventative measures. In the latest case, Laeticia Brouwer, 17, was  fatally attacked  by a shark on Monday while surfing off Western Australia. In response, Australia's Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg has said he would consider new proposals, including culling, adding that the government ""would welcome any proposal to put human life first"". On Thursday, the Senate environmental committee will hold a hearing - already planned before Laeticia Brouwer's death - on shark mitigation strategies. But what are the possible solutions? Do they make sense? And are shark attacks a big enough problem to warrant such measures? image copyright Shark Shield The possible solutions 1) Shark shields A shark shield is a device that lets out an electromagnetic pulse to deter sharks, and the Western Australia (WA) government has proposed offering a subsidy of A$200 (Â£117; $150) to anyone wanting to buy one (this is roughly equivalent to a third of the cost of the device). On the other hand, the WA opposition says shields would remain prohibitively expensive to most people, even with a discount. The University of Western Australia's Oceans Institute has been tasked with testing different shark deterrents by Australia's federal government.  Speaking to media on Wednesday, Prof Shaun Collin, the institute's director, said a shark shield proved to be an effective deterrent in 400 tests of an ""investigative"" shark attack - in which the shark approaches prey to assess what it is. However, he said the shields proved ineffective in ""ambush"" attacks, in which the shark swims at speed from deep on seeing a silhouette - possibly of a surfer. Can science stop sharks attacking humans? 2) Shark nets media caption The shark net debate A shark net is stretched through the water to try and separate swimmers and surfers from what may try and approach them. They are not new at all, having been used across Australia for decades. The New South Wales government ran a trial with a net from 2015-16 and, in one aspect, it proved successful - it caught 133 sharks in that time. The down side? A government report showed 615 other marine animals were caught, including 90 threatened or protected species. Close to half of them died after being caught in the netting. The nets have been called cruel by campaigners, and have been cut by activists. Why the jump in NSW shark attacks? 3) Drum lines and culling image copyright Getty Images This method, too, has been attacked as cruel - it is a baited hook suspended underwater and tied to a float on the surface of the water. It is also anchored to the sea bed, meaning the shark has nowhere to go once it has taken the bait. Larger sharks are often shot; smaller ones released. It was a policy pushed in Western Australia under the state's previous government and has been used in other Australian states. There was some controversy that drum lines were not put in place on the beach where Laeticia Brouwer died. But many also question their effectiveness - including the government now in place in WA. On Tuesday, the state's Fisheries Minister Dave Kelly  told ABC : ""We made it clear in opposition that we don't see the merit in automatically deploying drum lines, because they don't actually make our beaches any safer. ""We want to focus on individual shark deterrence, which can actually provide genuine protection for the people who are most at risk."" The possibility of an active cull - not just killing sharks caught in drum lines - was one raised by Federal Environment Minister Josh Frydenberg on Wednesday. And while Australia's government is committed to  a programme  of conserving shark populations, and proposals of culls are generally met with protests, there is some support for a targeted cull. An editorial  in the centre-right The Australian newspaper  by its surf writer, written after Laeticia Brouwer's death, said ""our insane shark conservation policies have cost another life"", adding that there was blood on the hands of the government. Shark cull divides a nation There are plenty of solutions on the table - but just how big a problem are shark attacks in Australia? When Laeticia Brouwer was attacked near Esperance on Monday, she became the 15th person to be killed by a shark in Western Australia since 2000, but the first in the country since June last year. The number of shark attacks in Australia - including fatal and non-fatal - has risen over the past century, but in a way that is consistent with how Australia's population has grown.  But, as horrific as those incidents are for everyone affected, there is, on average, only one death due to a shark attack in Australia every year. The number of people killed by a shark in Australian waters has changed little over the years despite the country's population - and tourist numbers - booming. In 1950, when there were  8.3m  people living in Australia, two people were killed by sharks. Last year, with a population of more than  24m , there were still only two fatalities. John G West, who runs the Australian Shark Attack File, which reports all attacks for the Taronga Conservation Society, says the chances of being killed by a shark now are much slimmer than in previous years. In  a 2011 report , he said the number of attacks that were fatal fell from  45%  in the 1930s to  10%  in the decade leading up to 2011. But while human populations have grown, he points out that the number of sharks has fallen. One thing, though, seems sure. ""Encounters with sharks, although a rare event, will continue to occur if humans continue to enter the ocean professionally or for recreational pursuit,"" Mr West writes.

By Mike Wendling BBC Trending Published 25 March 2016 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright EPA image caption Medics try to help wounded people after the 19 March bombing in Istanbul. Following the attacks in Brussels, some social media users claimed recent attacks in Turkey and elsewhere had been downplayed compared to similar attacks in Europe and the West Do some terror attacks get more attention online and from the news media simply because they happen in the Western world? It's become depressingly familiar. Each time there is a terror attack, millions grieve and an online shock wave ripples out. Breaking news of a bombing or shooting is immediately met with a stream of hashtags online: the name of the city, drawings of its famous monuments, ""Pray forâ¦""  Almost immediately after that - often while people are still physically suffering in the streets or in hospital - come emotive political arguments - often about the Islamic faith, foreign policy, migration and even things like Nato and the European Union.  One specific allegation often levelled on social media is that terrorist attacks outside Western Europe and North America are routinely ignored both by social media users and traditional news outlets. After the November 2015 attacks in Paris, for instance, one of the most read articles on the BBC website  was about a seven-month-old attack in Kenya . Many people, it appears, were sharing the story to make a point. And a similar line of thought developed after Tuesday's attacks in Brussels. Online news outlets picked up on the chatter with headlines like "" Why Brussels mattered and Istanbul didn't "" and "" These Attacks Happened Days Before Brussels â But You Probably Didn't Hear About Them "". image copyright Twitter But is it really true? Are people on social networks - and the news media - really ""muted"" or even ""silent"" when bombs kill people in Turkey or Kenya? Let's consider social media first.  In the days following Tuesday's attacks, ""Pray for Brussels"" or ""Pray for Belgium"" was tweeted about 650,000 times. The equivalent figure for the  19 March Istanbul bombing , including ""Pray for Turkey"" and ""Pray for Ankara"", was about 400,000. (Those figures include mentions of the phrases in French and Turkish.) The English and French names for Brussels also spiked on Twitter and were used more than 6 million times after Tuesday. After the Istanbul bomb, ""Turkey"" and ""Istanbul"" were tweeted 2.2 million times. Keep in mind these are only rough approximations (for instance, many messages might include city and country names without referencing attacks). But we can draw some conclusions. The numbers aren't equal - but they also don't amount to ""silence"" over events in Turkey.  image copyright Twitter Aside from social media, however, there's the issue of news coverage. And that's where things appear to get interesting.   Because despite the levels of chatter on social media, English-language Google searches of news articles indicate that  coverage of the Brussels attacks far outstripped that of the bombs in Turkey . By BBC Trending's rough calculation, the term ""Istanbul attack"" was used fewer than 100,000 times in the past month in articles indexed by Google News, while the term ""Brussels attack"" returned nearly 14 million uses. Even comparing an atrocity with a roughly similar similar death toll -  the Ankara bombing on 13 March  - the phrase ""Ankara attack"" returns around 2 million web pages. Follow BBC Trending on Facebook Join the conversation on this and other stories  here . Searching news articles in this way is an imperfect science. But it seems to indicate that English-language news editors, presumably mostly sitting in Europe and North America, decided on the whole that the Brussels attacks were of greater interest to readers and viewers than the bombings in Turkey.  There is been no shortage of commentary about  how social media is transforming the world of news  - and much of it is true. Facebook and Twitter have reshaped the business and the way people watch and read news. Social networks have highlighted stories that might have gone unnoticed, have made journalists more responsive and have opened up new sources and avenues for investigation. But news organisations are still shaped by editors and the choices they make about which big stories to run with on a day-to-day basis. And those decisions, it seems, do not entirely align with what's popular on social networks.

Isaac Rocha, the brother of Medici's girlfriend, said the victim had been teaching him to boogie-board, or body surf, when the attack happened. ""He was screaming and then I saw, like, a shark tail,"" Mr Rocha told CBS News. ""And I swam to him as fast as I could in that moment.

Last week, several high-profile sites on the so-called ""hidden"", ""dark"" or ""deep"" web were seized. Experts are looking at techniques the authorities may have used to ""de-cloak"" people running services accessed through anonymisation service Tor. ""We were as surprised as most of you,"" said the group that develops Tor. In a blog post , the Tor Project team wrote: ""We are left asking, 'How did they locate the hidden services?' We don't know.  ""In liberal democracies, we should expect that when the time comes to prosecute some of the 17 people who have been arrested, the police would have to explain to the judge how the suspects came to be suspects. ""As a side benefit of the operation of justice, Tor could learn if there are security flaws in hidden services or other critical internet-facing services."" image copyright Other image caption Sites seized showed the following caption The anonymity Tor offers means that it has become popular with criminals as a way to conduct their activities online. But the Tor Project, which receives funding from the US government, is also seen as a key component for those who need anonymity on the internet for other important reasons, such as activism in repressive regimes. 'Operation Onymous' Tor is one of several services that allows people to access what is generally referred to as the ""hidden"", ""deep"" or ""dark"" web. Here, sites that do not show up on traditional search engines are located.  But more importantly, users on Tor have their locations, and therefore identities, hidden. This is achieved by routing a person's journey on the internet through various different computers in locations all over the world, creating anonymity. However, with this latest raid, the anonymity of users on Tor is again under question. But one expert, Dr Steven Murdoch, from University College London, told the BBC it was unlikely that Tor itself had been ""cracked"". ""Some major hidden markets are still available,"" he noted. ""Including some of the biggest.  image copyright Other image caption The apparent owner of the now-closed Doxbin posted the site's logs for other experts to pore over ""If they had a successful way of compromising hidden services they would have done it to everyone."" The shutdown of the hidden web services was co-ordinated by Europol in what it dubbed Operation Onymous.  In a press release, it said more than 400 services were shut - although it later clarified that to mean 400 pages were disabled. Those pages had belonged to 27 individual services that were seized and closed. The majority of the sites were selling drugs or other illegal paraphernalia, while others dealt with the selling of stolen credit card data. The most high-profile closure was of Silk Road 2.0 - a site selling drugs, set up after the closure of the original Silk Road site last year.  The Tor Project went into detail listing possible methods of how the sites were compromised and their owners arrested. They included: Poor operational security  - that is, basic failings in running the websites. On Silk Road 2.0, investigators noted that an email address identifying Blake Benthall, who's been accused of running the site, was found within its code Bugs in web applications -  just as in the open internet, elements used within pages, such as video players or other interactive features, on Tor can be vulnerable to bugs and exploits. The Tor Project said some of the sites seized were likely to have contained ""quickly-coded e-shops"" which as a result had weaknesses Bitcoin ""deanonymisation"" -  Those using illegal services need a way to pay for what they are getting - and Bitcoin is often the virtual currency of choice. While Bitcoin is far harder to trace than the use of normal payment methods, it is certainly not completely anonymous.  Recent research has demonstrated  ways to link Bitcoin transactions with a user's location Denial of Service (DoS) attack -  Highly theoretical at this stage, law enforcement could orchestrate a DoS attack - where a site is flooded with visits - in an attempt to force traffic to access Tor through computers owned and monitored by the authorities. Concerns about this complex technique  were raised earlier this year 'Hello, internet super-villain here' In an attempt to find clues as to the authorities' tactics, one owner of a seized site - who was apparently not arrested - released log files showing activity on his ""onion"", the term given to sites on Tor. He offered the logs up to the community for scrutiny. On a mailing list for Tor developers, he wrote: ""This will probably be a very humbling experience, because unlike my fellow illegal onion operators both past and present, I will actually be outside of a jail cell and able to read the ruthless dissection of my set-up.  media caption Troels Oerting from Europol explained to the BBC's Anna Holligan how the joint police operation unfolded ""On the bright side, you're all are getting way more info from me than the pigs [police] will ever willingly cough up, which means if they have some sort of magic onion de-cloak trick, this mailing list discussion is a good chance at finding it."" His post, titled, ""yes hello, internet super-villain here"", shared details of Doxbin, a hidden website that allowed people to upload documents supposedly anonymously. From the logs, some have suggested that the DoS attack, as detailed above, was responsible for ""de-anonymising"" users of the site. Dr Murdoch noted that getting a real explanation for how Operation Onymous was carried out is unlikely. ""They're not going to tell anyone about it because they want to do it again,"" he said. ""They want people to be afraid to run illegal hidden services."" Follow Dave Lee  on Twitter @DaveLeeBBC Explainer: What is Tor? Tor is a special way to access the internet that requires software, known as the Tor Browser bundle, to use it. The name is an acronym for The Onion Router - just as there are many layers to the vegetable, there are many layers of encryption on the network. It was originally designed by the US Naval Research Laboratory, and continues to receive funding from the US State Department. It attempts to hide a person's location and identity by sending data across the internet via a very circuitous route involving several ""nodes"" - which, in this context, means using volunteers' PCs and computer servers as connection points. Encryption applied at each hop along this route makes it very hard to connect a person to any particular activity. To the website that ultimately receives the request, it appears as if the data traffic comes from the last computer in the chain - known as an ""exit relay"" - rather than the person responsible. As well as allowing users to visit normal websites anonymously, it can also be used as part of a process to host hidden sites, which use the .onion suffix. Tor's users include the military, law enforcement officers and journalists - who use it as a way of communicating with whistle-blowers - as well as members of the public who wish to keep their browser activity secret. But it has also been associated with illegal activity, allowing people to visit sites offering illegal drugs for sale and access to child abuse images, which do not show up in normal search engine results and would not be available to those who did not know where to look.

The dense crowd eventually splintered, with some moving away to carry on drinking and listen to music.  The atmosphere among those who remained became more volatile.  Riot police in full protective gear formed a barricade in front of the station, but the officers didn't engage with the protesters at all.  They stood by as their shields and vans were daubed with graffiti - some of it profane and some of it hostile towards the police themselves and Home Secretary Priti Patel. Then the atmosphere took a marked turn when the first police vehicle was set on fire. Huge plumes of black smoke rose up from Bridewell Street.  A small number of protesters jumped on to the roof of a second police van, thumping on the glass as the officers tried to reverse.

DoS+attack|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37896273|"Tesco Bank attack: What do we know? Published 7 November 2016 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing media caption WATCH: Experts say the attack is unlike any they have seen before Supermarket giant Tesco has suspended some parts of its online banking system after it detected attempts to steal cash from customers' accounts.  It said it spotted ""suspicious transactions"" on 40,000 accounts over the weekend, with  money reportedly taken from about half of them. Tesco has declined to elaborate on what happened, or say how much cash went astray, but said it was working with the National Crime Agency to investigate and find the culprits. Is this the first of its kind? Yes, because this seems to be the first time that a UK bank has reacted so publicly by stopping some types of transactions on a web banking system because of ""online criminal activity"".  Banks are targeted all the time but typically those attacks just hit a few individuals, so do not bring about a site closure. In this case, as far as we can tell, a lot of people lost cash very quickly. Security expert Troy Hunt said the incident was unprecedented in its scale. He added that the shutdown was ""embarrassing"" for Tesco and indicated how serious it was. image copyright maciek905 image caption Updates to websites can introduce bugs and vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit Was it hacked? Tesco did not use the ""H"" word in its statement and in interviews its chief executive and other people speaking on behalf of the company have been careful in their choice of language. It has said that the attack was ""sophisticated"" and that an initial investigation had revealed exactly what had happened. So far, it has not shared that information but Tesco's actions in the wake of the weekend's events do help to narrow down the possibilities. By letting customers withdraw cash from ATMs, use cards in shops and pay bills, it suggests that whatever went wrong does not involve the core computer systems underpinning Tesco bank. These systems used to be run by RBS but since 2008 Tesco has operated independently. Security expert James Maude, from software company Avecto, said Tesco's decision to suspend online transactions combined with the information that so many people were hit at once clearly suggests problems with its website. All too often, he said, maintenance or website updates can introduce errors and bugs that were not present before. Cyber-thieves are constantly scanning valuable websites to spot changes and will swoop if one emerges. It might also be the case that a third party connected to Tesco had a security issue and attackers got in via that route, which has happened in some of the biggest attacks in recent memory. image copyright Thinkstock image caption To improve protection on bank accounts use a unique, hard to guess password Can it stop this happening again? Most cybersecurity experts have a very jaundiced view of the world that they often sum up by saying: ""Everything is broken and there is always a way in."" In short, there is no way that any organisation can keep it, and its customers and their data, safe all the time. Many organisations now assume they will be breached and set up monitoring systems to spot when that happens, while also training staff to react quickly to fix problems. Nik Whitfield, from security firm Panaseer, said often firms were caught out by vulnerabilities that emerge in software they use rather than through a change they make. It can be hard for organisations to keep across these factors because they use so many software packages.  In addition, some of the bugs are found by malicious hackers who sell them to gangs that want to use them. In these cases, the first an organisation will know about a bug is when it is used against them.  Tesco has had problems with some other web-based systems in the past. In 2014, thousands of Tesco customers' net accounts were deactivated after login names and passwords were shared online. In that case , Tesco said attackers had compiled the data by using details stolen from other sites, because some Tesco customers reused passwords. How did it notice the suspicious activity? Like many other banks, Tesco has automatic fraud-spotting systems that keep an eye on accounts and build up a picture of normal activity. It is these kind of systems that can catch you out if you suddenly use your credit or debit card to buy lots of things from lots of different places in just a few minutes.  It is these monitoring systems that are believed to have alerted Tesco to the problems that led to it suspending the site and halting transactions. image copyright Getty Images image caption Most bank sites offer two-factor authentication which is worth using to improve security Can I protect myself against these kinds of attacks? We still do not know the details of what happened so it is difficult to give concrete advice. However, it is worth taking a few simple steps to protect your online account.  First, choose a good password and do not reuse one that you use elsewhere. Use the bank's two-factor authentication and keep an eye on the transactions carried out via your account. Keep security software on your PC, phone or tablet up-to-date and be on the lookout for phishing emails that capitalise on news about any breach.  James Chappell, chief technology officer at computer security service Digital Shadows, said it was already starting to see cyber-gangs it monitors sending out spam posing as updates from Tesco security staff. The gangs are hoping to trick people into handing over their Tesco account details to let thieves take advantage.

Documents from the whistle-blower  published by NBC  indicate UK cyberspies used a denial of service attack (DoS) in 2011 to force a chatroom used by the Anonymous collective offline. A spokeswoman for GCHQ said all the agency's activities were authorised and subject to rigorous oversight. But others say it raises concerns. Dr Steven Murdoch, a security researcher at the University of Cambridge, said using a DoS attack to overwhelm a computer server with traffic would have risked disrupting other services. ""It's quite possible that the server was used for other purposes which would have been entirely unrelated to Anonymous,"" he said. ""It's also likely that most of the chat that was going on about Anonymous was not to do with hacking because the people who join Anonymous are fairly wide-ranging in what they think it is legitimate to do. ""Some have gone into criminality but many others just go out and organise protests, letter-writing campaigns and other things that are not criminal."" Campaign group Privacy International is also worried. ""There is no legislation that clearly authorises GCHQ to conduct cyber-attacks,"" said head of research Eric King. ""So, in the absence of any democratic mechanisms, it appears GCHQ has granted itself the power to carry out the very same offensive attacks politicians have criticised other states for conducting."" The UK government's Cyber Security Strategy document,  published in 2011 , says officials should take ""proactive measures to disrupt threats to our information security"", but also notes that any such action should be consistent with freedom of expression and privacy rights. Hacker arrests The latest documents are published  alongside an article  part-written by Glenn Greenwald.  The journalist is one of only two people reported to have access to all whistle-blower Edward Snowden's leaked documents. image copyright Getty Images image caption GCHQ has not discussed the specifics of the operations included in the Snowden leaks The article highlights that the Joint Threat Research Intelligence Group (JTRIG) is the division identified as being responsible for the DoS attack  - a unit whose existence had not previously been publicly disclosed. The documents indicate the unit also spied on and communicated with chatroom users to identify hackers who had stolen information. In one case, agents are said to have tricked a hacker nicknamed P0ke who claimed to have stolen data from the US government. They did this by sending him a link to a BBC article entitled: ""Who loves the hacktivists?"" ""Sexy,"" P0ke is alleged to have commented.  But when he clicked the link it is reported that JTRIG was able to bypass measures he had taken to hide his identity, although it is not clear how. image caption GCHQ is said to have tricked one hacktivist by sending him a link to a BBC article NBC reports that P0ke - a Scandinavian college student - was never arrested despite GCHQ learning his true name. But the leaks indicate others were imprisoned as a result of JTRIG operations.  One paper highlights the case of Edward Pearson - a hacker known as GZero - who was sentenced to two years in jail in 2012 for illegally acquiring credit and debit card details registered with PayPal. A transcript of a chatroom conversation indicates that Pearson had contacted GCHQ agents claiming he knew a hacktivist they were investigating, unaware of the agents' true identity. 'Grey area' In addition to Anonymous, the documents list LulzSec, the A-Team and the Syrian Cyber Army as hacktivist groups GCHQ was concerned about. In one case it appears simply warning activists that carrying out their own DoS attacks was illegal had the desired effect. NBC reports that the notice was posted via Facebook, Twitter, email, instant messenger and Skype.  One alleged GCHQ document states that one month later 80% of those contacted had stopped using a hacktivist chatroom. image copyright Lulzsec image caption Several of the Lulzsec hackers have been arrested after carrying out DoS attacks But the documents also indicate that GCHQ was willing to use DoS attacks itself as part of an operation codenamed Rolling Thunder, which prevented hacktivists using a chatroom for 30 hours in September 2011. GCHQ has a longstanding policy of not commenting on specific intelligence-gathering procedures, but a spokeswoman said all its work was ""carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework"". Even so, one cybersecurity expert said he had mixed feelings about the latest leaks. ""We have to remember that cyberspooks within GCHQ are equally, if not more, skilled than many black-hat hackers, and the tools and techniques they are going to use to fight cybercrime are surely going to be similar to that of the bad guys,"" said Andrew Miller, chief operating officer at Corero Network. ""Legally, we enter a very grey area here; where members of Lulzsec were arrested and incarcerated for carrying out DoS attacks, but it seems that JTRIG are taking the same approach with impunity.""

Health Minister Vaughan Gething is expected to announce whether  the new Â£180m Velindre Cancer Centre  in Whitchurch will be backed this week. But the clinicians are concerned about the possible number of patient transfers from the centre to a larger hospital and the time that takes. Health bosses said ""safety and care is at the heart of everything we do"". Velindre NHS Trust has previously said only 30 patients were transferred a year between its current cancer centre and Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. About 10 were designated as red, the most serious, by the ambulance service. But, following a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, clinicians found the transfers were closer to 100 in recent years.  The plans for the new hospital  have led to protests and a petition signed by more than 7,500 people , opposed to it being built on the Northern Meadows site in Whitchurch. The dispute over ambulance transfers has raised further concerns about the planned hospital. image caption Protesters said they are not against the new hospital but do not want it built on green open land The clinicians have said they are also concerned Velindre might have played down the seriousness of amber calls.  There have been more than 70 red or amber calls each year in recent years, according to the FOI request. The two clinicians - who asked to remain anonymous - discovered that average transfer times for amber calls in 2019 was just under an hour, with another 45 minutes to be transferred to the ward after arriving at Cardiff's University Hospital of Wales. One of the clinicians said: ""The amber category are very unwell patients who need to have urgent care.  ""It's not the eight-minute response for heart attack but they do need help and that help can't be provided at Velindre."" They said amber calls can include patients having breathing difficulties, stroke, or major haemorrhage. ""So the amber category are very unwell patients who need to have urgent care,"" added the medic. ""The idea that these are routine calls using the 999 system is disingenuous... they're definitely downplaying the figures."" The clinicians warned that developments in immunotherapy meant there was a greater risk of patients suffering side effects and claim the new Velindre should be on the site of a larger hospital such as the University Hospital of Wales.  image copyright Velindre Cancer Centre  image caption Artist's impression of the new Velindre Cancer Centre in Whitchurch They added the Northern Meadows proposal was outdated and the trust should look to build a centre similar to  the new Clatterbridge cancer hospital at Wirral . ""I'm not just expressing a personal opinion - I'm speaking for 30 clinicians at Velindre, 57 doctors who signed a letter last year and the 163 senior clinicians who recently signed a letter to the health secretary,"" said one of the clinicians.  ""All of whom have expressed concerns that building an isolated unit here on the Northern Meadows, without intensive care, high dependency and all the other backup you need for sick patients, is extremely risky."" Both clinicians said they have chosen to remain anonymous due to fear of online trolling and harassment. In literature provided to the Senedd ahead of the petitions committee last week, Velindre said that, over the past five years, no serious incidents had been reported to Welsh Government due to preventable deaths on-site relating to a delay in transfer to an acute hospital, or due to the lack of critical care or anaesthetic support onsite. Doctors' 'deep concern' over new cancer centre Protest over cancer hospital plan for city meadows It said: ""Velindre Cancer Centre treats some of Wales' most vulnerable patients - their safety and care is at the heart of everything we do and we work closely with our staff and colleagues in university health boards to provide the best cancer services possible for the people of south-east Wales. ""The need for a new Velindre Cancer Centre is clear.  ""The current building cannot sustain high quality patient care indefinitely given the age of the building and the increasing number of cancer diagnoses."" The trust said a recent review found co-locating the new cancer centre at the University Hospital of Wales would ""not be an option for some time"" and action was required now to improved regional cancer services. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""We have conducted detailed scrutiny of the outline business cases for the new Velindre Cancer Centre and its enabling works.  ""Welsh ministers are now considering the outcome of this formal process and a decision will be announced in due course.""

""To those who took part in this spree of offending, you can expect a knock at your door in the days or weeks to come - it may come sooner than you think,"" she added 'Thuggery and disorder' Prime Minister Boris Johnson said people had a right to protest but the violent scenes were ""unacceptable"". He added: ""They should protest peacefully and legally."" Speaking in the House of Commons earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel condemned the protests as ""anarchic"" and ""violent"". She said the minority of people who confronted police officers in the city centre on Sunday night had demonstrated ""criminal thuggery and disorder"" that put lives at risk. ""Our exceptional and brave police officers put themselves in harm's way to protect the public.  ""For them to face the criminal violence against them while upholding the law is completely unacceptable,"" she added. ""My thoughts are with the injured officers and their family."" Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees slammed offenders as ""selfish"" for ""living out their revolutionary fantasies"". Avon and Somerset Police Chief Constable Andy Marsh said the protest had been ""hijacked by extremists"", by ""people who were determined to commit criminal damage"". image caption Police vehicles were set on fire and fireworks were set off in the crowds Mr Marsh said: ""There was a hardcore of serious criminals hidden within those 3,000 people - perhaps 400 or 500 people - and we certainly didn't trigger this."" Crowds had gathered to peacefully protest in opposition to the new Police and Crime Bill but it went in a ""violent direction"" outside Bridewell Police Station at about 17:30 GMT, Mr Marsh said. As angry scenes unfolded, demonstrators scaled the station, threw fireworks into the crowd and daubed graffiti on the walls. In pictures: Violence at Kill the Bill Bristol protest What is the police and crime Bill? Mr Marsh said that while it would not have been ""practical or possible"" to arrest more people on the night, those involved in the violence can expect ""very serious consequences"". ""We will be asking for the people of Bristol to identify these thuggish citizens so we can bring them to justice,"" he added. image caption Graffiti has been removed from walls By 17:30 there were approximately 300 police officers at the scene.  Two officers were injured and treated in hospital, with one suffering a punctured lung and broken ribs, and the other a fractured arm. Both have since been discharged. Twelve police vehicles were also damaged, with two set on fire. It is understood the police operation cost around Â£1m. Andy Roebuck, chairman of Avon and Somerset Police Federation said: ""We had them actually squirting liquid on our visors.  ""They've turned up with weapons and then tried to set fire to a police vehicle with police officers actually inside it.  ""That is close to attempted murder of those police officers as far as we are concerned in the Police Federation.  ""That is the level of violence and determination that these animals have gone to. And this is something we can not tolerate."" Analysis: Tom Symonds, BBC Home Affairs Correspondent At times there were as few as 50 police officers, facing 100 or more violent protesters. Horses and dogs were used to great effect, but their numbers have been cut in the last decade.  This means that arguably, the police were outnumbered.  To arrest one protester during the pandemic, it currently takes an average of three officers and one vehicle, since suspects have to be kept socially distanced.   However, public order commanders know that sending in snatch squads to make arrests also leads to a more violent response.   So, instead of clearing the streets, and making arrests, a decision was taken for police to hold their ground, and gather evidence for later investigations.   The result has given a dangerous impression.  A feeling of a loss of control which was also a feature of the early stages of the 2011 riots in England.   Workers from Bristol Waste spent the morning removing broken glass, debris and offensive graffiti from the streets.  Bristol Mayor Marvin Rees said the violence had made people already dealing with inequality in the city less safe and questioned whether the perpetrators were from Bristol or were ""protest tourists"". He said: ""Smashing buildings in our city centre, vandalising vehicles, attacking our police will do nothing to lessen the likelihood of the bill going through.  ""On the contrary, the lawlessness on show will be used as evidence and promote the need for the bill. ""This is a shameful day in an incredible year for Bristol. These people should feel shame."" image copyright Colin Moody image caption Police riot shields and vans were sprayed with graffiti Sue Mountstevens, Avon and Somerset's police and crime commissioner, said the behaviour was ""completely unacceptable"". She said: ""It's disgraceful these men and women who started their days expecting a normal day of policing have all returned battered and bruised. ""These people have shown reckless disregard of the lives and safety of our communities in central Bristol and our officers. 'Cause chaos' ""Whether you agree or disagree with the bill, these men and women did not deserve to face the level of violence directed at them. Nothing can justify such actions."" University student Rhianna Prewitt, who attended the demonstration, said: ""This is a symptom of not allowing organisers to actually properly organise protests and, by doing that, extremists and people who are looking for a riot are going to take advantage to cause chaos. ""Also, if the government doesn't want us to protest during the pandemic, why are they pushing through a significant law at this time without public scrutiny?"" media caption Protesters clashed with police and threw fireworks into the crowd Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the disorder was ""inexcusable"" and those involved should be identified and ""prosecuted where appropriate.""  He condemned the ""lawlessness"" by people who were ""intent on violence,"" adding parallels could not be drawn between the protests in London against harassment and violence against women and the scenes in Bristol.

Mick Fanning was competing in a World Surf League competition when the shark came at him from behind. He punched the creature and escaped on a rescue craft. image copyright AP Unprovoked shark attacks on humans are rare with an average of around 75 per year, resulting in about 10 deaths.  You have a greater chance of dying from a bee sting or being hit by lightning. But with their amazing sense of smell, taste, hearing and sight, what can you do to avoid a shark attack? And what can you do if you are attacked? image caption A black-footed albatross tries to escape from the jaws of a Tiger shark Avoid being in the water from sunset to sunrise This is when sharks are most active. Also avoid swimming during or after storms, which can make the water cloudy and churn up the fish that sharks feed on. They won't be able to tell if you're human or prey. The same applies to river mouths -  where the water can be muddy. Stay in a group image copyright Getty Images image caption Bethany Hamilton was 13 when she was attacked by a tiger shark during a morning surf People on their own are more likely to be attacked than large groups.  Don't wander too far from the shoreline.  The further you are from the shore, the further you are from help. Consider your clothing Avoid wearing shiny jewellery, because the reflected light resembles the shimmer of fish scales. Also don't wear brightly-coloured or patterned clothing, because sharks see contrast particularly well. Special striped wetsuits which look like poisonous, black and white banded sea snakes are being tested which warn a shark that a diver or surfer isn't safe to eat. image copyright Getty Images Don't enter water being used by amateur or commercial fisherman Sharks can sense the smells emitted from bait at incredible distances, so steer clear of areas where fishermen are using rods and the routes which fishing boats use.  It's fairly obvious that you shouldn't feed sharks. Avoid contaminated or contaminating water Stay out of water with sewage being pumped into it and don't enter the water if you are bleeding. They both attract sharks. image copyright AP Look out for sharks' prey If other marine mammals such as seals are around, the chances are that sharks will be too.   Also be on the lookout for signs of bait fishes or feeding activity - diving seabirds are good indicators. Animals that eat the same food items are often found nearby.  Remember, a predator is never too far from its prey. Don't splash about Try not to splash around while in the water, and don't allow pets in the water because of their splashing movements. You don't want to make the same movements as a shark's favourite meal makes. Be careful where you swim It's probably not a great idea to swim between sandbars or near steep drop-offs in the ocean, because those are the favourite places for sharks to congregate. image copyright Science Photo Library Stay away from shark-infested waters Don't enter the water if sharks are known to be present, and get out of the sea if sharks are seen while there. And, of course, don't harass a shark if you see one. Stay still if you spot a shark If you do see a shark stay where you are as quietly as possible. Most sharks are just curious and will leave on their own. If you can, stay relaxed. Attacks are very rare.  If attacked, attack back If you are targeted by a shark, the general rule is, do whatever it takes to get away - but do it calmly. But try to fight back and startle it. The best place to hit is its nose. Also try to claw at its eyes and grab its gills, two of the most sensitive areas on a shark.  image copyright AFP/Getty Images Never take your eyes off the shark, because they have several methods of attack including hit-and-run and bump-and-bite. Make sure you're able to defend your front and sides and use a weapon like a surf board if possible, don't use your hands. If you are bitten, stop the bleeding and get help as soon as possible. The tips were put together by George H. Burgess, senior biologist in Ichthyology at the Florida Museum of Natural History.

Mark Mardell North America editor @BBCMarkMardell on Twitter Published 10 January 2012 comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Republicans have had some sharp words about Obama's economic policies - but do they add up? Waterville Valley, New Hampshire: Skiers in bright clothes snake down the mountain side in the brilliant sunshine  of the White Mountains .  But puffs of fine fog further up the slope are a tell-tale sign of an unseasonable annoyance. No snow.  The mist from half a dozen blowers is man-made snow. The skiing is fine, but the resort as a whole feels less wintry than it should. That is a worry to some in a state where tourism long ago replaced manufacturing as the main source of income.  No-one blames President Obama for the weather. The White House isn't accused of stopping snow with too many regulations. That is almost a surprise.  But the Republican candidates vying to become their party's candidate for president do blame him for most of the country's economic woes, and do so in strong language.  They suggest  he's killed jobs  and is taking the US on an un-American road. Front-runner Mitt Romney says in every speech that Obama is turning an enterprise culture into a European-style entitlement society.  Given that the latest figures  suggest the economy  is picking up, I wonder how this plays now. Particularly in New Hampshire, a state that is richer, has less poverty and lower unemployment  than most in the USA . The Waterville Valley ski resort's boss is Chris Sununu, the son of John,  former White House chief of staff and New Hampshire governor . Chris Sununu says both as a businessman and a Republican he does blame Obama for the state of the economy. ""When you have a strategy of big bloated government, a lot of regulation, and the sense that government can do better than the individual can, that's just not what America was built on, and that's not what drives a good free economy,"" he says. I put it to him that is fine as political rhetoric, but question whether Obama's policies have really hurt his thriving ski resort. ""Without a doubt,"" Sununu said. ""In the season, I have close to 500 to 800 employees at any given time. The healthcare costs alone can be enormous on that. But if I don't know what the regulations are gonna be, if I think government is going to be too overbearing on me, then I have to hold my cash. ""I have to hold back. I can't expand. I can't be creative. I can't give my employees the benefits that they might need because I don't know what's coming down the road. It's that uncertainty that so many businesses in America are facing today, that we just gotta get out from underneath."" Not everyone agrees that the language of the campaign reflects reality. At the house party for Republican candidate Jon Huntsman  which  I mentioned yesterday , I ran into Donald Byrne.  Mr Byrne is the boss of a software company and an independent who's re-registered as a Republican so he can vote for the former ambassador to China and Utah governor.  He says the language used about Obama is pandering to the base. ""I think the Republican party in the United States has shifted very far to the right,"" he says.  ""Being a moderate is a negative in this campaign and that's very unfortunate, because the majority of Americans are moderate and well balanced in their thought process. ""There is too much pandering to these right-wing extreme sides."" It is the nature of elections that choices are put in stark, easy-to-understand terms. I have no doubt that in 2012 two very different visions of America will be on offer.  But does a polarised politics force cruder choices than might be good for a country's economic health?  I meet Bob Bastani, a senior New Hampshire Republican and economist, in his home over-looking New Hampshire's beautiful coastal basin near Newmarket.   He worked in the treasury team under the first President Bush, most recently headed a bank in the Philippines and ran unsuccessfully for Congress.  He told me that while politics still was a battle between the  economics of Milton Friedman  and  John Maynard Keynes  , in reality, neither theory can cope with the current crisis. ""That battle between those two views has been the central debate in economics for almost 100 years now, but they have converged somewhere in the middle,"" Mr Bastani said.  ""If you look at Keynesian economics, they have moved much more towards an acceptance of monetary policy.  ""That's part of the problem: the two have sort of met in the middle, and are stuck there with no real policy prescriptions. So there is no real black-and-white answer much as we would like to have black-and-white answers. ""So if you have the two principal instruments of economic management no longer working, then what do you do? And that's the central conundrum."" Still, campaigning in primary colours works well, even if you have to govern in grey. Republican voters choosing a candidate on Tuesday may be looking for the man best able to excoriate Obama, rather than the one most suited to replace him. By the time the polls close, he may even have been blamed for the lack of snow.  View comments"

Sven Badzak was waiting outside a bagel shop in Kilburn, north-west London, with his 16-year-old friend when the pair were attacked last Saturday. A 19-year-old man and a 17-year-old boy arrested on suspicion of murdering the 22-year-old have been released on bail. The victims did not know their attackers and police do not believe they were robbed, the Met said.  Mr Badzak's mother, Jasna, said she believes her son was killed in a random attack. She said her son, who was privately educated at Wetherby and Portland Place schools before attending Roehampton University, had gone to a shop to get orange juice and then to a bagel shop when he was attacked. As he and his friend were chased at around 17:30 GMT, they became separated and Mr Badzak, from Maida Hill, west London, fell to the ground and was stabbed repeatedly. image copyright PA Media image caption Extra police officers were deployed after the stabbing in Kilburn The 16-year-old also suffered multiple stab injuries but managed to escape into a shop in Willesden Lane.

Published 4 June 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Reality Check image copyright Getty Images Following the London terror attack, which left seven people dead and 48 injured, Theresa May has said the UK must adapt to a ""new trend"" in terrorism. There were 255 terrorism-related arrests in the year ending 31 March 2016 , according to the latest statistics from the Home Office. The arrests led to 37 prosecutions. In 2015, 128 terrorist and extremist prisoners were released from custody, the Home Office says. Reality Check has been looking into the main powers the police and security services have to stop suspected terrorists. Stop and search Under Section 43 of the Terrorism Act 2000 the police can stop and search a suspect if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in terrorist activities. It's difficult to know how many stop and searches are carried out under this power as most police forces don't separate Section 43 from other types of stop and search.  One force that does hold the data is the Met police. They say that 541 people were searched under the Terrorism Act in the 12 months to March 2016 - a rise of 32% on the previous year.  The police also have the power to search suspects even if they don't have suspicion of any links to terrorist activities.  In May 2012 the rules were tightened: the police can only carry out searches in designated places where they have reasonable grounds to believe an act of terrorism will take place.  14 day detention At present anyone arrested under the Terrorism Act can be held without charge for up to 14 days. In 2006 the law was changed in order to double the maximum period to 28 days. Only six suspects were ever held for that length.  In 2011 it reverted back to 14 days . This was during the coalition government when it was decided not to proceed with the annual vote in Parliament to keep it at 28 days. Theresa May was home secretary at the time. In the year to March 2016, 46 people were detained under the powers - 25 of whom were charged. The longest anyone was held for was 13 days, which happened on three occasions during that year. Power to arrest suspects planning an attack The police can arrest individuals who they suspect of planning an attack. Section 5 of the 2006 Terrorism Act made it a specific offence to prepare (or help others prepare) for an act of terrorism. The maximum sentence for this offence is imprisonment for life. According to the CPS, 25 people were convicted under Section 5 in the year ending September 2016, up from 11 in the previous 12 months. There is no specific offence for carrying out a terrorist act. If a perpetrator was arrested after committing an attack they would be charged with offences such as murder or grievous bodily harm. It is also an offence for someone not to tell the police about someone they believe is involved in planning a terrorism act. A conviction for this offence can lead to a five year maximum sentence.  Banned organisations Organisations can be banned by the home secretary if they are believed to be participating, promoting or encouraging terrorism.  Being a member - or claiming to be a member - of a banned organisation can lead to a maximum of 10 years in prison and or a fine. The  Home Office says  71 international terrorist organisations are proscribed under the Terrorism Act 2000.  Surveillance A small number of agencies are able to carry out surveillance inside residential premises or private vehicles. The power requires authorisation by the secretary of state. The Office of Surveillance Commissioners provides independent oversight. The security services also have the power to intercept communication data. The power is available to nine agencies, including GCHQ and MI5.  The Investigatory Powers Act, passed in 2016, compels internet companies to keep records of every website and messaging service UK-based citizens visit for a year. TPims Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures, or TPims, are a form of house arrest. It applies to people who are deemed a threat but cannot be prosecuted or deported if they are a foreign national. They were first introduced in 2012 and replaced controversial control orders. Those under TPims can be subjected to electronic tagging, having to report regularly to the police and surrendering travel documents. A suspect must live at home and stay there overnight - possibly for up to 10 hours. image copyright Science Photo Library image caption Electronic tags are used to monitor the movements of criminals The suspect is allowed to use a mobile phone and the internet to work and study, subject to conditions. In 2015, TPims were toughened by granting the ability to relocate subjects up to 200 miles away from their normal residence. TPims initially last for one year, although they can be extended to two. It is possible for them to remain beyond the two-year maximum if there is suspicion of further terrorism activity. A breach of the TPims can lead to imprisonment. As of November 2016, seven people were subjected to TPims - six of whom were British citizens. Temporary Exclusion Orders Temporary Exclusion Orders (TEOs) were created by the 2015 Counter-Terrorism and Security Act. They apply to British citizens suspected of involvement in terrorist activity abroad. They are designed to stop suspects from re-entering the UK unless they give themselves up at the border. Those subjected to TEOs are only allowed to return if they make contact with the UK authorities. If they do come back, they are likely to face either prosecution or close supervision under monitoring powers. The Orders last for up to two years at a time and can be renewed. Breaches could lead to a prison sentence. The home secretary applies the TEO where they ""reasonably suspect that the subject is or has been involved in terrorism-related activity while outside the UK"". The government released details on its disruptive and investigatory powers in February. In the wake of the Manchester bombing, the Home Secretary Amber Rudd confirmed they had been used once so far. Port and border controls Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 gives the police the power to stop, search and hold individuals at ports, airports and international railway stations. Initially individuals could be questioned for up to nine hours - although a change in the guidelines means it is now up to six hours. The police also have the power to inspect electronic devices such as phones and laptops. The police do not need prior knowledge or suspicion to use Schedule 7 - although the Home Office says it's done after ""informed considerations"". A total of 23,717 people were stopped under the power in the year ending June 2016, a fall of 23% on the previous year. Despite fewer people being stopped, the number detained under the power has increased by 7%, rising from 1,649 to 1,760 in the same period.

The deluge of data launched against the site managed to briefly make it unreachable around 1200 GMT on 30 November. So far no-one has come forward to claim responsibility for the so-called denial-of-service (DoS) attack. A similar attack was launched against the main Wikileaks site prior to the public release of the first cables. Wikileaks revealed that the separate cablegate website was suffering a distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack via a message posted to its Twitter stream. The cablegate site went live on Sunday night and soon after started to suffer occasional downtime.  A DDoS attack involves swamping a site with so many requests for access that it becomes overwhelmed.  Data gathered by net monitoring firm Netcraft  showed that the cablegate site was intermittently available around Tuesday lunchtime and early afternoon because of the attack. Prior to the launch of the site, Wikileaks had taken the precaution of hosting it on three separate IP addresses to cope with any attack. ""This does not appear to have prevented the current attack from succeeding,"" wrote Paul Mutton, a security analyst at Netcraft, in a blog post He told the BBC that it was hard to work out what type of attack was under way. At the weekend before the cablegate site went live, a hacktivist known only as The Jester threatened to attack Wikileaks claiming its leak of cables would endanger US troops.  Mr Mutton said the latest attack was unlikely to be the work of The Jester as he has typically used Twitter to announce his targets. Something that was not done before the latest attack began. ""The cablegate site has only released 281 of the 251,287 leaked cables, so these attacks are likely to be symbolic action more than anything else,"" said Mr Mutton. As cablegate came under attack, a separate ongoing assault against the main Wikileaks site made it unreachable on Tuesday afternoon.

By Rebecca Coxon BBC History Published 20 December 2013 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption Whales undoubtedly have complex brains, but are they capable of acts of revenge? The revenge of a whale or an accidental tragedy? A dramatic retelling of the story that inspired Herman Melville's classic novel will be hitting our screens on BBC One this Sunday - but do whales really attack humans intentionally? Sperm whales are relatively placid mammals and very few incidents in modern times suggest otherwise. They mainly feed on squid and rarely attack, apparently only when mistaking other mammals for seals or prey.  In his 1839 book about the natural history of sperm whales, Thomas Beale, a surgeon aboard a whaleship, described them as ""a most timid and inoffensive animal readily endeavouring to escape from the slightest thing which bears an unusual appearance"". But Dr Richard Bevan, a zoologist and lecturer at Newcastle University, suggests that a sperm whale may remember if it was previously attacked. ""I have no doubt that an individual would remember being harpooned and might respond aggressively if it thought that it was threatened,"" he said. image caption Gregory Peck (front, second from right) portrayed Ahab in the 1956 film version of Moby Dick ""On the other hand a large vessel like a whaling boat would probably look like a very large threat, even to a full grown sperm whale, so I'd have thought it more likely to have moved away."" But 19th century literature seems to suggest otherwise, with numerous stories of sperm whales attacking ships on purpose. But were they fuelled by threat, hunger or, as in Melville's classic novel, even revenge? In 1820, a giant sperm whale, apparently 85 feet long (the average is 50ft) attacked a whaleship named the Essex, causing her to sink. Her crew were left adrift in three whaleboats (lighter boats used in the capture of whales) thousands of miles from land.  Alone in the middle of the Pacific Ocean the men had to decide whether to head for the nearest islands, a thousand miles downwind to the west, or set out on an epic journey of almost three thousand miles to reach the South American mainland.  Fear of cannibals forced them to choose South America, but they never made it. Of the 21 crew members aboard The Essex, just eight members of the crew were rescued after more than 80 days at sea; with an incredible tale of starvation, dehydration and unfathomable, mortal desperation to tell.  image caption Whaling was a lucrative business in the 19th Century, driven by commodities such as whale oil Two members of the crew wrote accounts of the failed voyage. First mate Owen Chase's account was a widely circulated story of the time, published just months after his return home. The other, written by cabin boy Thomas Nickerson 50 years later, was not published, but, remarkably, was discovered in an attic in 1960, 80 years after Nickerson's death. Their accounts differ in places, but what is indisputable is that they both recall exactly how their supposedly ""lucky"" ship sank. It was stove by a giant whale. Herman Melville heard this story, met with the captain of the Essex and was inspired to write his classic novel Moby Dick. Moby Dick was actually named after a real whale, Mocha Dick, first spotted by sailors in the 19th century near the island of Mocha, near southern Chile. Whales were often given pet names by sailors, Tom and Dick were common - though there are no accounts of a Harry. Mocha Dick was an albino whale, described by explorer Jerimiah N Reynolds as ""an old bull whale of prodigious size and strengthâ¦ white as wool"". Legend has it that it killed 30 men and was covered in scars and punctured with spears from previous attempts to harpoon it; before eventually being slaughtered in 1838. Sometimes described as Leviathans, sperm whales truly are creatures of mythical proportions. They have the largest teeth of any whale and live to be more than 60 years old. They can dive deeper than any other sea mammal (around 3km) in order to catch their favourite deep sea food, the elusive squid. But it is the fact that they have the largest brains on Earth, ones that are more complex - in certain ways - than those of humans, that is perhaps most surprising. Their cerebral cortex is much more convoluted than the human cortex, and they are social creatures with strong bonds, staying in stable social groupings and keeping constant companions throughout their lifespan.  Dr Lindy Weilgart, a research associate in the department of biology at Dalhousie University in Canada, believes that in order ""to remember all their complex social relationships (families, more distantly related kin, non-related group members), they require a good memory"". In fact, remembering traumatic past incidents could well have been the trigger for the whale that rammed the Essex. ""Briefly, I do believe a sperm whale is capable of the aggression necessary to attack a ship, especially a mother if her young was threatened,"" Dr Weilgart says. ""I know whalers in general often harpooned calves but kept them alive so as to attract the rest of the family group which came in aid of the calf."" ""They then harpooned those adults"", she says, a practice that was ""particularly cruel"". However, Dr Bevan suggests that while ""the cetaceans do have large brainsâ¦ this is linked to their ability to process sound rather than being linked to what we regard as intelligence"". Whether they can feel emotions like vengeance, is in dispute. It is possible that the whale changed course underwater at the last minute and unwittingly collided with the ship.  image caption The Whale on BBC One tells the story of the ill-fated voyage of The Essex Dr Per Berggren, a lecturer in marine science at Newcastle University and specialist in marine mammals, believes this to be nearer the truth.  ""It is perhaps more likely that the ship accidentally hit the whale and sustained a leak large enough to sink the vessel."" But what is remarkable in the case of the Essex sinking, is that the whale came back to strike a second time.  First Mate Chase recalled: ""I turned around and saw himâ¦ directly ahead of us, coming down with twice his ordinary speedâ¦ with ten-fold fury and vengeance in his aspect.  ""The surf flew in all directions about him with the continual violent thrashing of his tail. His head about half out of the water, and in that way he came upon us, and again struck the ship. ""The ship brought up as suddenly and violently as if she had struck a rock and trembled for a few minutes like a leaf.""  Latest research shows that whales are self-aware, sentient and more intelligent than previously thought. They can feel pain and suffering and therefore potentially a level of cognitive function; it is also now thought they can even experience feelings of love. image caption Tilikum, a captive orca, was involved in the death of a trainer in 2010 Sperm whales do not have many predators, killer whales (orcas) are known to have attacked sperm whales and occasionally sharks; but since the early 1700s by a large the most serious predator of sperm whales has been homo sapiens.  Whaling in the 19th century was a lucrative business as whale oil became immensely valuable for lighting oil lamps and making candles and soaps. More than 900 whaleships were out to sea in the mid-1800s, hailing mainly from American ports, with an average voyage length of three or four years.  By the mid 19th century, whale numbers were depleting rapidly. But with the discovery of petroleum in Pennsylvania in 1859, the American whaling industry had almost completely disappeared by the start of World War I.  Whale hunting is now illegal in most parts of the world (though still practised by some nations such as Norway and Japan) and concerns about the welfare of whales in captivity are currently making waves in the news.  The documentary film Blackfish, about an orca in captivity at SeaWorld Orlando that was involved in several deaths, has recently caused controversy for the theme park. The documentary suggests that keeping the whales in captivity may be causing them to behave psychotically. Acts including Willie Nelson and Barenaked Ladies have recently cancelled performances at the park in the wake of the film's release. But SeaWorld has issued a detailed rebuttal of claims in the film. When First Mate Starbuck declares to Captain Ahab that ""Moby Dick seeks thee not. It is thou, thou, that madly seekest him!"" it's likely he was telling an awful and haunting truth.  Whether or not the sperm whale that attacked the whaleship Essex on the night of 20 November 1820 did so on purpose, we will never know. But the fascinating and undying rumour of his revenge certainly lives on. The Whale will be shown on BBC One on Sunday 22nd December at 9pm.

Anthony Zurcher North America reporter @awzurcher on Twitter Published 1 November 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics New York truck attack media caption Trump on New York terror suspect: 'Send him to Gitmo' As presidential candidate, Donald Trump made being tough on what he called ""radical Islamic terror"" a central plank of his election bid. How has he responded to the first test of this nature since taking office? In the immediate aftermath of the attack in New York on Tuesday evening, Donald Trump offered a measured reaction. His White House released a statement offering ""thoughts and prayers"", praising first responders and pledging federal support for the ongoing investigation.  The president tweeted that that the perpetrator was a ""very sick and deranged person"" - the same words he used to describe the man who  killed more than 50 people  in Las Vegas a month ago.  There were hints of what was to come, however. He tweeted about not allowing ""ISIS to return, or enter, our country"", and another about stepping up his ""extreme vetting"" border security programme. Then, on Wednesday morning, the dam broke. These are some interesting points about what followed. Partisan swipes The president lashed out against Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer - who represents the state where the attack took place - for supporting an immigration lottery system that gives residency to 50,000 applicants from nations that do not send many of their citizens to the US. He called on Congress to end the Diversity Visa Lottery Program, calling it ""a Chuck Schumer beauty"", although the system was set up in 1990 law that was passed with broad bipartisan support and signed by Republican President George HW Bush.  As Republican Senator Jeff Flake pointed out on Twitter, Mr Schumer was among a bipartisan group who recently tried to change the programme as part of comprehensive immigration reform. Mr Trump also tweeted that Mr Schumer was trying to ""import Europes [sic] problems"", which prompted a dry response from the senator. media caption New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov? ""I guess it's not too soon to politicise a tragedy,""  he tweeted . Trump supporters have been quick to throw the hypocrisy flag on their ideological counterparts as well.  ""Still waiting for liberal calls for immigration bans/reform like they do every time there's a gun attack,"" Donald Trump Jr, the president's eldest son,  tweeted . ""Maybe hungover from Halloween?"" Since the president's criticisms, Mr Schumer has countered with his own policy recommendations - urging the president to back away from proposed budget cuts to anti-terrorism programmes. ""Our city relies on it to snuff out attacks,""  he tweeted . It took less than 24 for hours for this latest incident to become drenched in politics. A change of course In the aftermath of the devastating hurricanes that hit the US earlier this year and the Las Vegas attack in September, the White House had cautioned that heated debates about politics and policy should be delayed. ""To have any kind of focus on the cause and effect of the storm; versus helping people, or actually facing the effect of the storm, is misplaced,"" Environmental Protection Agency head Scott Pruitt  said  in response to a question about climate change was Hurricane Irma headed toward the Florida coast. ""There will certainly be a time for that policy discussion to take place, but that's not the place that we're in at this moment"" Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said the day after the Nevada mass shooting, the largest in modern US history. When asked why Mr Trump had suggested that his proposed travel ban was necessary shortly after the Orlando nightclub shooting in 2016, Sanders replied that ""there's a difference between being a candidate and being the president"".  When it came to the New York attack, however, President Trump followed the Orlando route. Different attacks, a different response The president's comments on Wednesday  stands in marked contrast to his reaction to other domestic terror attacks that have occurred during his presidency.  After a white nationalist in Charlottesville drove a car into a crowd of counter-protesters, killing one, Mr Trump explained that he delayed commenting because ""unlike other politicians"", he wanted to make sure he knew all the facts before assigning blame. ""I don't want to go quickly and just make a statement for the sake of making a political statement,"" he said. media caption What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter But the president's critics have pointed out his reticence when attacks involve perpetrators who are not Muslims. He has not spoken at all about a man who  was arrested  on 6 October for trying to plant a nail bomb at an airport in Asheville, North Carolina. The suspect told police he wanted to ""fight a war on US soil"". Mr Trump also  held his tongue when another man  was arrested  on terrorism charges on 19 October for detonating a bomb in a parking lot in Williamsburg, Virginia.  For the president, it seems, the New York attack - like the Orlando mass shooting - merited a different response. The Fox factor So what changed between Tuesday night and Wednesday morning?  Mr Trump always seems to be at his most rambunctious on Twitter in the morning - in part because he likes to spend the time watching his favourite news programme, Fox & Friends. On Wednesday the show featured guests - including former White House adviser Sebastian Gorka and retired Lt Colonel Tony Shaffer - who repeatedly laid the blame for the New York attacks on US immigration policies they said were backed by Mr Schumer and Democrats.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Donald Trump has called Fox & Friends one of his favourite news programmes The president followed the show's lead. In two of his tweets, he included the Fox & Friends Twitter handle.  It has become a recurring occurrence during the Trump presidency. The Fox News morning show runs a segment on a controversial topic, and the president quickly fires off tweets on a similar theme. Whether the subject is flag-burning, NFL protests, Confederate monuments, healthcare, immigration, Fox & Friends has become a window into the president's mind and a preview of tweets to come. Wednesday morning was only the latest example. Related Topics New York truck attack Donald Trump"

Luca Attanasio, 43, died in hospital on Monday after the United Nations convoy he was travelling in came under fire near Goma, a statement said. The convoy reportedly belonged to the UN's World Food Programme (WFP). An Italian military police officer travelling with the envoy and a Congolese driver were also killed. ""It is with deep sadness that the foreign ministry confirms the death, today in Goma, of the Italian ambassador,"" the ministry's statement said. On patrol: Night vision in DR Congo The attack in North Kivu province is believed to have been an attempted kidnapping, according to officials at the nearby Virunga National Park. What do we know about the attack? Mr Attanasio was a passenger in one of two vehicles travelling about 15km (nine miles) north of Goma when the attack happened on Monday morning.  The vehicles were ""ambushed by a group of six attackers, who fired warning shots before taking all the passengers into the Virunga National Park"", the governor of North Kivu province, Carly Nzanzu, told the BBC. image copyright Reuters image caption Security forces guard the area where the attack took place on Monday morning ""That's when a patrol of Virunga National Park rangers intervened and managed to free four people,"" he said.  ""Unfortunately, before they ran away, the assailants shot the ambassador and his bodyguard, and they killed the Congolese driver at the start of the attack,"" the governor added. image copyright Getty Images image caption Virunga is regarded as one of the most dangerous parks in Africa The WFP said Mr Attanasio was travelling from Goma to visit a ""schools programme"" in the village of Rutshuru in eastern DR Congo.  "" The attack... occurred on a road that had previously been cleared for travel  without security escorts,"" the Rome-based agency said in a statement. The two other fatalities were military police officer Vittorio Iacovacci, 30, who had been serving at the embassy since last September, and their Congolese driver, who has been named as Moustapha Milambo in media reports. A number of other passengers were reportedly injured.  It is not clear who was behind the attack, but the interior ministry has accused a Hutu rebel group known as the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR).  Many armed groups are known to operate in and around the park and militias clash regularly in the east of the country, where a large UN force is struggling to keep the peace. The DRC army has deployed troops to help search the area. Questions over apparent security lapse Analysis by Emery Makumeno, BBC News, Kinshasa  Mr Attanasio is the first ambassador to be killed in the country since French ambassador Philippe Bernard was shot dead during riots in the capital, Kinshasa, in 1997.  Normally, aid convoys travelling in eastern DR Congo are heavily guarded by UN troops, and questions are bound to be asked about the level of security that Mr Attanasio's convoy had. He was travelling in the east - the most unstable part of DR Congo. Many local armed groups - as well as those from Rwanda, Burundi, the Central African Republic (CAR) and Uganda - have established themselves in the region over the last 25 years.  The attack highlights the fact that stability to the region will return only if a solution is found to political issues in all these countries.  What has the reaction been? Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi issued a statement offering his ""deepest condolences"", while President Sergio Mattarella condemned the ""cowardly attack"". Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio expressed his ""great shock and immense sorrow"" at the ""brutal"" killings. ""Today Italy mourns the loss of two of its sons and embraces their families,"" he said, adding: ""No effort will be spared to shed light on what happened.""  DR Congo's Foreign Minister, Marie Tumba Nzeza, said an investigation into the killings was under way.  Mr Attanasio had represented Italy in the DR Congo since 2017. He joined the diplomatic service in 2003 and spent time in Morocco and Nigeria. What is the situation in DR Congo? DR Congo was for many years at the centre of a brutal civil war  that drew in several neighbouring countries.  The conflict led to the loss of some five million lives between 1994 and 2003, with some observers branding it Africa's Great War. But the end of the conflict did not mark an end to the violence. Dozens of militias and rebel groups continue to operate in eastern areas. The UN's peacekeeping mission has been in DR Congo since 1999. It is one of the biggest peacekeeping operations in the world, with more than 17,000 personnel on the ground. Virunga - which stretches across 7,800 sq km (3,000 sq miles) - is one of the most dangerous parks on the continent. Gorillas, guns and guerrillas - a deadly mix in an African park In 2018, a ranger was killed and three people - including two British tourists - were kidnapped when their vehicle was ambushed in the Virunga National Park.

The Slovenia-based firm said the culprits had exploited a bug in the virtual currency's underlying software to carry out the assault. It is the second exchange to suspend operations. Tokyo's MtGox took a similar measure on Friday. A third, Bulgaria's BTC-e, has  warned that some transactions  may be delayed. Like Bitstamp, it cited a denial-of-service (DoS) attack as the cause. image copyright Bitstamp image caption Bitstamp is the second exchange to halt withdrawal of bitcoins The Bitcoin Foundation - a group of developers who maintain and promote the cryptographic code on which the currency relies - said that it was creating workarounds and fixes to tackle the issue. It added that people who had funds stored with the affected exchanges should know that their savings were safe, albeit ""tied up"" for the time being. ""This is a denial-of-service attack; whoever is doing this is not stealing coins, but is succeeding in preventing some transactions from confirming,""  wrote Gavin Andresen , chief scientist at the foundation. ""It's important to note that DoS attacks do not affect people's Bitcoin wallets or funds."" Mutated IDs The cause of the problem is an issue  called transaction malleability . It involves someone changing the cryptographic code - known as a transaction hash - used to create an ID for the exchange of funds before it is recorded in the blockchain - a database of every transaction carried out in the currency. On Monday, MtGox  had suggested that  this technique could be used to fool its systems into repeatedly making a payout because it would seem that it had not occurred. The Bitcoin Foundation's initial response was that transaction malleability had been known about since 2011, and that MtGox should have prepared for this when developing its own customised software, which was now proving vulnerable. ""This is something that cannot be corrected overnight,""  wrote Mr Andresen . But while other exchanges are not complaining about the risk of making unauthorised payouts, it appears their systems can become overwhelmed if they receive too many ""mutated versions"" of the transaction IDs. ""This is a denial-of-service attack made possible by some misunderstandings in Bitcoin wallet implementations,""  said Bitstamp's blog . ""These misunderstandings have simple solutions that are being implemented as we speak, and we're confident everything will be back to normal shortly."" The Bitcoin Foundation now says its members and developers from a number of exchanges are working ""collectively and collaboratively"" to tackle the problem and allow withdrawals to resume. 'Wake-up call' One bitcoin is currently trading for about $665 (Â£402). That is well below the $830 level it was at last Thursday, reflecting investors' concern at the news. However, one expert said the virtual currency should emerge from the attacks more robust than before. image copyright Getty Images image caption Bitcoin was trading for a high as $1,242 last year ""Obviously it's a bit more serious than was initially thought - it was originally believed that it was just a problem at MtGox because of the way they had set up their systems,"" Emily Spaven, editor of the news site Coindesk, told the BBC. ""The view from developers is that the exchanges should be processing bitcoin withdrawals again within 48-72 hours, though the wider issue of transaction malleability will take longer to address. ""It's been a bit of a wake-up call to get this issue fixed. I suppose they previously thought it wasn't that big a deal.""

The hacker briefly increased the amount of sodium hydroxide (lye) in Oldsmar's water treatment system, but a worker spotted it and reversed the action. Lye is used in small amounts to control acidity but a large amount could have caused major problems in the water. Oldsmar Mayor Eric Seidel said: ""There's a bad actor out there."" No arrests have yet been made and it is not known if the hack was done from within the US or outside. A computer controlling Oldsmar's water treatment system was remotely accessed on Friday. A plant operator saw an attempt to access the system in the morning but assumed it was his supervisor,  the Tampa Bay Times reported . But another attempt was made early in the afternoon and this time the hacker accessed the treatment software and increased the sodium hydroxide content from 100 parts per million to 11,100 ppm. The operator immediately reduced the level to normal. Sodium hydroxide is the chief ingredient in liquid drain cleaners. It is very corrosive and can cause irritation to the skin and eyes, along with temporary loss of hair. Swallowing it can cause damage to the mouth, throat and stomach and induce vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said: ""I'm not a chemist. But I can tell you what I do know is... if you put that amount of that substance into the drinking water, it's not a good thing."" But he added: ""At no time was there a significant adverse effect on the water being treated. Importantly, the public was never in danger."" The Oldsmar plant provides water to businesses and about 15,000 residents. The remote access programme to the water system has been temporarily disabled. 'Bad actors out there' Analysis by Joe Tidy, cyber reporter Imagine the horror as this worker watched their own mouse cursor being moved around the screen by an invisible hand. Then seeing it click open and adjust the electronic dials to poison the water. Perhaps more terrifying is that this isn't the first time it's happened. In 2016, a security report from Verizon detailed a similar attack on another unnamed US water facility. And in 2020 there were multiple unsuccessful hacks on Israeli water supplies. This latest attack in Florida will do nothing to calm cyber-security experts who've been warning for years that so called ""critical national infrastructure"" facilities are being targeted. Water, electricity, nuclear plants and transport are being probed for weaknesses all the time not just because of the potential for mass disruption but also because they are often running on out-of-date and vulnerable IT systems.  So far all attacks on water supplies have been averted. But as Mayor Seidel put it in his press conference, this is an event that ""puts everyone on notice: these types of bad actors are out there and this is happening"". media caption Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody Related Topics Water pollution Florida United States Water Computer hacking More on this story US city warned over brain-eating microbe in water Published 27 September 2020 Flint, Michigan: Life in a poisoned city Published 22 January 2016"

Labour's Charlotte Nichols said she had been increasingly targeted since winning her Warrington North seat at the 2019 general election. Earlier this month, she shared a tweet from a Tory candidate for the town's council which used Nazi terminology. The Conservatives said the woman had been suspended from the party.  Ms Nichols, who was promoted to shadow women and equalities minister in November, spoke out after sharing a screenshot of a Twitter exchange from February 2020 with Sharon Thomason, who was later selected as a council candidate by the Conservatives. She had replied to a post from Ms Nichols, making reference to ""the Aryan race"", a term used by Nazis to refer to a group of people they believed to be superior to other races. Ms Nichols' sharing of the exchange on 3 February prompted Labour's deputy leader Angela Rayner to say she was ""horrified that someone who has publicly promoted these views has been selected as a Conservative Party candidate"". 'Looking into all allegations' Since being shown the tweet, the Conservatives said Ms Thomason had been ""suspended from the party and is no longer a member"".  ""Ms Thomason will no longer be standing as a Conservative candidate in the local elections."" Cheshire Police confirmed it was investigating the posts after receiving a third-party report of an offensive social media message. In a letter to Ms Nichols, the Tory co-chairman Amanda Milling MP apologised and stated that the party's complaints team was ""looking into all allegations against Warrington Conservatives"". 'MPs are human beings' Ms Nichols said the level of abuse she had faced online and in post since becoming an MP was so large, she had had to put ""things in place that mean that I don't see the majority of what I get sent"".  She said while there was an argument to say ""a level of abuse in public life is the price we have to pay for doing the job that we do"", she had been shocked by attacks on her loved ones. ""Dad didn't sign up to that, my ex didn't sign up to it, my sisters didn't sign up to it,"" she said. ""So when they get sent stuff or are talked about by people as a way of getting at me, that's the bit that really hurts because they didn't sign up to this life; I did.  ""I think people on all sides of the political spectrum can be guilty of forgetting that MPs are human beings with the same sort of feelings, struggles and aspirations as anyone else."" She said the abuse had led to her having ""a panic button in every room"" of her house.

A black policeman in New York for decades before his retirement, the former officer, 60, tells the BBC: ""It's the chickens coming home to roost"".  ""This is something that's been mustering for a while,"" says Mr Billups. Not for the first time has anger against law enforcement in America spilt out into demands for change - national attempts to reform the country's patchwork of nearly 18,000 police departments have periodically cropped up since the early 20th Century. But outrage over a spate of deaths of black Americans at the hands of police, especially the death of George Floyd, a former club bouncer asphyxiated during an arrest, has spurred a clear bout of soul-searching within police departments themselves. Officers are divided over if and how reforms should come about.  For Mr Billups, now chairman of the Grand Council of Guardians, an organisation for African-American law enforcement officers in New York state, the problems lie at the top. 'Old-school thinking'  A policy of tough policing put forward in the 1980s, the so-called ""broken windows"" theory, has long been destructive for relations between minorities and law enforcement, Mr Billups says. image copyright East Bay Times via Getty Images image caption Richmond, California police officers stand with anti-racism protesters Only recently have authorities begun to step away from more draconian principles, but Mr Billups thinks that a belief in the efficacy of tough tactics persists among the mostly white, and long-entrenched, leadership of many police departments.  ""The head is the thinker. The body's going to conform to the head. If the head is not healthy, the body's not going to gain weight. ""You gotta change the top,"" says Mr Billups. ""It's a large number of [people who believe in] old-school policing that's still running a lot of these agencies, and the old-school way of thinking just doesn't work no more."" Black officers have always known and felt differently, says Terence Hopkins of the Dallas police department.  ""We happen to be African-American people before we were law enforcement,"" he says, ""so that gives us a different view as opposed to our white counterparts."" What's changed since George Floyd's death? Surveys bear this out. A 2016 poll of nearly 8,000 US police oficers by the Pew Research think tank found that 69% of black officers believed that the country needed to ""continue making changes to give blacks equal rights with whites"", compared to just 6% of white officers. The survey, taken in the aftermath of another spate of fatal encounters between police and African-Americans, found that a majority of white and Latino officers believed such events were isolated incidents. media caption Eric Garner's death inspires an unlikely police experiment By contrast, 57% of black officers said they were signs of a broader problem with policing. Polls of police in the wake of the recent fatal encounters have yet to emerge, but anecdotally, more officers today seem to agree that the problem goes beyond individuals and needs a systematic approach. White as well as black officers have supported the protests and have publicly called for reforms.  Change v status quo ""What's happening now is a movement for police reform in our country,"" says Mr Hopkins, who has been a police officer for 30 years. Officer to be fired over Breonna Taylor shooting Timeline of US police killings Some of the ideas that have become popular in the larger cultural conversation, such as diverting money and duties to fund mental health and social work, he agrees with wholeheartedly, he says.  More must be done to recruit minority officers. In Dallas, there is a conscious policy to make the force reflect the demographics of the city it serves.  But Mr Hopkins says he also understands why there is resistance to change. media caption Antonio Smith is suing the city of Valdosta, Georgia, and its police department over a violent wrongful arrest ""You tend to be protective of your industry. When individuals say, 'you're doing something wrong,' we tend to go the other direction, or not admit our fault in it.""  Mr Billups agrees that ""it's a big split. You have one faction that's saying there's a need for change, and then you have another faction in these departments that want to keep it as status quo."" image copyright Boston Globe via Getty Images image caption Some police have joined protesters in taking a knee in commemoration of George Floyd Some officers have expressed anger over the backlash on policing and calls to defund or disband departments (though these are not always calls to abolish police, as some have taken them to mean).  A viral video circulated in recent weeks of members of the New York Benevolent Association, seen as a traditionally more conservative union for rank-and-file officers, venting at perceived mistreatment of police amid the protests. ""Stop treating us like 'animals' and 'thugs',"" Mike O'Meara, head of the union, tells reporters. ""I am not Derek Chauvin. They are not him,"" he said referring to the police officer who killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. ""Everybody's trying to shame us. The legislators. The press. Everybody's trying to shame us into being embarrassed of our profession,"" he says. ""We've been left out of the conversation. We've been vilified. It's disgusting."" On Facebook, Blue Lives Matter - a counter group to Black Lives Matter that advocates for police interest - has over 2.2m endorsers. media caption What happened when a city disbanded its police force Supporters say police deserve sympathy for doing a difficult job, and that ""radical"" proposals to disband departments would lead to anarchy and lawlessness.  Indeed, such reforms can have mixed results. Camden, a working-class town in New Jersey, has been hailed as a model for success after disbanding its troubled police force in 2013, redirecting energies to neighbourhood patrolling.  However, in Vallejo, California, outside San Francisco, fatal encounters with police rose dramatically in the years after it disbanded force, in 2008.  ""It's just really tough,"" says Robert McCormick, a retired police and parole officer. ""Everybody wants a simple answer, but there isn't one."" There are many complexities even with reforms that sound reasonable, he points out.  For example, getting mental health specialists to deal with issues police are not equipped to deal with - a large chunk of calls Mr McCormick, 72, saw in his decades on the job in the Midwest and Colorado - would seem prudent.  But officers would have no way of knowing when they answer an emergency ""911"" call that mental illness is the issue at hand.  Police kill Canadian man during mental health check Don't shoot, I'm disabled - how to stop deaths involving police With nearly one in three Americans owning a gun, risks for officers can be high.  Rather than reducing funds, Mr McCormick thinks, there should be supplemental funds for training and alternative resources for police.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Protesters call for spending on police departments to be cut He thinks protections for police do need to remain in place, such as preserving ""qualified immunity"" - another concept that has come under pressure amid the recent protests.  The doctrine shields officers from being held personally liable for violating the constitutional rights of people they arrest.  Critics argue that this thwarts attempts to hold officers accountable, but Mr McCormick says it is necessary to protect police who are trying to do their jobs. ""It says you can't sue me just for arresting you, just for doing my job,"" he says.  ""[The police] are being attacked,"" he says. ""But [on the other hand], it's so damned hard to get rid of a cop who's bad or not doing his jobâ¦ it's pretty damn near impossible to convict a cop. That's ridiculous."" Ultimately, it will be changes that take place within departments themselves that affect long-term results, thinks the Grand Council's Mr Billups.  ""The key thing now is that there's changes in the department,"" he says. ""You're talking about officers who are black or Latino. They go back to those same neighbourhoods where they're policing. [So] a lot of the young black officers see it a different way."" But more importantly, he says, it is that police departments as a whole need to ""learn a new language"" to evaluate the purpose and priorities of the job. ""Departments need to evolve to the 21st Century"".  Cops Need a New Code Jeremiah Johnson serves as a police sergeant in Connecticut and holds an appointment as a Practitioner in Residence at the University of New Haven It took several days before I could bring myself to watch George Floyd's life agonisingly extinguished beneath the unyielding knee of a Minneapolis police officer. As a sworn police officer, I believe it is my duty to watch and not look away; George Floyd's humanity demands it.  His unconscionable death laid bare the deficiencies of American policing, a reality which resonated with cities and communities across the nation. Viral images and video clips documenting protests against racism and brutality have done little to disconfirm that the police are racist and brutal. Calls to re-imagine, defund, or even abolish the institution of policing are amplified through these encounters.  A friend from my undergraduate days recently lamented on Facebook that she did not know how to explain the police to her children. Rhetorical or not, I inquired whether she meant ""police as they are"" or ""police as they should be?""  Policing is a social institution with an uncertain mandate and mismatched expectations invariably leads to conflict. Reductionist phrases such as ""to serve and protect"" are of little help as they are ambiguous and easily co-opted.  The field of policing desperately needs to do some soul-searching and reconsider what it stands for professionally. Rewriting its code of ethics is a good place to start. The current Law Enforcement Code of Ethics is a product of the mid-20th Century's professional era of policing. It was formally adopted by the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 1957.  The document is more than symbolic; many police organisations (including the Minneapolis Police Department) have incorporated the Code of Ethics into their policy manuals and oath of office ceremonies. Police reform often takes place in a patchwork fashion.  Changing the Code of Ethics would be unprecedented and wide-reaching. To draft a new Code of Ethics worthy of a democratic society, policing should turn to Hippocrates. Medicine's Hippocratic Oath is commonly summarised as ""do no harm"".  It is the physician's job to examine the patient, diagnose the medical condition underlying presenting symptoms, and prescribe an effective course of treatment. A doctor who only attends to visible symptoms, provides ineffective medicine, or treats in a manner that is ultimately harmful has failed the patient.  By these standards, American policing may be guilty of malpractice.  A police code of ethics designed around the Hippocratic Oath should incorporate four key themes that are noticeably absent from the present document: evidence-based policing; crime prevention; professional identity; and the sanctity of life.; In the decades following the code's inception, a vast body of scientific evidence has emerged regarding what works in policing and, perhaps more importantly, what does not.  This is not an abstract intellectual issue since police interventions directly impact the lives of community members. Ignoring the evidence base in favour of tradition or personal opinion is more than irresponsible; unscientific policing is unethical policing.   Second, the Code of Ethics is a product of the crime-control era and is singularly focused on enforcement. The desire to apprehend is dominant in American policing's DNA, yet this orientation must give way to crime prevention. It is the absence of crime and disorder that policing should seek to achieve.   Third, the Code of Ethics must repudiate the ideology of the ""thin blue line"". It must clearly establish that police are first and foremost members of the community, not some separate caste standing in the gap between good and evil. Finally, the Code of Ethics rightly speaks to protecting the weak and innocent while opposing unnecessary force and violence. This does not go far enough.  Policing must fundamentally acknowledge the sanctity of life and a duty to protect every person, even individuals who have placed themselves or others in jeopardy. If police must use force, they have an ethical duty to transition and render aid to prevent the loss of life. As George Floyd lay dying, one of the bystanders in the crowd tried to reason with the officers declaring, ""Bro, he's human."" The appeal fell on deaf ears.  Hippocrates viewed the art of medicine as something fundamentally connected with the love of humanity. The very fabric of American policing must change before the same can be said about law enforcement. It's time for a new code.

The police inspectorate warned in November 2016 that ""an over-reliance"" on the officer in charge of the response could see them overwhelmed. Policing experts believe that is what happened after the May 2017 attack. A former inspector told the inquiry Greater Manchester Police (GMP) was urged to ""raise its game"" at the time. The public inquiry into the atrocity, which killed 22 people as they left an Ariana Grande concert, has been hearing about inspections of GMP around the time of the attack. It has previously heard only one paramedic was in the City Room foyer, where bomber Salman Abedi detonated his device, for the first 40 minutes after the blast and the first fire engine arrived more than two hours after the explosion. 'Apparent vagueness' Andrew Buchan, who worked as an inspector with HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire & Rescue Services, said it was identified in 2016 that GMP's plan was ""very tactically focused"". But he said it did not go into detail about working with other agencies and had placed ""an over-reliance"" on the ""force duty inspector (FDO) to lead their response to a terrorist attack"". The inspectorate's report said the number of tasks the officer would be ""expected to perform in all likelihood are so many that it may be some will not be completed or at least in the order expected"", the inquiry heard. It said the force had acknowledged that the pressures the officer would be placed under would ""bring its own challenges"", but the matter was left unresolved. It added that ""such apparent vagueness may cause confusion or doubt in a live scenario"" and there was a need ""to provide the FDO with more immediate support or resources to assist with all the functions expected of that role"". image copyright PA Media image caption The public inquiry into the bombing is considering whether the attack could have been prevented Mr Buchan said the watchdog spoke to four duty inspectors at GMP, who said they had received no counter-terrorism training and ""felt ill prepared for that eventuality"" but would draw on the experience of other critical incidents. The inquiry heard unarmed officers, who were likely to be the first on the scene, were said to be unaware of GMP's counter-terrorism plans and did not know where to find them. It was told that none of the officers who spoke to the watchdog knew exactly what they would have to do in the event of a terrorist incident.  The inquiry heard staff in GMP's control room had received no specific training to help them do their job during a terror attack.  Mr Buchan said the force had been told it ""needed to raise its game"" in testing and training control room and unarmed staff before ""the awful time when a terrorist attack actually happens"".  He said that in November 2016, he personally spoke to a senior GMP officer to share the shortcomings found in their inspection report, which he added were issues found in other forces throughout England and Wales.  The final report into UK counter-terrorism policing was never publically published due to national security reasons.  The inquiry continues.

Posters for the FBI's ""Most Wanted Fugitives"" were once plastered on the walls of post offices, says Steven Pomerantz, a retired FBI official who previously served as head of the bureau's counterterrorism section. These kind of public-outreach programmes work well, he says. In the mid-1990s, one of these FBI programmes led to the capture of Theodore Kaczynski, a Montana man known as the Unabomber who mailed explosives to individuals, killing three people. FBI officials decided to release to the public a manifesto that he wrote. His brother and sister-in-law recognised his ideas in the text and turned him in. Since then, citizen-sleuths have become more sophisticated. Activist Shaun King, known for his aggressive use of online tools to pursue criminals, went after some of the people who infiltrated the Capitol building.

People described them as suspects, even though they had nothing to do with the attacks.

When Tracey Hanson's son, Josh, was stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack in 2015, it was the start of a tough journey through the criminal justice system. She said she was ""passed from pillar to post"" throughout and the impact stays with her today. Experiences like hers - and others who have been victims of crime - is driving a fresh call from Labour for a ""Victims' Law"" to strengthen their rights.  Labour's shadow victims minister, Peter Kyle, said for ""too long"", those who suffer have been ""forgotten and squeezed out"" by the system.  A spokesman from the Ministry of Justice said a new version of the Victims' Code, coming into force in April, will ""boost the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process"", and legislation will follow ""later this year"".  Crimes unreported as public lose faith in police Older victims of crime not cared for well enough, says report London's forgotten victims of violent crime Josh was 21 when he was stabbed in a bar in London, which led to what his mum described as a ""re-traumatising"" experience with the criminal justice system where ""you suffer unnecessarily over and over again"". She said: ""You're turning to the very resources that you've always believed, as a citizen, are there for you to help you at your time of need.  ""When you're desperately in need of that help and support, and it's not forthcoming. Honestly, it's just absolutely horrific. I can't tell you the number of experiences I've had, but some are just inhumane."" image copyright Metropolitan Police image caption Josh Hanson was stabbed in London in 2015 One incident that has stayed with Tracey happened just days after her son's death, when she went to see him in the mortuary. At this traumatising time, she was asked to sign forms deciding what to do with cells and tissue from his body. ""I was asked to sign that on the day that I was seeing my son in a mortuary for the first time, seeing my son's body laid out,"" she said.  ""Imagine that. I mean, I would have signed my house away, I would have signed anything.  ""I had no recollection of that experience until three-and-a-half years later when I started to think about getting Josh's clothes."" Tracey said she was then told by email that she had signed the forms and his tissue had been destroyed. She had also not been given her own copy of the document. ""The mortuary keeps a copy, the coroner, the police keep a copy, but you as a victim, who has signed an extremely important document, you're not even given a copy because there isn't one for you,"" she said.  ""Where's the victim's rights in that?"" Tracey now helps other victims of crime, alongside campaigning for a change in the law on unduly lenient sentences, as she knows her experience is far from unique.  Victims' code All victims of crime have a set of rights set out in the Victims' Code, which includes a right to information and the right to make a victim impact statement. But the Crime Survey of England and Wales found that in 2017-18, only one-in-five victims had heard of it.  The code has recently been updated and the new version comes into effect on 1 April 2021. But despite  successive Conservative governments pledging to enshrine the rights into law  since 2015, legislation has yet to be put to Parliament.  Labour's Mr Kyle is increasing the pressure by introducing his own Victims' Bill to Parliament, saying putting the code on a legal footing is the ""baseline"" - with any law needing to go much further. He said that ""too often... there is no link between the victim and the system"", which can lead to cases failing, and while it was not the fault of individuals working for criminal justice, it must be addressed. ""We have a system that, unfortunately, has focused so much on their part in bringing people to justice that it's forgotten and squeezed out the victims themselves,"" said the Labour MP. ""I think that our criminal justice system will never be able to deliver the justice that's deserved, and make sure that victims feel that justice has been done for them, unless we can reconnect victims to the criminal justice system itself. "" Mr Kyle said his bill would introduce ""consequences"" into the system to make victims' rights ""un-ignorable"". What would Labour's Victims' Law include? image copyright Getty Images Ensuring victims are read their rights at the same time as perpetrators Creating a register for people who run departments in the justice system which routinely ignore victims' rights Giving victims of persistent anti-social behaviour the same rights as victims of crimes Making the Victims' Commissioner independent of government and able to launch their own investigations The Conservatives promised again in their manifesto at the 2019 election to introduce a Victims' Law. But Vera Baird QC, the Victims' Commissioner for England and Wales, said the need for a law ""really gets more urgent as time goes by"". She said there had been ""a significant fall in confidence about the criminal justice system from victims"", and she saw the results in her office ""day to day"".  Ms Baird added: ""We urgently need victims' rights to be put into law.  ""They are not hard to do and they don't attack the defendant's rights in any way, but a Victims' Law is now critically urgent."" 'Build back confidence' Asked about Labour's push for the law, a spokesman for the Ministry of Justice said: ""Our new Victims' Code boosts the rights of victims at every stage of the justice process and we will strengthen these further by consulting on legislation later this year. ""We are also investing millions in vital support services while recruiting 20,000 more police officers to build back confidence in the justice system."" It is also understood the consultation will consider how the role of the Victims' Commissioner can be strengthened further. Related Topics Peter Kyle Labour Party Ministry of Justice Crime"

But it comes amid unhappiness at how the university is remembering the attack.  Using augmented reality the students projected her words onto the site on campus where she was assaulted in 2015.  The area has been turned into a contemplative garden - but there was a disagreement over the choice of words for a plaque and it was never installed. Students fear this means people now don't know what the garden signifies. The Dear Visitor exhibit saw people using iPads and headphones to see and hear the words Ms Miller wrote to attacker Brock Turner in her victim impact statement.  It was written under the pseudonym Emily Doe and went viral after being published online.   Chanel Miller tells her story A jury found Turner, then 20, guilty of three charges: sexually assaulting an intoxicated victim, sexually assaulting an unconscious victim and attempting to rape her. Ms Miller was found near a dumpster by two Swedish students. Turner was given a controversially short six-month jail term, of which he served three months. He was placed on probation and remains on the sex offenders' register.  image copyright Dear Visitor There is currently no plaque and no plans to install one after the university rejected the words Ms Miller chose to be used.   The creators of  Dear Visitor  - all students or former students at Stanford - wanted Friday's augmented reality project, followed by a solidarity event, to go some way towards righting that wrong. 'Window to alternative world' Hope Schroeder said: ""We want to elevate Chanel Miller's voice in this space as was intended. It's not a replacement but an addition to a physical plaque."" She said there were also fears the site was not being used as intended - with beer cans and vape cartridges found in the garden - and that its meaning could be forgotten.  The exhibit involved students being given iPads equipped with an augmented reality app to allow them to see what it would look like if a plaque had been installed in the garden.  ""It gives them a window to an alternative world,"" she said. ""We were able to install digital objects that look like they're there. ""We also took the opportunity to interview students about the issue. We thought there was a risk as time goes on, students in five or 10 years could not know what the garden was about. So students' letters can be clicked on as well. We then invite people to write letters of their own.""  image copyright Dear Visitor image caption The augmented reality plaque - the final version saw the name Emily Doe replaced with Chanel Miller image copyright Dear Visitor The Dear Visitor team contacted Ms Miller, whose memoir Know My Name was released this week, to get her go-ahead for the project.  ""She liked the idea and we received her consent to use her actual voice in the space,"" added Ms Schoeder. The students also consulted sexual assault experts to make sure the experience would be ""thoughtful and informative"".  Stanford Law School professor Michele Dauber, who led the successful drive to recall Judge Aaron Persky, had also been involved in the creation of the garden.  She said the first priority had been safety, describing the dimly-lit area as a ""rape trap"". But she said that after preventing an attack happening there again, the next goal was to ""acknowledge the harm"".  Stanford had agreed to a plaque, if the words were taken from the victim impact statement. Ms Miller's first and second choices of wording were rejected by the university. They offered their own suggestions but Ms Miller did not feel they were appropriate.  One suggestion was ""I'm right here, I'm okay, everything's okay, I'm right here"" - words Ms Miller spoke to her sister after the assault - but the next paragraph explains what Ms Miller was keeping hidden, and that she was not at all OK.  'Survivors are in this together' Professor Dauber said: ""This young woman has been damaged enough. This was literally the least Stanford could do.  ""With Chanel's book coming out, I think an appropriate reaction by Stanford would be to rethink their decision about the plaque and put it up as they promised. They broke a promise to someone who has been severely harmed.""  Student Sabrina Medler is a sexual assault survivor in her final year at Stanford who wrote about her own experiences this week, saying  reading Chanel Miller's victim impact statement had empowered her .  Ms Medler said she often visits the garden and has felt ""peace"" there. She said: ""Survivors have reacted to it differently. I've always found the space comforting. When I'm there I feel a connection to Chanel Miller. It makes me feel like survivors are in this together.""   But she acknowledged it was also felt to be a reminder of the aftermath of the case, adding that Stanford had failed to do justice to Ms Miller.  She has now organised a campus petition asking for Stanford to publicly apologise for not installing a plaque with the words Ms Miller had chosen. image copyright Getty Images A Stanford University spokesman said: ""After creating the garden, we worked very hard to get agreement on a physical quote for the space, and we regret that wasn't achievable.  ""The university wanted to ensure the space would provide a supportive environment for all survivors, not all of whom may have reached the same point of post-traumatic healing, and who might have a range of emotional reactions.  ""We welcome this student-led initiative that offers the use of augmented reality in the space and provides visitors the agency to engage with the garden and its purpose.""   The university also said a  statement made by Provost Persis Drell  in March 2018 still stood, where she explained Stanford's decision. In it, she says it was felt Ms Miller's words ""expressed sentiments that would not be supportive in a healing space"".  She added that the sexual assault had ""changed our community forever"" and that Stanford was working to ""create and nurture a culture where similar events do not happen in future"".

A jury was told Gabrielle Friel knew of Elliot Rodger and the acts of violence he carried out, had sourced weapons and was planning an attack. But in his closing speech, defence solicitor advocate Brian Gilfedder argued Mr Friel should be acquitted. Mr Friel, 22, denies intending to commit acts of terrorism. At the High Court in Edinburgh, Richard Goddard QC reminded jurors of Mr Friel's words to a social worker on 14 August last year when he said: ""I feel like I am Elliot Rodger who was a killer in a school."" 'Mass shooting' Mr Goddard said Sarah Drummond had noted he was very fixated and almost idolised  Californian spree killer Rodger . The advocate depute said that two days later Mr Friel told psychiatrist Dr Alexander Quinn: ""I do want to carry out a mass shooting."" He said: ""We know when he spoke all those words he had already ordered and taken possession of a crossbow with telescopic sights."" Mr Goddard told the jury: ""We know Gabrielle Friel had embraced incel ideology, fixated on it."" The prosecutor said there was ""a host of incriminating circumstances"" which amounted to a convincing case against Mr Friel and called on a jury to convict him of two offences under the Terrorism Act which he faces. Mr Goddard said the social worker reported Mr Friel as feeling a lot of anger and being unfairly treated in life. She said he felt rejected and jealous of what others had and felt females were not interested in him. Mr Goddard said jurors might think all of these were incel-related themes. Crossbow and machete Mr Friel had told her he felt like Rodger and was able to tell her about his YouTube video and manifesto. The prosecutor said that Dr Quinn, who saw Mr Friel two days after his meeting with the social worker, said he was very angry with the world and was displaying anger towards women. He felt girls and women had never been interested in him. He said to the psychiatrist: ""If I do plan an attack it will be real. I do want to cause a mass shooting."" Mr Goddard said Mr Friel had already sourced a high-powered crossbow and a foot-long machete and was looking for the means to carry them into a public place. The prosecutor said he had also made ""visit after visit after visit"" to online retailers of firearms. 'Provoke the police' Mr Friel, from Edinburgh, is accused of possessing a crossbow, scope, 15 bolts, a machete and a ballistic vest between 1 June and 16 August last year in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that it was for a purpose connected with ""the commission, preparation or instigation of an act of terrorism"" in Edinburgh. He is also accused of, with the intention of committing acts of terrorism, conducting online research in an attempt to acquire a firearm, in relation of spree killing mass murder and  expressing a desire to commit such a murder. He denies the charges. Defence solicitor advocate Brian Gilfedder argued that Mr Friel should be cleared of the charges he faces. He said: ""This case has nothing to do with terrorism, nothing to do with advancing an ideology, an incel-related ideology. ""My submission is this case is all about the accused wanting to achieve death by extended suicide - to provoke the police to shoot him. That was his purpose, that was his intention."" Mr Gilfedder argued that one of the three key factors for a terrorism conviction was that it was committed for the purpose of of advancing a political, racial, religious or ideological cause. He said with Mr Friel the alleged basis was that of the incel ideology but maintained that Crown ""fell down"" on that factor. The jury will return to consider its deliberations on Tuesday.

By Phil Mercer BBC News, Sydney Published 25 January 2012 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Three attacks in as many weeks have put sharks back on to Australia's front pages. Mercifully, the victims survived - but three maulings is about as many as this country would often see in an entire year.     Off a remote beach in Western Australia, a snorkelling guide was injured by a 10-foot (3m) tiger shark, while two surfers were savaged in separate attacks on the continent's heavily populated east coast.  Graham Nickisson, a member of the Westpac Rescue Helicopter aircrew, was dispatched to find the ""rogue shark"" - possibly a bull or juvenile great white - responsible for ripping off part of a board rider's thigh at Redhead Beach, near Newcastle, north of Sydney.   What he witnessed from the sky that day over the glittering New South Wales coast was staggering. Never before during a career spanning three decades had he seen the ocean rippling with so many sharks. ""This was quite extraordinary to actually see them so close to shore on our city beaches. I've never seen it in all my years.  It was frightening particularly being so close to swimmers. They were certainly unaware the sharks were there,"" he says. From the air, some appeared to be up to 4m long including one of nature's most menacing creatures, the hammerhead. ""We came across a lone surfboard rider and when we had a closer look we spotted a shark in the vicinity of him.  ""We thankfully got him out of the water as the shark was getting closer and closer, to within about 20ft (6m) of him. We were concerned that we were about to witness a disaster but it all turned out well."" An abundance of baitfish, due to cleaner water and more nutrients in the ocean, is one reason why sharks could be attracted in greater numbers to the coast.  Swimmers and surfers are almost certainly accidental victims but while attacks off Australia are uncommon - figures of 20 in 2009 and 14 in 2010 were higher than normal - deaths are rare.  On average there's one fatality each year, yet news of close encounters invariably prompts Australians to wonder what is lurking out to sea.        Rodney Fox, who was almost killed by a great white shark 40 years ago, believes society is gripped by an ""irrational fear"" of these shadowy prowlers, many of which are protected in Australian waters. ""I've spent my whole life trying to get people to understand that sharks just aren't as bad as people make out,"" he says from the deck of his boat in South Australia. He still bears the scars of a spectacular brush with death. His wounds required 468 stitches. image caption From left: Conservationist Rodney Fox in his youth, after a shark attack, and today ""This huge thump and crash hit me in the chest,"" says the 71-year-old conservationist and filmmaker.  ""I stuck my fingers in its eyes and it let go. I pushed it off and grabbed the whole shark in a bear hug so it couldn't bite me and as I was holding on, I realised I was going to drown because I was 10 metres under water.""   He got to the surface but the shark followed him and swallowed his fish float, which was still attached to him, dragging him under again. Fortunately, the line snapped and he kicked for the surface, where he was rescued by the crew onboard a passing boat that had seen the sea turn red. Australia has a huge coastline that stretches almost 50,000 kilometres and is punctuated by over 10,000 beaches, more than any other nation on Earth. The vast majority of the population - about 85% - live within 50km of the sea. It's not so much blood but salt water that courses through their veins.  More people than ever are taking to the ocean to surf, swim and sail but the chances of coming face-to-face with jaws full of flesh-tearing teeth are slim.  ""There are a small number of attacks each year,"" says Dermot O'Gorman, the head of conservation group WWF-Australia. ""It's much more high-risk to drive your car than to go swimming on an Australian beach."" A shark alert was issued at Manly beach in Sydney earlier this month but on an overcast summer's day, surfer Nick, a 22-year-old finance worker from Queensland, was eager to take to the battleship grey waters in search of a decent wave. image caption Sydney's Manly beach recently issued a shark alert ""You try not to think about sharks but occasionally you see a shadow in the water,"" he says.  ""You see them quickly but they swim away. It's obviously a bit frightening and you lift your legs up off the board but if you're out with other surfers you take your chances. You're out there just to surf, not to worry about sharks."" His 23-year-old friend Phil agrees.  ""There's obviously a threat out there but attacks don't happen that often.

Brad Smith was making a keynote speech at the CES technology trade show. Earlier, it emerged President-elect Joe Biden had created a new post for a former National Security Agency official to help determine the US response to the attack. Anne Neuberger had specialised in operations against Russia. Pre-emptive strike Plans to appoint her to the role of deputy national security adviser for cyber-security within the National Security Council  were first reported by Politico  and have now been  confirmed by the New York Times . The NYT said she had run the NSA's Russia Small Group, responsible for a pre-emptive strike on Kremlin operatives in 2018.  She is currently head of the agency's Cybersecurity Directorate. US intelligence agencies believe Russia was behind the SolarWinds attack, which compromised email accounts at the US Department of Justice as well as giving the perpetrators access to the systems of government agencies, businesses and other organisations worldwide. The full extent of the attack has yet to emerge.  The Kremlin has denied involvement. 'Mass assault' SolarWinds sells a widely used network monitoring tool that was altered to provide the hackers with a backdoor. Microsoft was among the victims and has confirmed some of its source code - the normally inaccessible instructions behind its software - had been accessed. ""Governments have spied on each other for centuries, it would be naive to think or even ask them to stop,"" said Mr Smith in his keynote. ""But we've long lived in a world where there were norms and rules that created expectations about what was appropriate and what was not.  ""And what happened with SolarWinds was not. ""Why? Because this wasn't a case of one nation simply trying to spy on or hack its way into a computer network of another. ""It was a mass indiscriminate global assault on the technology supply chain that all of us are responsible for protecting. ""It is a danger that the world cannot afford."" Covid crisis Security experts needed to learn one of the lessons of the 11 September 2001 terror attacks, which had exposed how different US government agencies had failed to share threat information, Mr Smith said. ""We need to move, as the 9/11 Commission said, from a culture where people only gave others information when they had a need to know,"" he said. ""And in the words of that commission, change the culture so that people feel a need to share."" Mr Smith also said there was a greater need to work together to tackle attacks linked to the Covid crisis. ""We have lived through the biggest pandemic in a century,"" he said. ""And what did some people use that pandemic to do?  ""To launch cyber-attacks against hospitals, against the public health sector, against the World Health Organization, against the first line of critical responders. ""This too should be off limits."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Ms Neuberger led efforts to protect the US's 2018 mid-term elections Ms Neuberger will now be responsible for trying to persuade US agencies and the country's wider cyber-security sector to work together against such threats. In her previous role, she coordinated the response of US government agencies to a flaw her team discovered suspected Russian hackers were using. ""It was really great to see five different cyber-security entities using that to identify other Russian intelligence infrastructure and then take that down,""  she told CBS News in August . Last month, Mr Biden said once the extent of the damage the SolarWinds hack had caused was better known, the US would probably ""respond in kind"". There will be many in the cyber-security industry who nodded along enthusiastically with Brad Smith. The SolarWinds hack has stunned and terrified the sector - particularly those who make and sell software to protect us from hacks. The last few weeks have been a nightmare scenario playing out in slow motion as more and more details of the scope and depth of the intrusion have been drip-fed to the public. For the intelligence community though, at least in private, it's more of a case of: ""Why didn't we think of that?"" All nations hack each other and supply chain attacks like this  -albeit not as successful - have been used in the past for spying or disruption. Clearly the Biden administration is preparing to respond in some way. But in truth, aside from perhaps a public naming and shaming of the hackers, there is little it can do directly to the perpetrators involved. What happens behind closed doors is far more significant as cyber-defences will need to be rebuilt and potential offensive retaliation planned.

Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called it a ""repulsive terror attack"" and said one gunman was also killed. Police were searching for at least one attacker who was still at large, the interior minister said. The shootings took place near Vienna's central synagogue but it is not yet clear if that was the target. The city's police chief said two men and a woman were killed. At least a dozen other people were wounded, officials said. In pictures: Scene of gun attack The attack happened just hours before Austria imposed new national restrictions to try to stem rising cases of coronavirus. Many people were out enjoying bars and restaurants which are now closed until the end of November. European leaders strongly condemned the shooting. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""deeply shocked by the terrible attacks"". What do we know about the attack? Police said the incident began at about 20:00 (19:00 GMT) on Monday, near the Seitenstettengasse synagogue, when a heavily armed man opened fire on people outside cafes and restaurants. Members of the special forces quickly arrived at the scene. One policeman suffered a gunshot wound before other officers shot the perpetrator, who was armed with an automatic rifle, a pistol and a machete.  Jewish community leader Oskar Deutsch tweeted that the synagogue was closed at the time the attack began. image copyright Reuters image caption Police sealed off streets near Schwedenplatz in Vienna An officer guarding the synagogue was among the wounded, newspaper Kronen Zeitung reported. It was not immediately clear how many attackers took part in the shooting. Austrian media said one person had been arrested, citing the interior ministry. Footage posted on social media showed people running through the streets as gunshots rang out.  Witness Chris Zhao was in a nearby restaurant when the shooting started. He told the BBC: ""We heard noises that sounded like firecrackers. We heard about 20 to 30 and we thought that to be actually gunfire. We saw the ambulances... lining up. There were victims. Sadly, we also saw a body lying down the street next to us."" image copyright Reuters image caption The shooting began at about 20:00 local time As a major anti-terror operation swung into action, police urged people to avoid the area and not to use public transport. Roadblocks were set up around the city centre.  Police in the neighbouring Czech Republic said they were carrying out random checks on the border with Austria amid fears that the gunman might head in that direction. Interior Minister Karl Nehammer said the attacker still at large was ""heavily armed and dangerous"". He told a news conference that children in Vienna would not be expected to attend school on Tuesday. What has the reaction been? On Twitter, Mr Kurz said ""we are experiencing difficult hours in our republic"", adding that the army would take over the security of major buildings in Vienna. ""Our police will act decisively against the perpetrators of this hideous terrorist attack. We will never allow ourselves to be intimidated by terrorism,"" he said. image copyright Reuters image caption This man raised his hands as police checked his identity during their search for the gunmen image copyright Reuters image caption A number of people have been taken to hospital, including some with serious injuries Austria had until now been spared the sort of attacks that have hit other European countries. Leaders across the region condemned the shooting, with French President Emmanuel Macron saying that Europe must not ""give up"" in the face of attacks. ""We the French people share the shock and grief of the Austrian people, struck this evening by an attack in the heart of their capital, Vienna. After France, a friend of ours is attacked. This is our Europe. Our enemies must know who they are dealing with,"" he said. Three people died in a knife attack in a church in the French city of Nice  last week in what Mr Macron said was an ""Islamist terrorist attack"". The UK prime minister also said the country's ""thoughts are with the people of Austria - we stand united with you against terror"" while Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we stand ready to support in any way we can"". European Council President Charles Michel called it a cowardly act that violated life and human values. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte called the shooting ""a heinous act"" and expressed ""solidarity"" with Austria.

Prof Olusoga says statues, such as those of slave traders, are not useful ways of teaching history or explaining the values of previous eras. Instead the historian argues they are a continuing public ""validation"" of people who did ""terrible things"". Prof Olusoga is to be an online school teacher himself this week. Pupils in the lockdown will be able to watch Prof Olusoga explaining the importance of the census to historians - ahead of the national census in March - and looking at how it can reveal changes of populations and hidden stories. At school with Gazza The University of Manchester professor recently revealed one of his own hidden histories - that he had been at primary school in Gateshead with Paul Gascoigne and the former footballer had rescued Prof Olusoga and his sister from racist bullying. Barack Obama speaks to David Olusoga Marcus Rashford faces racism on social media Edward Colston statue pushed into harbour Statues get protection from 'baying mobs' The TV presenter, who had been born in Nigeria but moved to a council estate in north- east England, says the prejudice he faced in school was part of the ""Darwinian world of the 1970s playground"". image copyright EPA image caption Marcus Rashford faces the social media version of the prejudice of 1970s playgrounds, says the historian But the historian still sees its continuation in the abuse aimed at  black footballers such as Marcus Rashford . ""Racism in football just found a new outlet in the world of social media. If you look under that rock, it's there all the time. ""Marcus, because he so high profile and because we love to attack people who are doing good in this country, for reasons I've never quite understood, is the focus at the moment. But it's constant, it's always there,"" says the historian and author. His lesson about the census, made with the Office for National Statistics, is about the ""lascars"", sailors recruited from Asia to work on British ships, who often faced tough conditions for lower pay than their white counterparts. They were at the centre of a trading empire that was ""incredibly complicated, diverse and also unfair"". Facing up to slavery He says studying the British empire, in its strengths and weaknesses, is ""absolutely critical"" to understanding present-day Britain - in terms of the ""economy, culture, cuisine, as well the people who are living here"". But when it comes to issues such as examining links with the slave trade, he says there is a reluctance and a push towards ""distraction and deflection"" and ""various ways of saying 'We don't want to talk about that'."" image caption David Olusoga won a Bafta award for his programme Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners He argues that debates about statues - such as the statue to slave trader Edward Colston that was pushed into the harbour in Bristol - should face up to the historical evidence of who is being commemorated. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick recently promised more safeguards to monuments, saying they are ""almost always best explained and contextualised,  not taken and hidden away "". ""What has stood for generations should be considered thoughtfully, not removed on a whim or at the behest of a baying mob,"" said Mr Jenrick. Prof Olusoga says there has been particular hostility to suggestions there were enslaved black people in 18th Century Britain, as well as in the colonies. This seems to make people deeply ""uncomfortable"", says the presenter of the A House Through Time TV series. ""I think that's because we've created a moral firewall between what happened in Britain and what happened in the empire - with the idea that what happened in the empire doesn't really count."" Missing history Prof Olusoga also has concerns for future historians - and digital gaps in the historical record. He says the way politicians and decision-makers use messaging services like WhatsApp to share their private thoughts could leave future historians with much less understanding about how policies are being made. Historians should be ""enormously worried"" about ""politicians finding ways of not leaving records of their decisions in their debates"", says Prof Olusoga.  ""That's fundamental to the workings of democracy."" He says written memos, notes, letters and emails have been ways into the thinking of politicians behind the scenes, that will not be available for an era of private, unrecorded messages. ""One of the most interesting things, if you study Churchill, is his notes in the margin,"" he says. ""I think politicians need to leave a record of their deliberations and their debates that lead them to the decisions they made - so they can be held accountable by historians.""

Published 7 July 2011 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption The majority of grizzly attacks occur when a female feels her cubs are threatened An American man has been killed by a grizzly bear while he and his wife were taking a hike in the famed Yellowstone National Park. Bear attacks are often fatal - so what can you do to protect yourself? The couple were said to have surprised the bear while she was with her cubs. The woman - who ran before dropping to the ground - survived the attack after the bear picked her up by her backpack, but then left her alone. While it is not an exact science, most experts say that, in the case of a bear acting in defence, the best response is to either back away slowly, or lie down on the ground and play dead. Nearly all say prevention is better than cure - the best advice may be to give bears a wide berth. If you are not familiar with the area, ask locals where bears are most commonly found, and plan your route accordingly, advises Ted Oakes, producer of the BBC's The Bear Family and Me. ""It's really important to not surprise them,"" Mr Oakes says, so attach bells to your hiking gear and make noise so the animals know you are there.  If you are camping, keep food away from the tents, as bears are omnivores and will scavenge for whatever is available. He recommends putting edible goods in a sealable bag and hanging them on a tree about 100 yards fom the campsite. Hikers can also find safety in numbers, he says. Grizzly bears - a subspecies of the brown bear - can weigh up to 1,500 pounds (680kg) and can run at up to 35mph (55 km/h), according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service. They do not attack humans regularly, and will tend to only do so if they are defending their young and are startled, or if hunters surprise them when they are feeding on a carcass. If you do come across one, then walk away slowly, and avoid the temptation to run, Mr Oakes says. Dr Lynn Rogers, founder of the North American Bear Center, offers slightly different advice.  If a bear is with cubs then it is a good idea to play dead and clasp your hands around your head at the back of the neck, he says. The aim is to be as non-threatening as possible. He says that grizzlies - in contrast to black bears - evolved in more open landscapes and therefore developed more aggressive tendencies.  ""With a black bear, it doesn't make much difference [how you respond]. They're not out to get you. It's one in a million that wants to kill you,"" he says. While fear of an attack should not mar enjoyment of the beautiful scenery, it is worth being prepared, such as by carrying pepper spray, Dr Rogers says. ""Pepper spray is easier to carry and much easier to aim than a gun,"" he argues. And Mr Oakes agrees that such attacks are very rare so it's not worth letting it spoil your trip. ""Driving to the park leads to more fatalities than bear attacks."" The latest incident was the first such killing in the park in nearly 25 years, according to officials at Yellowstone.

The frenzied journalism that followed the 2014 abduction by militant Islamist group Boko Haram of more than 200 girls from their school in Chibok, north-east Nigeria, may have been well-meaning but it led to some unfortunate outcomes.  Prior to the Chibok incident, Boko Haram leader Abubakar Shekau was just a fringe figure that Nigerians saw on TV once in a while.  When he stabbed at the camera with his fingers and guffawed wildly while threatening everyone from Nigeria's then-President Goodluck Jonathan to the US president at the time, Barack Obama, with death and destruction, many of us wondered: Who did this unkempt man really think he was?  But, in the aftermath of Chibok media organisations around the world broadcast and rebroadcast Shekau's slightest remark.  And he kept them supplied with material, such as videos of the kidnapped schoolgirls whom he promised to sell.  image copyright AFP image caption Some of the Chibok victims met President Muhammadu Buhari after they were freed in 2017 Those who were abducted have subsequently described how the militants who held them captive revelled in any news about the incident. The Chibok coverage inflated Shekau's value as a media commodity, making it increasingly rewarding to keep him on the airwaves.  It also distorted the story itself.  Despite the way it was covered by the international media, the Chibok kidnappings had nothing to do with ""an attack on girls' education"", rather it was banditry gone wrong.  When they were released after more than two years in Boko Haram captivity, some of those held described how the militants who attacked their school were simply on a mission to loot and steal.  'Militants build a global brand' After emptying out the school's storeroom of food, they were then left with the problem of what to do with the students and began arguing.  One suggested that that they lock the girls in a dormitory and set them on fire. Another suggested that they use the girls to gain access to their parents' homes nearby and then steal some more food.  Eventually, one man came up with the idea that would lead to infamy: ""Let us take them to Shekau. He will know what to do.""  image copyright The Office of First Lady image caption The Chibok kidnapping sparked a global social media campaign that included then-US First Lady Michelle Obama This same account was recorded in a report by New York-based group Human Rights Watch  based on interviews with some of the 57 students who managed to escape on the night of the kidnapping by jumping off the trucks used to ferry them away.  Although published a few months after the incident, little attention was paid to that detail.  Determined to make the Boko Haram attacks about the irresistible theme of terrorists targeting female education, some media outlets ignored any thread that did not fit this narrative.  Just a few weeks before the Chibok incident, Boko Haram had attacked a school in the north-east town of Burni Yadi and allowed female students to flee before slaughtering 40 boys in their dormitory.  The Burni Yadi incident attracted little media attention until after the Chibok kidnappings, but this additional knowledge did nothing to sway the direction of reporting.  In many cases the media insisted on viewing the Chibok incident through the lens of gender violence, unwittingly providing Boko Haram with the guidance they needed to build their global brand.   Boko Haram's use of women as suicide bombers skyrocketed after the Chibok kidnappings,  according to a 2017 report by Combating Terrorism Center  at West Point and Yale University, suggesting that the group adopted the tactic to grab headlines and elicit shock and awe.  It soon became the first terror group in history to use more female suicide bombers than male, sending at least 80 women to their deaths in 2017 alone.  ""Through the global response to the Chibok abductions, the insurgents learned the potent symbolic value of young female bodies... that using them as bombers would attract attention,"" said Hilary Matfess, co-author of the report.  'Celebrity monster' In February 2018, another 110 girls were kidnapped by Boko Haram from their school in the north-east town of Dapchi.   In the past few years, the government of President Muhammadu Buhari has severely curtailed Boko Haram's impact in north-east Nigeria.  Its attacks are much fewer, their hold on international headlines lasting for hours rather than what used to be days or months. But another security crisis has risen elsewhere.  Gunmen, popularly referred to by government officials and local media as ""bandits"", have been terrorising north-west Nigeria with robberies and kidnappings.  Politicians, entrepreneurs, commuters and even schoolchildren have been kidnapped at various times and released after a ransom was paid, although not on the scale seen in December when more than  300 boys were abducted from their boarding school  on the outskirts of Kankara town last month.  media caption Abdulhadi Abubaka described to the BBC last month how he managed to escape the mass kidnapping at his school near Kankara Nigerian security agents and officials of the Kankara community stated that the boys were taken by bandits. But when the international media swooped in and amplified the apparent link to the Chibok incident of more than six years before, Shekau must have seen an opportunity.  A whole three days after the Kankara kidnapping, Boko Haram said it was behind the attack. And, once again, many international outlets presented their platforms for this celebrity monster to dance and display. And, in the process, ran wild with a faulty narrative, ignoring all evidence to the contrary. 'Shekau's megalomaniac commentary' The numerous headlines that unquestioningly attributed the Kankara kidnappings to Boko Haram failed to consider by what miracle the group had expanded from its decimated operations in the north-east to the north-west, two regions that are vast and separate.  Not even in its prime did Boko Haram brazenly operate in the north-west.  The most the militants achieved was a few, albeit deadly, suicide bomb attacks.  In a similar manner by which he fanned his popularity in 2014, Shekau fed the media with megalomaniac commentary and a video allegedly of the Kankara boys.        Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani The voices of the parents were drowned in the sea of global media coverage, which appeared unbending in the determination to connect this incident with Chibok"" Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani Novelist and journalist Local media, while worried about the increasing insecurity in Nigeria, was more sceptical about the Boko Haram angle.  When Nigeria's Cable newspaper took the time to show the video to some of the parents, many of whom do not have internet facilities and so had to rely on secondary sources to view it, they described the recording as fake.  ""Why are they playing tricks on us?"" the parents asked. ""This video is not genuine. It does not show our children.""  Nevertheless, the voices of the parents were drowned in the sea of global media coverage, which appeared unbending in the determination to connect this incident with Chibok.  image copyright Reuters image caption Students left their footwear behind in the scramble that followed the attack in Kankara Some international security experts suggested that while direct Boko Haram involvement seems to have been discounted, Boko Haram training, help and encouragement were involved.  Many Nigerians believe that Boko Haram took interest only after the international media covered the story. The government insisted no ransom was paid to the kidnappers, who it continued to describe as ""bandits"". Media coverage of such heinous acts is important: governments need to be encouraged to act, victims need to be remembered and memorialised and the public needs to be warned.  But all this can be done without inspiring more criminals and without providing them tutorials.

Hailed as a hero by his supporters, Sunday ""Igboho"" Adeyemo is seen as a dangerous rabble rouser by his opponents, accused of inciting ethnic hatred and killing. Once only well-known in his part of south-western Nigeria, he has now become one of the most talked about - and divisive - figures across the country. Through a series of inflammatory statements, Mr Adeyemo has been thrust into the heart of one of Nigeria's most deadly ethnic divides - the conflict between Fulani herders and other groups, over access to land and grazing rights. Lionised in a feature film Last month after the killing of a politician, Mr Adeyemo felt he had seen enough and captured attention with his demand that the Fulani herders, from northern Nigeria, leave the south-west, seen as the home of the Yoruba ethnic group, for all their alleged crimes. But this self-styled defender of the defenceless, popularly known as Igboho - after his hometown in south-west Oyo state - is no stranger to controversy and deadly conflict.  The 48-year-old has been lionised locally for his role, in the late 1990s, in age-old intra-Yoruba communal battles. His reputed exploits were acted out in a feature film that was a fantastical display of magic charms and juju. In one scene where rival gangs face off, the actor playing Mr Adeyemo arrives on a motorcycle, picks up a poisoned banana and calmly eats half of it without feeling any ill effects. He then plucks a machine gun out of thin air and fires at his opponents who flee in every direction. That film and other tales about him, such as that he walks around with a snake around his neck, have contributed to a local reputation of invincibility.  Who is Sunday Adeyemo? Born in 1972 in Igboho, Oyo state Runs a dealership selling new and second-hand cars Was a motorcycle mechanic in his early years Has a foundation named after him that caters to the needy It is not clear how he came into the car business that he operates out of the city of Ibadan but he seems to have made a success of it, selling everything from new Rolls Royces to second-hand Toyotas. His clientele include powerful politicians and governors and he is often seen with them in public. Mr Adeyemo achieved some national notoriety last October when he used the country's independence day to call for the creation of an independent Yoruba republic, although he was widely ridiculed for the idea. Now, though, as he has become a lightning rod for local grievances he is being taken more seriously. Land rights are at the core of those grievances. image copyright Getty Images image caption Climate change is pushing Fulani pastoralists to go further south to graze their cattle Fulani herders and their families walk for hundreds of kilometres from the extreme north to central Nigeria and beyond at least twice a year to find the best grazing land for their cattle. But this has often led to friction with local communities, who accuse their cattle of trampling on their crops, and sometimes accuse the herders of robbery and other crimes. Africa Daily podcast - Why are farmers and herders fighting in Nigeria? Some of the herders are also employed by rich southerners who own the cattle but employ Fulani to look after them. A federal government plan approved in 2019 to  solve the problem by creating ranches for the herdsmen  was rejected by most southern governors who accused President Muhammadu Buhari, a Fulani, of hatching a plot to grab land for his people. In the past few years, clashes have become more deadly as both the Fulani and those opposed to them have set up armed self-defence militias.  In the south-west, state governors established a regional security outfit, Amotekun, to help deal with the problems.  The 'leopard unit', vigilantes and Nigeria's kidnap crisis Open grazing has also been banned in all six south-western states. Tensions were ignited in December after the killing of politician Fatai Aborode, in Oyo state. Mr Adeyemo decided to take matters into his own hands and told the Fulanis to go, without providing any evidence of their involvement in that killing or other alleged crimes. After his seven-day ultimatum expired in January, he held a rally in the area where the killing took place, after which the homes of some more settled Fulani, who had been part of the community for generations, were burned. 'I shiver when I hear his name' Abdulkadri Saliu, the leader of the Fulanis in the area, whose house was torched and who has now fled, accused Mr Adeyemo of instigating the trouble. ""At the mention of Igboho's name I get scared and shiver,"" he said, adding he had never seen violence like it. He also alleged that his younger brother was killed. image caption Abdulkadri Saliu accuses Mr Adeyemo of instigating the villagers to destroy his property, which he denies Mr Adeyemo denied responsibility for the trouble, saying that the police had been with him all through the time he was in the area. But he also travelled to Yewa in Ogun state to ""evict"" Fulani herders. There, he was received by a joyous crowd and whipped them up by saying that ""killer herdsmen"" had escaped justice ""because the herdsmen are close to the federal government"". ""Any Fulani herdsman who engages in kidnapping should be flushed out,"" he added. Police say they are investigating both incidents but will not say if he is a suspect.

Facebook, fake news and Fulani killings The motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria The day the pirates came His actions have been widely condemned, especially by groups in northern Nigeria who accuse him of inciting ethnic violence and engaging in the ""unlawful eviction"" of citizens. Some political leaders in the south-west have joined in the criticism but there has also been massive support for him in the region.  Federal lawmaker Shina Peller wrote a message on Instagram saluting Mr Adeyemo's ""courage, bravery, and participation in this struggle"".                  View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Shina Peller (@shinapeller) A GoFundMe account to raise money for his cause received more than 10m naira (Â£19,000; $26,000)  in less than 24 hours. 'Nigerians can live where they want' Mr Adeyemo's sympathisers accuse the federal government of not doing enough to stop the attacks on local communities by herdsmen. Benue Governor Samuel Ortom, whose state was until recently the epicentre of deadly clashes between the herders and farmers, believes that the crisis has been enabled by the leniency of the president towards the Fulani herders. Information Minister Lai Mohammed said he would not be drawn into a reaction on the governor's comments, telling the BBC that ""Nigerians have a right to live in all parts of the country"".  Nobel literature laureate Wole Soyinka, who is from the south-west, also criticised Mr Buhari's silence on the activities of herders, saying it could develop into a civil war. media caption Wole Soyinka: The war is on our doorstep ""What do they expect of us now that the war is on our doorstep? Of course there will be mobilisation and if we keep waiting for this to be centrally handled, we are all going to become, if we're not already, slaves in our land,"" he told the BBC. Soyinka said Mr Adeyemo had responded to the situation in the way he knew how. Attempts are being made to quell the tensions and even Mr Adeyemo has said he is open to talks with the government. But some are now describing him as the saviour who rode up in a shiny car and rescued his people from the cattle herders.  For someone who has compared himself to Biblical figures, it is a label he will bask in.

This is the latest high-profile Twitter security breach after similar attacks in July on US presidential hopeful Joe Biden and Tesla founder Elon Musk.

But only a ""small subset"" of those 130 accounts had control seized by the attacker. The security breach saw accounts including those of Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West and Bill Gates tweet a Bitcoin scam to millions of followers. The FBI was called in to investigate. The apparent scam spread to mainstream celebrity accounts such as Kim Kardashian West and those of corporations Apple and Uber. Attackers were able to bypass the accounts' security because they had gained access to Twitter's own internal administration tools. Twitter said: ""Since the attack, we've significantly limited access to our internal tools and systems to ensure ongoing account security while we complete our investigation."" Despite it being obvious to many that it was a scam, the hackers received hundreds of transfers, worth more than $100,000 (Â£75,000).

The new HQ - a northern counterpart to Conservative Campaign Headquarters in London -  is expected to open next year, Amanda Milling said, as she opened the party's virtual conference.  Some MPs have urged the PM to set out a broad post-Brexit vision for the party. It comes as Boris Johnson has promised low-deposit mortgages to help young people get onto the housing ladder. In an interview with  the Daily Telegraph  ahead of his party's four-day conference, the prime minister said he had asked ministers to work up plans for encouraging long-term fixed-rate mortgages with 5% deposits. ""We need mortgages that will help people really get on the housing ladder even if they have only a very small amount to pay by way of deposit, the 95% mortgages,"" he said. ""I think it could be absolutely revolutionary, particularly for young people."" Worried Tories pining for the 'Old Boris' Everybody got 'complacent' over virus, suggests PM The Conservative Campaign Headquarters, in Westminster, London, is where general election campaigns are run.  It was known for many years as Conservative Central Office. According to BBC political correspondent Iain Watson, it houses press officers who undertake the more political tasks which civil servants cannot do - including attacking opponents and rebutting opponents' attacks.  It also liaises with the ""voluntary party"" - the grassroots foot soldiers - and raises funds for national campaigning. The Conservatives argue that the new Leeds headquarters will reinforce their commitment to deliver for those in northern constituencies who voted for the party for the first time at the general election in December.  ""This new headquarters will provide the party with a base at the heart of the blue wall,"" Ms Milling said. Also speaking at the conference, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the government wanted to move more Civil Service jobs outside of London.  ""Far too many government jobs tend to be in the Westminster and Whitehall village,"" he said. ""We have an amazing Civil Service and it has drawn its resources and people from lots of different communities - I think we now need to give back to those communities as well."" Meanwhile, Downing Street has set out the details of an  independent review of transport connections across the UK .  The review, led by Network Rail chairman Sir Peter Hendy, will look at improving road and rail networks and will also examine the ""cost, practicality and demand"" of building a bridge or tunnel between Northern Ireland and Scotland. The transport study will set out advice on a ""wide range of possible options"" to improve the quality and availability of links across the UK, Downing Street said.

There will be a lot of talk about ""levelling up"" - in other words, doing more to spread investment and opportunity beyond London and the South East. But some recently-elected Conservative MPs believe the term is vague and not easily understood by voters. One of the 2019 intake told our correspondent: ""We need to put flesh on the bones of this agenda - it has be about more than a couple of shiny new rail stations."" Another said the prime minister had to ""raise his sights"" and provide a longer-term vision, amid concerns over narrowing polls.  'Domestic agenda' Mr Johnson told the Telegraph that he was determined to press ahead with a ""massive domestic agenda"" and deliver on Conservative manifesto promises, despite the ongoing coronavirus crisis.  The prime minister has promised to create ""Generation Buy"" with low-deposit mortgages to help get young people onto the housing ladder. He has also insisted he remains a low-tax, libertarian Conservative who will pay for the cost of the pandemic through a ""free market-led recovery"".

The government's spending plans to meet hospital pledge Analysis by Alice Aitken, BBC Reality Check You may remember that the Conservatives  pledged to build 40 new hospitals  in their 2019 election manifesto.  On the eve of the party conference, the prime minister confirmed Â£3.7bn in funding for the project - an increase on the Â£2.8bn previously announced. Six Hospital Trusts had already been promised Â£2.7bn in funding while 21 others were given a share of Â£100m in seed funding to develop proposals. On Friday those Trusts were told they will all be fully-funded to deliver 25 new hospitals. A new hospital at Shotley Bridge in Durham has been added to the list and the government is also inviting bids for a further eight schemes.

The training, intended to tackle patterns of discrimination and prejudice, is used in many workplaces. The government says there is no evidence it changes attitudes - and is urging other public sector employers to end this type of training. But race equality campaigner Halima Begum said the government ""mustn't backtrack on anti-racism training"". Discrimination Lucille Thirlby, assistant general secretary of the FDA civil servants' union, called on ministers to say ""what are you going to replace it with"". ""How will they ensure people are not discriminated against? It's easier to attack something than do something positive about it,"" she said. Prince Harry warns of unconscious bias MPs refuse to take unconscious bias training Implicit bias: Is everyone racist? Unconscious bias training is an attempt to challenge prejudiced ways of thinking that could unfairly influence decisions - such as who might get a job or a promotion. It can be prejudiced behaviour, based on assumptions about others, that people are not aware of themselves. But the government says there is no proof that such training changes behaviour - and that it can ""backfire"" and create a negative response. A written ministerial statement from Cabinet Office minister Julia Lopez will announce ""unconscious bias training does not achieve its intended aims. It will therefore be phased out in the civil service"". ""We encourage other public sector employers to do likewise,"" she says, urging the end to training which has been widely used to address bias in race, gender and sexuality. But it has also been caught up in ""culture war"" arguments and accusations over ""political correctness"". 'No evidence' The government says it is ""determined to eliminate discrimination in the workplace"", but unconscious bias training is the wrong approach. The Government Equalities Office says there has been ""no evidence"" that the training improved workplace equality. Among the researchers cited is psychologist Patrick Forscher, who examined more than 400 studies on unconscious bias. He said that few studies measured changes over time, and among ""the most robust of those that did"", the findings suggested ""changes in implicit bias don't last"". Dr Forscher said such training had too often been used by employers as a ""catch all"", which failed to really tackle the specific barriers for different groups. Halima Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust race equality think tank, said unconscious bias training is not always effective - and recognised the dangers of a corporate ""diversity industry"" wanting to have ""off the shelf"" training. But she warned the government would have to replace it with something better and further reaching - which addressed bias and ""ingrained views"" at a more ""fundamental level"". Ms Begum said there needed to be structural changes about fair pay, progression and work practices, rather than courses which ""make your boss feel better, but is not going to change the system"". The value of such training was defended by Jane Farrell, chief executive of the EW Group, a diversity and inclusion consultancy.  ""There is a misconception that unconscious bias training is guilt inducing and tells people off for who or what they are, which is simply not true,"" she said. ""Great unconscious bias training provides a positive and supportive environment to think through how to ensure we recruit the best staff rather than inadvertently clone ourselves,"" said Ms Farrell. Not just 'woke' Psychologist and author Stuart Ritchie said even though many staff might be required to take such unconscious bias training there was ""nowhere near robust evidence"" that it was able to change minds or behaviour. Dr Ritchie said firms might use this training to ""placate worries"", but there was a lack of evidence that it would really reduce prejudice. Jonny Gifford, who has worked with firms on diversity and inclusion, said unconscious bias had to be recognised as a ""massive problem"". But Mr Gifford, adviser to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development, warned the shortcomings of unconscious bias training should not be used to stop trying to ""make the workplace more inclusive and to reduce barriers to inequality"". ""To dismiss this as political correctness or being 'woke' is a very shaky place to be,"" said Mr Gifford. Related Topics Racism Homophobia Gender pay gap"

Here is a transcript of the key exchange: Diane Abbott:  Labour believes in the rule of the law and we hope that there will be an independent UN-led investigation. Nick Robinson:  Why wasnât there one after the last chemical attack? Why hasnât there been a single UN-led investigation since the Syrian war began eight years ago?

DA:  We think it should happen. NR:  Why hasnât it happened? DA:  Youâd have to ask the UN but we thinkâ¦ NR:  Iâll tell you why it hasnât happened, because Russia have vetoed such a call six times.

In one quiet area of Berlin, local residents are also being targeted. One victim is a bookshop-owner. Another is a historian who runs a gallery. A third is a mother who refused to accept a far-right election campaign leaflet.  What they all have in common is that they stood up against right-wing extremism. Their cars have been torched. Molotov cocktails have been thrown against their houses, and their windows have been smashed with bricks. Neo-Nazi death threats have been daubed in red paint on to the walls of homes.  But this is not a crime-ridden area. The southern end of the Berlin district of NeukÃ¶lln, where these people live, is peaceful and leafy. Full of carefully tended gardens and spotless pavements, it is a residential middle-class idyll on the edge of the city.  Heinz Ostermann runs a bookshop in a quiet shopping street. In December 2016, shortly after the right-wing populist AfD won seats in the national parliament, he hosted a discussion evening entitled ""What to do against the AfD? Stand up against racism"".  Shortly afterwards his bookshop window was smashed in. In January, his car was set on fire and destroyed. Local residents got together and raised money for a second car for him. That vehicle has also been torched.  Half of German extreme right 'prone to violence' German politician's murder raises spectre of far-right attacks  ""The worst thing is the idea that there are always idiots who think they have to go further. And that maybe it won't end with burning cars. That other things will happen next,"" he said.   Burning cars are a common sign of political violence in Berlin - easy to do, and hard to trace. In the past three years at least 13 cars have been torched by the far right in NeukÃ¶lln alone. image caption Heinz Ostermann's bookshop was smashed and two of his cars were torched Left-wing local politician Ferat Kocak's car was set on fire in 2018 as it stood next to his parents' home. Flames licked the building where he and his family were sleeping.  Mirjam Blumenthal, a centre-left SPD politician on the district council, has also been hit. Her car was set alight and a youth centre she runs has been hit by two arson attacks. Neo-Nazi symbols later appeared on the youth centre's walls, alongside the words ""We are burning with interest in you.""   According to Berlin police, more than 400 far-right criminal acts have been reported in NeukÃ¶lln since 2016. These include smashed windows, arson attacks or physical violence. But also neo-Nazi death threats, with individuals' names daubed in red paint on the walls of their homes.  Christiane Schott has been targeted for years. She was gardening in front of her home, when activists from the far-right NPD party came into her front garden to put an election flyer in her letter box. She said she did not want to accept a far-right leaflet. They threatened her, read her name on the front-door and told her that she would hear from them again. She did.  media caption Christiane says she was targeted by neo-Nazis at her home Her home has been attacked seven times - including with stones through the windows and three Molotov cocktails against the house wall. She has also been terrorised by threats to her and her daughters through anonymous phone calls and letters. I put these allegations to one of the leaders of the NPD in Berlin, Stefan Lux. As he shows me his election posters - one of them reads ""Migration Kills"" - he says there is no evidence that these crimes have been committed by the NPD or the far right. Instead he blames the violence on migrants.  ""There are Sunni Muslim Arabs, who are criminals, who act as part of criminal clans, who are competing with each other. In some of these cases it cannot be ruled out that people have been hit by criminal violence because of these competing gangs.""  Just how far to the right is AfD? Is there a growing far-right threat online? Police are treating these incidents as far-right crimes. NeukÃ¶lln is a large district, home to more than 300,000 people. The northern part of NeukÃ¶lln is urban, multicultural and rapidly gentrifying â full of hip cafes and creative international types. As rents rise, people are moving out to southern NeukÃ¶lln, where for decades there has been a small but well-established far-right scene.  image copyright AFP image caption Police gave few details but confirmed that Walter LÃ¼bcke had been shot in the head with a short-range weapon Ferat Kocak believes this is one reason why the violence here has flared up. ""This is traditionally a very white middle-class area, but that's now changing, it is becoming more multicultural, with people with different lifestyles. These far-right guys don't feel comfortable with that.""   Since 2015 and 2016, when around 1.5 million refugees and migrants came to Germany, the debate around migration has become ferocious. Recently numbers have dropped, and overall Germany has coped well with the influx, so the sense of political urgency has faded.  But pro-migration politicians from all mainstream parties are still being threatened. Police suspect that Walter LÃ¼bcke was killed because of his support for refugees. Two pro-refugee mayors have been stabbed, and hundreds of local mayors say they have been physically assaulted.  In NeukÃ¶lln victims of far-right violence say the police are not doing enough. ""They should uncover why this right-wing terror is still being trivialised,"" says historian Claudia von Gelieu, whose car was torched after she staged an event about Nazi-era oppression.  image caption Residents say the police are not doing enough to prevent far-right attacks Berlin police have told the BBC they are taking the threats, and the concerns of victims, seriously. A special unit has been set up to investigate far-right crime in NeukÃ¶lln.  But no arrests have been made. Which is why Christiane Schott, together with other local residents, comes to police headquarters in Berlin every Thursday to protest, calling for the police to do more. The violence continues.  But Ms Schott refuses to back down. ""When you're in a situation like that, you have to show where you stand,"" she says.

Habte Araya, 41, is accused of pushing the boy and his mother onto the tracks at Frankfurt's main station during an episode of paranoid schizophrenia. Mr Araya had ""at least a considerably reduced ability"" to control his actions, prosecutors say. But he could also be found to have committed murder. The charges could be raised if Mr Araya is deemed to have ""deliberately exploited the victims' defencelessness"".  At present the father of three is accused of manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, and prosecutors have applied for him to be placed in a psychiatric institution. What do we know about the attack? Mr Araya is accused of pushing the pair onto the tracks in front of an arriving train during the incident on 29 July last year. The mother was able to roll off them and escape, but the boy was killed instantly. Mr Araya is also accused of attempting to push a 78-year-old woman onto the tracks, but the woman managed to survive. Witnesses said a man was then chased and stopped by passers-by. media caption The suspect was tackled by passers-by after trying to escape Mr Araya has no connection to the victims and did not have drugs or alcohol in his system, police say. The case was widely covered in German media, and more than 100,000 euros (Â£90,000; $120,000) was raised for the boy's family in the days after the attack. It also triggered a heated debate about immigration and crime in Germany.  While Mr Araya entered the country legally though Switzerland, where he was granted asylum in 2009, police said he was on the run following a violent incident in Zurich the previous week. But he was not listed as wanted in European police databases and was able to cross borders freely, police say. This prompted politicians from the nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party to call for tighter border restrictions. Others called for bolstered security at train stations, and last week a government spokesman said plans to introduce this were currently under review.

The charity said research also shows that almost half of people with asthma are not using their inhaler properly, often without realising.  This means the full dose of medicine cannot get into their lungs where it is needed to protect them from a life-threatening asthma attack.  Instead the medicine stays in their mouth or the back of their throat, which can also make people more likely to experience side effects such as oral thrush and a sore throat. image copyright Getty Images According to national guidelines, everyone with asthma should get their inhaler technique checked as part of their yearly asthma review with their GP or asthma nurse.  The charity has also  launched videos on its website  which demonstrate how to use more than 21 different inhalers, spacers or nasal sprays including pMDI, Turbohaler and HandiHaler. It is also urging patients and parents of children with asthma to attend their asthma reviews and watch the videos with their GP or asthma nurse so they can be mindful of how to use their inhaler properly. Common mistakes include breathing too forcefully or not forcefully enough, not breathing in deeply enough, or not preparing their inhaler properly, such as shaking it before use. image copyright PA If people are struggling to get their inhaler technique right, it can also help if they use a spacer, a hollow chamber that attaches to the inhaler and makes it easier for the medicine to get into the lungs Dr Andy Whittamore, clinical lead at Asthma UK, said: ""Inhalers are the bread-and-butter treatment for most people with asthma, so it's really worrying that many people are not taking them properly, or getting their technique checked by their GP or asthma nurse. ""With so many different types of inhaler which are all used in different ways, it can be difficult for patients and healthcare professionals to know the correct way to use them.  ""It's also easy for patients to get into bad habits or simply forget the best technique following their appointment, especially if they have a new type of inhaler. ""But even a small tweak to how someone uses their inhaler can make a huge difference and could prevent them having a life-threatening asthma attack.""

A daily record of 6,914 new infections was recorded in Mexico, bringing the total to 252,165, officials said. However, the true number of fatalities and infections is thought to be much higher because of insufficient testing.

malware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419|"Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks? By Mary-Ann Russon Business reporter, BBC News Published 13 hours ago Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks. Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.  Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware. However,  the new report  comes on the back of a recent significant  security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system . And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with. So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried? How a firmware attack works  Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.  Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers. This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system. Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers unsecured Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber-crisis Cyber-flaw affects 745,000 pacemakers Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware. ""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.  Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security. ""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot."" image copyright Sophos image caption A screenshot of the RobbinHood ransomware There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as  RobbinHood , a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware  held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019 .  Another example is  Thunderspy , an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other. This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep. ""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.   ""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more."" Big organisations beware The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops). ""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC. Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software,  because they only make money  if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.  Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The pandemic has led to a sharp rise in devices connecting remotely to critical corporate network infrastructure The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws. The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years. Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.  Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.  Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds. ""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do."" Creeping soon to a network near you Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole,  to pay attention to hardware security . image copyright Getty Images image caption Hardware and firmware designers need to be included in the cyber-security discussion, say experts ""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.  ""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected."" Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.  ""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.  ""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""

The ""unusual"" Silver Sparrow strain silently affected systems in more than 150 countries around the world.  It was discovered by researchers at security company Red Canary, who have yet to determine its purpose. Apple  says it has taken steps  to restrict the potential damage the malware, which targets devices with its new M1 chip, could cause.  Its actions effectively prevent any new devices from being infected. Al Jazeera staff âhacked via Israeli spywareâ Apple's security chief charged with bribery BBC News has asked Apple to clarify how existing users can tell if they are affected.  Researchers said Silver Sparrow ""did not exhibit the behaviours that weâve come to expect from the usual adware that so often targets macOS systems"". It appears to call a command-and-control server every hour, from an infected machine, to check for ""further instructions"".  It also has a system in place to self-destruct and hide its existence entirely.   'Wake-up call' ""Though we havenât observed Silver Sparrow delivering additional malicious payloads yet, its global reach, relatively high infection rate, and operational maturity suggest Silver Sparrow is a reasonably serious threat, uniquely positioned to deliver a potentially impactful payload at a momentâs notice,â the researchers said.  Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber Security, told BBC News the attack should be a wake-up call to Mac users who assumed they were not at the same risk as Windows users of being infected by malware.  ""The malware doesnât appear to have done anything nasty,"" she said. ""But the fact it spread so fast and infected so many devices is alarming in itself.  ""No device is immune from viruses."" Computer security expert Alan Woodward said the attack appeared to be an effort to disprove this long-standing myth.  ""It is as if someone was trying a proof of concept of how to move harmful code on to Macs and to control it once there,"" he said. ""But they didnât include the truly damaging elements.""

Anti-fraud firm Upstream found the malicious code on 53,000 Tecno handsets, sold in Ethiopia, Cameroon, Egypt, Ghana and South Africa. Manufacturer  Transsion told Buzzfeed  it was installed in the supply chain without its knowledge. Upstream said it was taking advantage of the ""most vulnerable"". ""The fact that the malware arrives pre-installed on handsets that are bought in their millions by typically low-income households tells you everything you need to know about what the industry is currently up against,"" said Geoffrey Cleaves, head of Upstream's Secure-D platform. The Triada malware found by the firm on the Android smartphones installs malicious code known as xHelper which then finds subscription services and submits fraudulent requests on behalf of users, doing so invisibly and without the user's knowledge. If the request is successful, it consumes pre-paid airtime, the only way to pay for digital services in many developing countries. In total, Upstream found what it described as ""suspicious activity"" on more than 200,000 Tecno smartphones. According to research firm IDC, Transsion Holdings is one of China's leading phone manufacturers and in Africa it is the top-selling mobile manufacturer. In response Tecno Mobile said that the issue was ""an old and solved mobile security issue globally"" to which it issued a fix in March 2018. ""For current W2 consumers that are potentially facing Triada issues now, they are highly recommended to download the over-the-air fix through their phone for installation or contact Tecno's after-sales service support for assistance in any questions,"" the firm told the BBC in a statement.

Malwarebytes said it had received several complaints that pre-installed apps on the phone were malicious. It had bought one to verify the claims and informed the company selling them, Assurance Wireless, of its findings but had not received a response, it said. The Android-based phone - UMX U686CL - is made by a Chinese company. Prompted investigations BBC News has contacted Virgin Mobile - which owns Assurance Wireless - for comment but has not yet received a response. One of the pre-installed apps, which looks and operates as a wireless update program, automatically installs more apps without user consent, according to Malwarebytes. And it appears to be a variant of Adups, malware previously traced to China, which transmits text, call-location and app data to a Chinese server every 72 hours. In 2016, researcher Ryan Johnson, of security company Kryptowire, found more than 700 million Android smartphones, including some in the US, had Adups installed. His report prompted investigations from Google and the Department of Homeland Security. 'Bad behaviour' A second app containing malware, on the UMX U686CL phone, used code containing Chinese characters, Malwarebytes said. And neither of the apps were removable. ""That there's a mobile device available for purchase through a US government-funded programme raises the bar on bad behaviour by app-development companies,""  said Malwarebytes security consultant Nathan Collier in a blogpost. ""It's important to realise that UMX isn't alone.  ""There are many reports of budget phones coming pre-installed with malware and these reports are increasing in number.  ""Although I don't have the answer to this widespread issue, I can say that US citizens using the Lifeline Assistance Program and many others on a tight budget deserve more.""

It includes warnings to use password protection for information for parents. ""We know that incidents affecting the education sector are increasingly common,"" said Sarah Lyons at the NCSC. Bigger target The cyber-agency says pre-school providers and childminders are ""increasingly relying on technology to operate"" and have become an ""appealing target"" for cyber-attacks. â¢Cyber threat to disrupt start of university term University cyber-attack to take weeks to fix Cyber-criminals could be seeking personal information about children or families, and to target the payments process for parents, warns the NCSC. The  early years cyber-security advice  warns about malicious software, so-called ""malware"", and the need to protect personal information and data. ""Cyber-criminals will go after anybody, provided there's money to be made,"" says the NCSC's advice. The cyber-security agency calls for a more secure approach to sharing information, including newsletters for parents. ""You should password protect newsletters so only families who have been given the password can open them,"" says the guidance. Scam emails The NCSC says many scam emails are ""preying on fears of Covid-19"" and warns nurseries and child minders to watch out for fake messages trying to obtain information with false claims, including: resetting passwords,  receiving compensation missed deliveries. There are also warnings about protecting computer devices, including smartphones, and to guard against scam phone calls and text messages. Education at all age groups has become a significant target for cyber-attacks. A big multi-site further education college, the South and City College Birmingham, has been forced to close by a ""major ransomware attack"" - with the college telling students to  stay home this week . Universities faced a wave of cyber-attacks last autumn, targeting research and data and causing disruption to computer systems. The NCSC is now widening its advice to the early years sector. Sarah Lyons, deputy director for economy and society engagement at the NCSC, said across educational settings it was ""vital that all providers know how to secure their devices and sensitive data"". But she said many people in early years ""work on their own, without dedicated IT support"".

Google said it needed help because the number of apps being uploaded was too large for it to handle alone. Nasty Play apps can hit lots of people. Malicious code found in June was in apps  downloaded 400 million times. Security companies Zimperium, Eset and Lookout will work together on what Google has called the App Defense Alliance. The four partners will set up a combined scanning system that will scrutinise apps as they pass through Google's pipeline on the way to being offered to Android users via the Play store. Working from massive databases of known malware, behavioural clues and machine-learning models of novel threats the scanners will look for trojans, adware, ransomware, banking malware and phishing attacks. ""On the malware side, we haven't really had a way to scale as much as we've wanted to scale,"" Dave Kleidermacher, Google's vice-president of  Android security, told Wired magazine.

Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack. It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems. But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses. Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly. 'Zero-day' The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium. Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies. The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world. US warns of 'active threat' over Microsoft attack EU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves. However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected. 'Race now on' According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries.  Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves. ""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said. ""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers."" media caption Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers Webshells being dropped A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network.  Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks. Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK. Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems. Beware the second wave CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour. The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail. Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems. ""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind.

In April, 25-year-old Marcus Hutchins pleaded guilty to two charges of making malicious software, or malware. Prosecutors alleged that the malware let cyber-criminals steal online banking details from internet users. Hutchins admitted to creating two programs known as Kronos and UPAS Kit. Since Hutchins' arrest in 2017, he has remained in the US on bail.  The judge presiding at Hutchins' hearing, JP Stadtmueller, said that the 25-year-old would face one year of supervised release. However, he would be allowed to return to the UK and would not have to pay any fines. Hutchins had faced a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison. British hacker loses bid to omit evidence Arrested cyber-expert 'had used drugs' In court documents  filed earlier this year, investigators acknowledged that Hutchins, known online as MalwareTech, was no longer involved in creating malware. He created Kronos and UPAS Kit between 2012 and 2015 but later switched towards ethical hacking and cyber-security research. US prosecutors argued Hutchins still bore responsibility for his actions. This did not seem to sway the judge who praised Hutchins for ""turning a corner"" during sentencing at the court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Hutchins, from Ilfracombe in Devon, was credited with discovering a ""kill switch"" for the WannaCry ransomware, which hit the NHS and many other organisations around the world in May 2017. Three months later, he was arrested by the FBI before boarding a flight from Las Vegas to the UK. He had been attending the Def Con cyber-security conference in the city.

Fortnite-maker sues Apple and Google in UK Apple fires back in Fortnite App Store battle Epic Games has launched a legal action against Apple and Google in the US, after both removed Fortnite from their smartphone app stores. The row centred on the up to 30% cut both the tech giants take when people buy an app, subscription or in-app item on the Apple App Store or the Google Play store, as well as the difficulty in launching a mobile app without submitting to both companies' app store rules. In August Epic bypassed the Apple and Google stores to let Fortnite players buy virtual currency at a lower price, directly from it, resulting in an immediate ban from both stores. The row has attracted the attention of both regulators and politicians. Arizona's state House of Representatives passed a law this week which prohibits Apple and Google, and any other app store exceeding one million downloads, from demanding developers based in the state exclusively use its app stores. The law also covers users living in the state, but it is not yet clear how it will affect companies headquartered in other states but conducting sales in Arizona. It will now be handed to the state Senate for approval. In Europe, Apple is facing two investigations into whether it has broken competition rules, one of which relates to its app store policies.

The efforts were directed against individuals in Iran and 12 other countries, including the UK and US, Check Point said. It said the two groups involved were using new techniques to install spyware on targets' PCs and mobile devices. And this was then being used to steal call recordings and media files. One of the groups, known as Domestic Kitten or APT-50, is accused of tricking people into downloading malicious software on to mobile phones by a variety of means including: repackaging an existing version of an authentic video game found on the Google Play store mimicking an app for a restaurant in Tehran offering a fake mobile-security app providing a compromised app that publishes articles from a local news agency supplying an infected wallpaper app containing pro-Islamic State imagery masquerading as an Android application store to download further software The American-Israeli company's researchers documented 1,200 victims being targeted by the campaign, living in seven countries. There had been more than 600 successful infections, it said.

The Iranian government has not commented on the report. Furball malware Domestic Kitten's operation was first identified in 2018. And Check Point said there was evidence it had run at least 10 campaigns since 2017. Four of these were still active, with the most recent beginning in November 2020.  And it was using an Iranian blog site, Telegram channels and text messages to lure people into installing its infected software, which the researchers have dubbed Furball, which could: record calls and other sounds track the device's location collect device identifiers, grab text messages and call logs steal media files, including videos and photos, obtain a list of other installed applications steal files from external storage The 600 successful infections are said to have included dissidents, opposition forces and people belonging to the Kurdish ethnic minority in: Iran the US Great Britain Pakistan Afghanistan Turkey Uzbekistan The other group, Infy, is said to have been operating as far back as 2007.

malware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55811165|"Insurers defend covering ransomware payments By Zoe Kleinman Technology reporter Published 27 January Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies. It said insurance was ""not an alternative"" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk. However, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover. Prof Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said the UK needed to rethink its policies on ransomware. 'Funding organised crime' Ransomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of Bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold. There are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch. The Guardian reported that Prof Martin, now at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government, said he believed insurers were ""funding organised crime"" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the BBC the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector. While official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the UK, he said. ""I have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay."" While the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating. When the global aluminium producer Norsk Hydro was attacked in 2019,  it cost the firm around Â£45m , and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%,  reported Reuters .   Norsk Hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance. A spokesman for the ABI said insurers do require that ""reasonable precautions"" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves. ""Some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security,"" he said. Prof Martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem. ""But it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse,"" he said.

Christopher Taylor, 57 and from Wigan, tricked 772 people in 39 countries into downloading malware from 2012 to 2015. In 2016, after a US college discovered the programme, he told police and FBI he used it to take images and videos. However, District Judge Michael Fanning ruled that extradition to the US ""would not be in the interests of justice"". Westminster Magistrates Court was told the married father-of-three was wanted in the US to face trial on an indictment alleging one offence of wire fraud and two of computer fraud. The court heard remote access tools were found on Mr Taylor's computer along with 772 files - one per victim - containing hundreds of saved webcam images, ""including images of people in various stages of undress and involved in sexual activity"". His lawyer Ben Cooper QC argued that as ""only 7% of the victims were based in the US at the time with 93% outside of the US"", including several in the UK, Mr Taylor should face proceedings in England, where a criminal investigation has yet been launched. He added in written submissions that the 57-year-old had not used the malware for ""sexual gratification"" or targeted anyone in particular, but had an ""obsessive interest in computers and hacking"". In a written ruling, Judge Fanning said none of the people whose webcams were accessed were aware of Mr Taylor's ""illicit observation of them [and] certainly, none of them consented to it"". However, he said he did ""find extradition would not be in the interests of justice"", but added that the US government ""can appeal or they may choose to provide evidence to the authorities in the UK, so you can be prosecuted here"".

Many sites are now harbouring code that secretly uses a visitors' computer to mine the valuable e-cash coins. The code is inserted by hackers who exploit poor site security or web software bugs. The  problem has led Google engineers  to consider putting protections against mining in the Chrome browser. Freshly minted Earlier this month, hundreds of websites were found to be running code created by the Coin-Hive project. This let the web domains generate coins for the Monero crypto-currency by using the processing power of visitors' computers.  While some sites had put the Coin-Hive code on their site themselves, many others had been hacked to host the short script.  Bitcoin, and almost every other crypto-coin, works by using lots of different computers to log and verify who has done what with the electronic coins. In return for carrying out these computational tasks, called mining, users are regularly rewarded with new coins.  Palo Alto Networks said it had found Coin-Hive on almost 150 separate domains. The most popular locations for the code were porn, video and file-sharing sites.  ""The use of Coin-Hive or similar mining services is itself not a malicious activity,""  said Yuchen Zhou and colleagues at security company Palo Alto . ""It is how they are used that makes the sites malicious."" The wide uptake of Coin-Hive and the surging price of Bitcoin, now worth about $5,630 (Â£4,288) per coin, has led to the creation of many ""copycat"" coin-mining systems.  Security news website Bleeping Computer has now found 10 separate ""clones"" of Coin-Hive that mine different types of coins for their creators. ""Most are behaving like malware, intruding on users' computers and using resources without permission,""  wrote Catalin Cimpanu on the Bleeping Computer site.  On portable devices, the code can drain batteries very quickly. Some of the copycat coin-mining programs specifically target popular website creation and admin systems such as WordPress. Others, said Mr Cimpanu, are written in Javascript and their creators try to insert them wherever they can. Many anti-virus firms have updated their software so they now spot and disable mining software. Also, Coin-Hive has now launched an authorised version of its software which only mines coins if users give their explicit permission. image copyright AFP image caption Many people are looking to cash in on Bitcoin's growing value The growing number of coin miners kicked off a discussion among Google engineers working on the firm's Chrome browser about how to tackle it.  ""Yes, we should do something about it,"" wrote Ojan Vafai, a Chrome engineer on the forums where browser changes are debated.  Mr Vafai suggested getting the browser to watch for situations when mining software grabs lots of processing power from a computer or portable device.  If the browser spots this activity it would ""aggressively throttle"" browser activity to limit how much number-crunching power can be grabbed. Users would also be warned about what was happening.  The change would let users see when their browser was being used for mining and let them choose if it continued. Blocking the activity any other way would be difficult, he said. ""I'm effectively suggesting we add a permission here, but it would have unusual triggering conditions,"" he wrote. ""It only triggers when the page is doing a likely bad thing.""

""We see tens of different hacking attacks every single week. It is never ending."" A senior computer network manager for a global financial services company, Peter (who did not want to give his surname, or the name of his employer, due to his firm's anxieties surrounding cyber-security), says they are bombarded from all directions. ""We see everything,"" he says. ""Staff get emails sent to them pretending to be from the service desk, asking them to reset their log-in passwords. ""We see workers being tricked into downloading viruses from hackers demanding ransoms, and we have even had employees sent WhatsApp messages pretending to be from the CEO, asking for money transfers. ""And having staff working from home during the lockdowns has just made it worse, as it is much harder to keep an eye on everyone."" image copyright Getty Images image caption If you thought your cyber-security had been compromised, would you know how to contact your IT department? With  one in three UK workers currently based exclusively at home , and the  same level in the US , this remote working on a vast scale continues to be a major headache for the IT security bosses of companies large and small around the world. And studies shows that many firms are not taking the issue as seriously as they should. For example, one in five UK home workers has received no training on cyber-security,  according to a recent survey by legal firm Hayes Connor Solicitors.  The report also found that two out of three employees who printed potentially sensitive work documents at home admitted to putting the papers in their bins without shredding them first. Meanwhile, a separate UK study last year found that  57% of IT decision makers believe that remote workers will expose their firm to the risk of a data breach. ""In the rush and panic to set remote working practices up, even simple data protection practices were ignored,"" says Christine Sabino, a senior associate at Hayes Connor. image copyright Hayes Connor image caption Christine Sabino fears that in the haste to set up home working, some firms ignored cyber-security issues ""Companies did not provide additional security relating to computers, electronic communication, phone communication."" So what can both companies and home working staff do to make things as safe and secure as possible? Ted Harrington, a San Diego-based cyber-security specialist, and author of Hackable: How To Do Application Security Right, says firms should have started by giving all home workers a dedicated work laptop. While many larger companies may well have done this, not all smaller firms necessarily have the resources to do so, but Mr Harrington stresses its importance. ""Supply staff with laptops and other equipment that are owned, controlled and configured by the company,"" he says. ""This alleviates the burden on your people to set things up right, and ensures they follow the security controls the company wants."" image copyright Ted Harrington image caption Ted Harrington says that workers should not be too scared to report a possible cyber-security breach Definitely don't have staff using their personal computers for work, says Sam Grubb, an Arkansas-based cyber-security consultant, and author of forthcoming book How Cybersecurity Really Works. ""The main problem with using your own computer to do work is that you are not limited in what you can do on it, nor are you necessarily the only one that uses it,"" he says. ""So while you might not be visiting a shady website to download movies for free, your teenage son could be doing that exact thing on your home laptop without you even knowing. ""This makes it much easier for malware or other attacks to happen. This might affect the work you are doing, or in a worst-case scenario, lead to the compromise of co-workers' devices, or other company devices such as servers."" Mr Harrington says that the next step is that companies must set up a  VPN or virtual private network,  so that remote computers have secure and encrypted connections with the firm's servers and everyone else in the company. image copyright Getty Images image caption Should firms give home workers shredders? Mr Grubb uses a transport and wildlife analogy to explain how VPNs work. ""A VPN is like a tunnel between two cities,"" he says. ""Instead of driving through the dark forest full of tigers, lions and bears, you drive through the underground tunnel, where no one can see you driving until you reach your destination on the other side."" However, even with work laptops, VPNs and the latest cyber-security software systems in place, staff can still make damaging mistakes, such as falling prey to a ""phishing"" email - a malicious email pretending to be a legitimate one in order to trick someone into handing over sensitive data. Currently such scam emails doing the rounds include some  that are pretending to be informing the targeted person that they have been exposed to Covid-19, or invited to have the vaccine.  They ask the recipient to clink on the link, which then tries to download malware onto his or her computer. New Tech Economy  is a series exploring how technological innovation is set to shape the new emerging economic landscape. For this reason, both Mr Harrington and Mr Grubb say that it is essential that businesses give staff proper cyber-security training. ""Firms should be providing training to help their employees understand the threats they face,"" says Mr Grubb.  Ms Sabino adds that both staff and their bosses need to do their bit. She says, for example, that employees should avoid talking about work on social media, while firms should give shredders to home workers who need to print things out. image copyright Tsedal Neeley image caption Harvard University's Tsedal Neeley says that staff need to know who to call in the IT department With even the most cyber-security aware home workers just one click away from making a mistake, Mr Harrington says that firms need policies in place so that staff know who to immediately report a threat to. ""If an employee falls victim to an attack, make sure that they know a) who to contact, and b) that their outreach is welcome and won't result in termination,"" he says. ""You don't want people afraid of repercussions and thus covering up mistakes."" Tsedal Neeley, a professor of business administration from Harvard Business School who is an expert on remote working, agrees that home workers should know exactly who to report cyber-security problems to. ""Engaging with their firm's IT/cyber-security experts is crucial,"" she says. Peter, the computer network manager, says this engagement should be frequent. ""Users should be suspicious of anything that they are not 100% confident about, and it does not hurt to ask your IT department. It is better to check than be compromised.""

Panic founder Steven Frank  admitted in a blog post  that it happened after he downloaded an infected copy of the video encoding tool Handbrake. He said there was no sign that any customer data was accessed and that Panic's web server was not affected. Users have been warned to download Panic's apps only from its website or the Apple App Store.  Panic is the creator of web editing and file transfer apps Coda and Transmit, and co-published the video game Firewatch with developers Campo Santo. 'Entirely compromised' On 2 May  Handbrake was hacked , with the Mac version of the app on one of the site's download servers replaced by a malicious copy. The infected app was discovered and removed on 6 May. In what Mr Frank called ""a case of extraordinarily bad luck"", he downloaded the malicious version of Handbrake and launched it ""without stopping to wonder why Handbrake would need admin privilegesâ¦ when it hadn't before"". ""And that was that, my Mac was completely, entirely compromised in three seconds or less.""

We had the WannaCry worm causing havoc around the world for days, followed most recently by the Petya outbreak. But they are not the first to spread so far, so fast. The history of technology and the net has been regularly punctuated by outbreaks and infections.   The Morris worm In 1988, just as the internet was starting to catch on, computer science student Robert T Morris was curious about just how big it had grown. He wrote a small program that travelled around, logging the servers it visited. Bugs in his code made it scan the net very aggressively so every server ended up running multiple copies of the worm. Each copy used up a little bit of processing power so the servers gradually slowed to a halt. The scanning traffic clogged the net making it almost unusable. It took days to clean up the infection. Mr Morris was caught and found guilty of computer fraud and was fined $10,050 (Â£7,785). These days, he is a computer scientist at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT). The Morris worm has one strange parallel with WannaCry. Mr Morris was the son of the NSA's chief scientist and the WannaCry worm is based on code stolen from the NSA.  ILOVEYOU image copyright Getty Images image caption Unromantic. In May 2000, millions of Windows users found endless copies of an email bearing the subject line ILOVEYOU in their inboxes. It spread so far and so fast thanks to the booby-trapped file attached to it. Opening the file fired up the small program it contained which sent a copy of the same message to all the addresses found in a victim's address book. It was also helped to spread because all those messages appeared to come from someone a recipient knew. And the subject line made people curious too. ILOVEYOU rattled around the world for almost two weeks racking up more than 50 million infections. High-profile victims included the CIA, Pentagon and UK Parliament.  Philippine students Reonel Ramones and Onel de Guzman were found to be the creators of ILOVEYOU. They escaped prosecution because there were no computer misuse laws in the Philippines at that time. Code Red image copyright Getty Images image caption A warning about the worm was issued at Carnegie Mellon University Active in July 2001 and named after the fizzy pop being drunk by the researchers who found it, this worm targeted web servers running Microsoft IIS software.  It caused severe disruption and many websites, small businesses and larger firms were knocked offline for a while.  No-one has ever been named as Code Red's creator although on servers it compromised it displayed a message suggesting it originated in China.  Like Wannacry, Code Red exploited a known bug and caught out servers that had not been updated with a patch.  SQL Slammer image copyright Getty Images image caption This internet cafe in South Korea was practically empty after an SQL Slammer infection in 2003 This worm emerged in January 2003 and was so virulent that it is believed to have slowed down traffic across the entire net as it spread. Slammer was a tiny program, roughly 376 bytes, that did little more than create random net addresses and then send itself to those places. If it hit a machine running a vulnerable version of Microsoft's SQL server, that machine got infected and then started spraying out more copies seeking more victims. The slowdown was caused by net routers struggling to cope with the massive amounts of traffic Slammer generated while seeking out new hosts.  Again, a patch was available for the bug it exploited but many people had not applied it despite it being available for six months. MyDoom  image copyright Getty Images This Windows email worm from January 2004 is believed to hold the current record for spreading fastest - hardly surprising given that it was reputedly created by professional spammers.  It worked so well thanks to a clever bit of social engineering. The email bearing the worm was designed to look like an error message. This fiction was aided by the message's attachment which purported to hold a copy of the email that did not arrive.  Opening the attachment kicked off the malicious code that re-sent the same message to everyone in a victim's address book. Conficker image copyright Getty Images November 2008 saw the arrival of this virulent worm which hit up to 15 million servers running Microsoft software. It ran rampant and caught out hospitals, governments, the armed forces and many businesses.  The outbreak was so bad that Microsoft offered a $250,000 reward for any information leading to the identification of the worm's creator. No-one has ever been identified as its originator.  A patch closing the loophole it exploited was released by Microsoft about a month after it appeared. Even today, 10 years on, data traffic generated by machines infected with Conficker regularly turn up.

Security firm Eset found the gang controlled its malware, called Turla, by posting comments about images in the singer's gallery. The comments looked like spam but once transformed by code in the virus, directed victims to other sites. Several other compromised websites were also being used to track victims and spread the malware. Digital detective work Turla has been active since 2014 and sought to catch out government workers, diplomats and other officials, said  Eset researcher Jean-Ian Boutin.  It is believed to be run by a hacker group working for the Russian state.  Most often, he said, Turla's handlers compromised websites that targets would be likely to visit.  One compromised server asked visitors to install a booby-trapped extension for the Firefox web browser.  Digital detective work by Mr Boutin revealed that the command and control (C&C) channel set up between the creators of the extension and victims' machines was on the singer's Instagram page.  The malicious extension searched for comments that, when digitally transformed, matched a specific value. These were then converted into a website address that the compromised machine visited to report in or to update the malicious code they harboured.  Very few comments posted to the Instagram account had the key characteristics - suggesting that Turla's creators were testing or refining the control system. Mr Boutin said using social media in this way made ""life harder for defenders"". ""Firstly, it is difficult to distinguish malicious traffic to social media from legitimate traffic,"" he wrote. ""Secondly, it gives the attackers more flexibility when it comes to changing the C&C address as well as erasing all traces of it."" Mr Boutin added that he had been in touch with Mozilla, which was working on ways to stop extensions for Firefox being compromised in this way.   In a statement, Instagram said: ""We are aware of this activity and have taken action against the responsible accounts.""

This time it's the American intelligence community's familiar foe - Wikileaks - with another cache of  what look like highly sensitive secret documents , this time about the CIA's technical capabilities. The National Security Agency faced its problems when Edward Snowden passed on documents to journalists - but this time it's the NSA's sister agency.  While the NSA is the agency charged with collecting what is called signals intelligence and the CIA's job is to recruit human spies, the reality is that the technical and the human side of espionage have been drawing closer for years.  The CIA created a Directorate of Digital Innovation whose director told me  the priority was making sure the agency stayed on top of technology . While the NSA may sift global internet traffic looking for intelligence, the CIA prioritises close access against specific targets who it is interested in.  And getting into someone's electronic devices can be vital if you are trying to target them - either to recruit them as an agent or for a drone strike against a suspected terrorist. media caption Former CIA boss: latest leak on Wikileaks has 'made my country less safe' Tracking the source These latest leaks will be a huge problem for the CIA as the Snowden leaks were for the NSA (although there will be less surprise about these capabilities now since we learned so much from the Snowden files).  There is the embarrassment factor - that an agency whose job is to steal other people's secrets has not been able to keep their own.  This will be added to by the revelations that the US consulate in Frankfurt was used as a base for the technical operations which may cause problems in Germany where the Edward Snowden revelations caused intense domestic debate. Then there will be the fear of a loss of intelligence coverage by the CIA against their targets who may change their behaviour because they now know the spies can do.  image copyright Samsung image caption The CIA is alleged to have found a way to listen to conversations that took place close to Samsung TVs And then there will be the questions over whether the CIA's technical capabilities were too expansive and too secret.  Because many of the initial documents point to capabilities targeting consumer devices, the hardest questions may revolve around what is known as the ""equities"" problem - when you find a vulnerability in a piece of technology, how do you balance the benefit of leaving that vulnerability in place so the intelligence agency can exploit it to collect intelligence with the benefit to the public of informing the manufacturer so they can close it and improve everyone's security?  If an intelligence agency has found a vulnerability then other hackers might do as well. The NSA faced questions about whether it had found the right balance and now it may be the CIA's turn. There will be anger in the CIA and some of that will be directed at Wikileaks.  Wikileaks has said the source of this latest cache of documents came from a former US government hacker or contractor.  But it is an organisation that the US intelligence community has claimed may have been a route for information hacked from the Democrats by the Russians during last year's election to make it into the public domain.   No doubt the CIA will be trying to establish the exact source of the latest leak and understand the timing - coming right in the middle of an intensifying row between American spies and their own president.

Researchers at Check Point said they found the malware, dubbed Judy,  on about 50 apps  in Google's Play Store. The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators. The infected apps have been removed from the Play Store. More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, Kiniwini, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name Enistudio. The games, all of which feature a character called Judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times. 'Hid undetected' The malicious code was also found in several apps from other developers. ""It is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly,"" said Check Point. Between them, the infected apps may have been downloaded up to 36.5 million times. Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the Judy games had been updated since March this year. image copyright Check Point image caption The malware has been named after the main character in the affected games The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that ""the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected"". Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. Ad clicks The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code. Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts. This kind of delivery ""has become commonplace"", Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in Networking at the Open University, told the BBC. ""There are many tools available, and the advantage is that the malware distributor can change them remotely, which makes it difficult for anti-malware software to keep up."" The apps also display numerous adverts themselves, some of which cannot be closed until a user has clicked on them.

Hacks of banks' centralised systems had made groups of machines issue cash simultaneously, a process known as ""touchless jackpotting"", said  Group IB . The machines had not been physically tampered with, it said, but ""money mules"" had waited to grab the cash. Affected countries are said to include Armenia, Estonia, the Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain and the UK. But the company declined to name any specific banks. Dmitriy Volkov from Group IB told the BBC a successful attack could net its perpetrators up to $400,000 (Â£320,000) at a time. ""We have seen such attacks in Russia since 2013,"" he said. ""The threat is critical. Attackers get access to an internal bank's network and critical information systems. That allows them to rob the bank."" Two cash machine manufacturers, Diebold Nixdorf and NCR Corp, told Reuters they were aware of the threat. ""They are taking this to the next level in being able to attack a large number of machines at once,"" said senior director Nicholas Billett, from Diebold Nixdorf.  ""They know they will be caught fairly quickly, so they stage it in such a way that they can get cash from as many ATMs as they can before they get shut down."" 'Follow the money' A  recent report by Europol warned  of the rise of cash-machine-related malware, although it said ""skimming"" - using hardware to steal card information at the machine itself - was still more common. ""The new method is being done by somehow gaining access to the banks' central systems and infecting whole communities of ATMs simultaneously, hence multiplying the amount of money that can be stolen in a short time,"" said Surrey University's cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward. Because criminals were collecting the cash in person, it made the crime more difficult to trace, he added. ""The classic way of solving online financial crime is to 'follow the money' - but when you can no longer do this, it is very hard to find out who is behind it, even though the evidence suggests it is a very limited number of groups that have started perpetrating this type of crime.""

The apps, discovered on the Google Play Store, were designed to take control of devices before downloading malware. Unwanted ads could then be displayed to users, for example,  according to researchers at Check Point . Google did not respond to a request for comment. More than 40 guide apps for popular games were found to be capable of delivering the malware to users' devices, Check Point said. It is thought that the apps were downloaded between 528,000 and 1.8 million times, though it is not known how many of these downloads resulted in the deployment of malware. ""Since the actual apps do not contain any malicious code themselves, it's very hard to trace,"" said Daniel Padon, at Check Point. He added that when Check Point had notified Google about the apps they had been removed. But the researchers said that they continued to find more examples on the Play Store. Connecting a botnet Some of the apps were made available as long ago as November last year. When one is downloaded, it asks users for device admin permission to ensure the software cannot be deleted. It then attempts to establish a connection with a command and control server, turning the device into a bot in a botnet - a network of devices controlled from afar. Malicious software can then be downloaded. Mr Padon told the BBC that this could allow hackers to send illegitimate pop-up ads, use the device as part of a  DDoS attack , or snoop on data sent via the device's network. media caption EXPLAINED: What is a DDoS attack? He said mobile botnets were becoming more common.  ""We, other security vendors and Google have found different mobile botnets spreading via the Play Store,"" Mr Padon said.

The group, which earlier tried to sell the encrypted cache of hacking tools in an online auction, released a password for it via a blog on 8 April. Some cyber-security experts have said some of the malware is real,  but old . The NSA has not commented on the hacker group or the material that was released over the weekend. The Shadow Brokers said they had published the password as a ""protest"" about US President Donald Trump. The group wanted ""America to be great again"", the blog added. It criticised, among other things, ""[Steve] Bannon's removal from the [National Security Council]"" and the ""US military strike on Syria"". A list of alleged NSA hacking targets and the malware allegedly installed at them was also included in the release, according to some cyber-security experts. 'Not Russia fans' The Shadow Brokers say they are ""not fans of Russia or Putin"", but some experts have suggested the group may have links with the Russian government. ""Russia is quickly responding to the missile attacks on Syria with the release of the dump file password that was previously withheld,"" said Jake Williams, chief executive of cyber-security firm Rendition Infosec  in a blog .   A similar opinion was  shared on Twitter  by Dan Gonzales, a senior scientist at the Rand Corporation think tank. The Shadow Brokers were ""probably a front for or infiltrated by #Russia #cyber groups,"" he said. Neither commentator gave any evidence to support such claims. Russian officials have not commented but have strenuously denied involvement in other hacking cases associated with the US. ""If Russia had stolen the hacking tools, it would be senseless to publicise the theft, let alone put them up for sale,"" cyber-security expert James Bamford wrote in an article  for Reuters news agency . He suggested that the Shadow Brokers could be an NSA ""insider"".  image copyright AFP In a separate case, a series of cyber-attacks on 40 targets in 16 countries have been linked to a cache of hacking tools,  according to cybersecurity firm Symantec . The cache, known as Vault7, was published online by WikiLeaks and said to contain malware used by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). The agency has not confirmed whether it authored the tools. The malware analysed by Symantec had been used to infect computers in Europe, Asia and the Middle East. ""On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally,"" Symantec noted. The malware contained logs documenting changes that closely mirrored such records in Vault7 malware, the firm claimed.

A Russian man faces up to 10 years in jail for spreading a computer virus that cost victims more than $500m (Â£401m). Mark Vartanyan, 29, developed and distributed the Citadel Trojan, which lets criminals steal bank account details and hold files to ransom. US prosecutors said it had infected about 11 million computers worldwide.  He  pleaded guilty  to one count of computer fraud, in a court in Atlanta, after being extradited from Norway. Launched in 2011, Citadel was marketed on invitation-only, Russian-language internet forums used by cybercriminals. Its users had targeted the computer networks of major financial and government institutions around the world, prosecutors said.  'Illicit functionality' Vartanyan admitted to the ""development, improvement, maintenance and distribution"" of Citadel between 2012 and 2014 while living in Ukraine and Norway. Operating under the alias Kolypto, he uploaded  ""numerous electronic files""  that consisted of Citadel malware, components, updates and patches, as well as customer information. Earlier in March, David LeValley, special agent at the FBI Atlanta Office, said Vartanyan's arrest removed ""a significant player"" from the resources available to cybercriminals. ""We must continue to impose real costs on criminals who believe they are protected by geographic boundaries and can prey on the American people,"" he said. Vartanyan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison term. He will be sentenced in June.  In September 2015, a US court sentenced Russian citizen Dimitry Belorossov to four years and six months in prison after he admitted distributing and installing Citadel on to computers. The Department of Justice said its investigation into the creator of Citadel continued.

Published 15 May 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption You may be more familiar with these types of patches and worms Ransomware called WannaCry has spread across 150 countries, earned its makers about $50,000 (Â£39,000) so far and in doing so, thrown some hospitals in England in to disarray as doctors could not access patient records. It was the story of the weekend and is still ongoing - but if the terms involved were new to you, read on. Malware Short for ""malicious software"", this is a programme written to disrupt computers or the networks between them. WannaCry falls in to this category. Ransomware  A programme that scrambles a computer's files, demanding payment before they can be opened again. WannaCry asked for $300 in a virtual currency. Ransomware is not new, but WannaCry spread to more computers than previous ransomware attacks - and, because it hit computers used in hospital trusts, had a bigger impact that previous attempts. Virus A type of malware that spreads when people do things like inserting USB sticks with viruses in them, and downloading infected files. These are the reason why we are all warned not to open attachments in unexpected emails. Worm A type of virus that can spread from computer to computer by itself. Is my computer at risk? Security blogger halts ransomware 'by accident' Should you pay the ransom? Vulnerability A flaw in software that can be exploited to disrupt computers or networks Patch A software update that fixes a vulnerability. These do not exist for operating systems that are no longer supported by their makers. Operating system The important software that makes the whole computer run, from the user interface to memory, security, and applications. This might be iOS on an iPhone, Android on other smartphones, Mac OS X, Linux or Windows. Companies release new operating systems every few years; Microsoft's latest is Windows 10, which followed Windows 8.1. Windows XP, was first released in 2001 - a long time ago in technology terms - and Microsoft stopped supporting it in 2014. That means they stopped issuing security updates for vulnerabilities. Bitcoin A digital currency, in which the WannaCry makers asked for their ransom payments. It is easy to keep offline identities private when using BitCoin. The value of the currency fluctuates considerably, making it difficult to meet a ransom payment exactly.  Kill switch  A way to shut down the spread of a virus or worm.  A 22-year-old security specialist from England found WannaCry's kill switch accidentally while trying to track its spread. But he and others have warned that the people behind WannaCry could change it to get around the kill switch he found.

The software is also surreptitiously installing apps and spying on the browsing habits of victims.  The malware is currently making about $300,000 (Â£232,000) a month for its creators, suggests research. The majority of phones that have been compromised by the malicious software are in China. Remote control A spike in the number of phones infected by the malware was noticed separately by security companies Checkpoint and Lookout. The malware family is called Shedun by Lookout but Hummingbad by Checkpoint  In a blogpost , Checkpoint said it had obtained access to the command-and-control servers that oversee infected phones which revealed that Hummingbad was now on about 10 million devices. China, India, the Philippines and Indonesia top the list of nations with most phones infected by the software.  Hummingbad is a type of malware known as a rootkit that inserts itself deep inside a phone's operating system to help it avoid detection and to give its controllers total control over the handset.  The ability to control phones remotely has been used to click on ads to make them seem more popular than they actually are. The access has also been used to install fake versions of popular apps or spread programs the gang has been paid to promote.  ""It can remain persistent even if the user performs a factory reset,""  wrote Kristy Edwards from Lookout  in a blogpost. ""It uses its root privileges to install additional apps on to the device, further increasing ad revenue for the authors and defeating uninstall attempts."" Ms Edwards said the recent spike in infections could be driven by the gang behind the malware adding more functions or using their access to phones for different purposes. The malware gets installed on handsets by exploiting loopholes in older versions of the Android operating system known as KitKat and JellyBean. The latest version of Android is known as Marshmallow.  In a statement, Google said: """"We've long been aware of this evolving family of malware and we're constantly improving our systems that detect it. We actively block installations of infected apps to keep users and their information safe."" Google released the latest security update for Android this month and it tackled more than 108 separate vulnerabilities in the operating system.

On 13 December, it disclosed that Orion had been compromised. It was used as a means to penetrate US government networks and companies including Intel. It was later revealed that the product had also been compromised by malware from a suspected second perpetrator, adding a separate backdoor. SolarWinds said industry experts were helping it investigate the attacks. The Texas-based company provides computer network management tools to a wide variety of clients including British accountants Deloitte, US chip-maker Nvidia and the Californian cloud-computer software firm VMWare. A UK security source  told the BBC a small number of British organisations  had probably been affected. Some experts have warned it could take more than a year for organisations to determine whether attackers have penetrated their systems, stolen any data or installed backdoors. Sean Koessel, from the cyber-security company Volexity, warned companies: ""Don't leave any stone unturned."" ""I could easily see it taking half a year or more to figure out, if not into the years, for some of these organisations,"" he told the  Reuters news agency . The identities of those responsible for the attacks on Orion remain unclear.  However, several US government officials and security experts have pointed the finger at Russia for being behind the more devastating ""Sunburst"" attack. The Kremlin has denied responsibility.  US National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien told Fox News : ""It's clearly a sophisticated intelligence operation and no doubt was done by a state actor. And we'll get around to attribution of that at a time and place of our choosing."" Crowdstrike - a leading US cyber-security firm - has said that it believes those responsible for the Sunburst hack also  tried to breach its systems earlier this year .

They told US media that the FBI and CIA were co-ordinating the inquiry after  Wikileaks published  thousands of files.  These carried claims that the CIA had developed ways to listen in on smartphone and smart TV microphones. The CIA, FBI and White House have declined to comment on the authenticity of the files leaked on Tuesday. A CIA spokesperson told the BBC on Wednesday: ""The American public should be deeply troubled by any Wikileaks disclosure designed to damage the intelligence community's ability to protect America against terrorists and other adversaries.   ""Such disclosures not only jeopardise US personnel and operations, but also equip our adversaries with tools and information to do us harm.""

The ""stealthy"" Linux/moose botnet has one goal: infecting connected devices with malware in order to create and sell social media credibility. Researchers  have been tracking the botnet since 2015. Now they have new research into what they call the ""ego market"" for fake online fame the botnet is feeding.  Canadian researchers Masarah-Cynthia Paquet-Clouston, a criminologist with the University of Montreal, and Olivier Bilodeau, with cybersecurity consultancy firm  GoSecure, are behind  the award-winning  research  into the lucrative world of buying and selling ""followers"" and ""likes"" on social media networks . Canadians want more done to curb abuse on social media How can Facebook fix its fake news problem? China 'flooding' social media with fake posts Inside the world of Ghana's internet fraudsters Ms Paquet-Clouston said it is a global marketplace, with buyers from ""Brazil, Kuwait, China, everywhere. It seems to be worldwide.""  So who is seeking out all this fake online credibility and profile?  'Looking for fame'  Accounts of aspiring celebrities and models, small businesses, and online retailers are those typically buying batches of ""likes"" openly advertised for sale online. Average people are also paying to inflate their social media presence.  ""There are a lot, a lot, a lot of just common people looking for fame,"" she said. image copyright PA image caption Fake likes and follows for Twitter, Vine and Instagram accounts were added via moose Because so many of the accounts that bought the fake likes were ""highly self-centered,"" they dubbed it the ""ego market"".  Ms Paquet-Clouston also said the fraud scheme being run by the Linux/moose botnet creators is an almost perfect crime, with no direct victims and a lot of potential profitability.  The average price for 1,000 Instragram follows is $15.98 (Â£12.80), although the researchers note there is a huge pricing range. Creating fake social media accounts that then like and follow other accounts is not illegal but it goes against the terms of service of social media networks like Instagram. The purchase of Facebook and Instagram likes and Twitter followers is openly advertised online.  ""What's illegal and criminal is doing it through a botnet, through infected devices,"" Ms Paquet-Clouston said.  The botnet can take advantage of all kinds of connected devices like routers, even ""smart"" appliances like fridges, toasters, and coffeemakers because, unlike most home computers, they lack antivirus and security software.  The malicious program got its name because the file containing its attack code is called elan - French for moose. Ms Paquet-Clouston and Mr Bilodeau hope that their research will spur law enforcement and hosting providers to do more to target this criminal scheme. ""If we don't raise people's awareness on social media fraud, there's a demand and there's a supply and it's likely to continue,"" said Ms Paquet-Clouston. They next part of their research is looking for online actors behind the botnet.

The malware may have been designed by a state-sponsored group. It can disguise itself as benign files and does not operate in predictable ways, making it harder to detect. Experts from Kaspersky Lab and Symantec said it allows the attacker to spy on infected computers. In September last year, Kaspersky first detected the malware on an unspecified ""government organisation"" network. Since then, the firm claims to have found evidence of Project Sauron at more than 30 organisations in Russia, Iran and Rwanda. These were generally government, scientific, military, telecoms and financial organisations, according to Kaspersky. Separately, Symantec said it had found the malware in other countries, including at an airline in China and an embassy in Belgium. Hidden threat Project Sauron is able to disguise itself in a wide variety of ways - as files with names similar to those published by organisations like Microsoft, for example, and does not always use the same methods for sending data back to the attacker. ""The attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always looking for patterns,"" the company notes  in its report . ""Remove the patterns and the operation will be harder to discover."" The malware can steal files, log all keystrokes and open a ""back door"" allowing wide-ranging access to the compromised computer,  according to Symantec . Project Sauron did not share any code with other known examples of similarly powerful malware, said Kaspersky's director of threat research Costin Raiu. ""It really stands out by itself as something very, very sophisticated,"" he told the BBC. image copyright Kaspersky Lab image caption Project Sauron may have been created by a state-sponsored hacker group, researchers believe Mr Raiu also pointed out that two of the malware's victims had been infected with other highly sophisticated malicious programs. One victim was found to have Regin spyware on their systems, for example. ""This would suggest that the actor behind Project Sauron is perhaps different,"" suggested Mr Raiu. USB attack One aspect of Project Sauron that demonstrates the malware's sophistication is its ability to steal sensitive data - such as encryption keys - from computers that are not actually connected to the internet. This is known as ""jumping the air-gap"". For this, Project Sauron relies on an infected USB drive being inserted into the target computer. A hidden cache of files on the drive is then able to deposit malware on to that PC. image copyright Thinkstock image caption Project Sauron may have been used to steal confidential files at more than 30 organisations, claims Kaspersky Lab It is not yet clear how the attackers would have used this method to control an air-gapped computer, but they believe it might have been via a ""zero day"" - previously undetected - exploit that they have not yet found. ""We believe it was probably deployed in rare, hard-to-catch instances,"" notes the Kaspersky report. Project Sauron is characteristic of state-sponsored style malware, according to cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley. ""These are very stealthy, insidious attacks that can lurk in the background for years gathering information,"" he told the BBC. ""We have seen the steady progression and evolution of these sorts of attacks. As governments try to protect themselves and get clued up, it is essentially an arms race.""

For years the Necurs botnet has distributed junk mail and malware for many different groups of cyber-thieves. But the amount of malicious traffic emerging from Necurs has now dwindled to almost nothing. It is not clear what has caused the slowdown and whether traffic will return to previously high levels. One of the first signs of the disruption was seen earlier this month when email messages spreading the Dridex banking trojan and Locky ransomware caught by security firms dried up. Typically, millions of messages bearing these malicious programs are sent out every week,   Proofpoint said in a blogpost . However, the flood of messages ""essentially stopped"" last week, it said. Investigations revealed that these messages typically travelled via the Necurs botnet which was found to have gone largely offline. Rootkit The Necurs botnet is believed to be made up of about six million compromised Windows machines, many of which were enrolled when their owners inadvertently fell victim to a form of malware known as a rootkit. Analysis of some of the machines known to be part of Necurs shows that its core administration systems have disappeared, said Proofpoint. ""Data from a variety of sources show that Necurs bots are actively looking for a new command and control (C&C) system, but we have no evidence that the Necurs botmaster has been able to retake control of the botnet."" A botnet's C&C system helps the network keep running and co-ordinates the distribution of any spam or malware being sent out via the global collection of computers. Security researchers who monitor botnets and the groups that operate them said the cause of the shutdown remained a mystery. ""We cannot confirm how the botnet was brought down yet,"" Joonho Sa, a researcher for FireEye,  told tech news site Motherboard.

Residents of Pakenham, a suburb of Melbourne, have reportedly found the unmarked sticks in the boxes. Plugging them into a computer triggers fraudulent media-streaming service offers, as well as other malware, the force said in a  statement . The devices are ""extremely harmful"" and should not be used, police say. It is not uncommon for USB sticks to be used to carry and transmit destructive malware and viruses to computers. Cybersecurity experts have called the technology "" critically flawed "", and in 2014 demonstrated to the BBC how any USB device could be used to infect a computer without the user's knowledge. Berlin-based researchers Karsten Nohl and Jakob Lell said a device that appeared to be completely empty could still contain a virus. image copyright ROSLAN RAHMAN image caption USB sticks store files and other information to transfer data between devices Stuxnet , one of the most sophisticated known pieces of malware, was deployed to attack Iranian nuclear centrifuges. It is believed to have been carried on an infected USB stick. The virus infected the internal network of computers running Windows, and attacked Siemens industrial control software in order to over-ride the system. Andrew Tierney, consultant at cybersecurity firm Pen Test Partners, said the use of infected USB sticks to target households was very rare. ""However, it's still a common form of attacking businesses, where the gains are much greater,"" he said.  ""Most cybercriminals are looking for volume, so it's much easier to get hold of people's information by phishing. It's unclear whether the devices were sent in the post, but putting a USB stick in someone's letterbox by visiting the property and potentially getting your fingerprints on them creates a much greater risk of getting caught.""  The University of Illinois conducted an experiment earlier this year, dropping 297 USB drives around its campus. Had the sticks been infected, the attack would have had an estimated success rate of between 45% and 98%, the  study found . ""You'd be surprised at how many people would fall for plugging an unknown USB stick into their computer.

California-based Cyphort Labs  said that it had detected  ads placed on the site being used to spread harmful code on two separate visits during one week. The celebrity scandal site has not yet commented but  was known to have suffered a similar problem  last year. Experts suggested users install ad-blocking plug-ins to defend themselves. The phenomenon is known as ""malvertising"", and users do not have to click on the ads to find their device infected. PerezHilton.com is far from being the only publisher to have hosted the threat. Cyphort identified 1,654 unique domains that had fallen victim to the parasitical attack in 2015, and said it believed it was on course to see more than 2,000 instances this year. The New York Times, AOL and BBC.com are among other popular sites thought to have  been hijacked in this way.  since January. ""Malvertising is effective because users tend to trust mainstream, high-trafficked ""clean"" websites,""  security researcher Nick Bilogorskiy blogged . ""The attackers abuse this trust to infect them via third-party ad content."" PerezHilton.com says it is visited by  12 million people every month . Infectious ads In the first instance on 30 April, the firm said PerezHilton.com's ads caused users to download the Angler exploit kit, which is used to distribute a range of infections including ransomware. image copyright Cyphort image caption The Angler exploit kit contains code that installs a selection of viruses and other malware Then on 2 May, it said a different type of exploit kit was spread via the site. If the users had anti-virus software installed they may have been protected against some of the threats. But in many cases they would not have known they had been exposed. Like many sites, PerezHilton.com does not check each advert that appears on its pages but instead relies on third parties to place them, sharing the revenue they generate. ""The only organisations which understand the full scale of the threat are the advertising networks themselves, and they don't want to draw attention to their own failure to vet their clients,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch, a security expert at University College London. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Cyphort noted that users could protect themselves by installing ad-blocking extensions for their web browser. Dr Murdoch concurred but questioned whether this was a long-term solution. ""Ad-blockers offer a temporary mitigation against these problems but if everyone starts using them the current business model of the web will no longer be sustainable,"" he said. ""Other options for keeping the web running include asking users to pay for services - subscriptions - but few websites have been able to make this work.""

Fraud prevention organisation Cifas said fraudsters were sharing tips and getting more sophisticated in their attempts to steal money. Cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at Christmas, have tripled this year. Criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name. Dark tips The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.  Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers. Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines. Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again. image caption Details can be stolen in a variety of ways There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019. There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones. Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.  Beware Christmas parcel delivery scams, banks warn Banks 'too often blaming customers' for fraud Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police."" Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses.

Researchers from  Trend Micro  found blogs on the website had been modified to install malware known as Cryptesla on readers' devices. The malware holds files on the host machine to ransom and demands a payment to restore them. The Independent said it had removed all ads on the site while it investigated. ""It appears that an advert appearing on that blogsite may have included malware,"" said a spokesman for the newspaper.  ""There is no suggestion or evidence that any of our users have been affected by this."" The spokesman said the site affected was an old or ""legacy"" system that was now rarely visited.  According to Trend Micro, the ransomware has been present on the Independent blogs website since at least 21 November. ""We reported it to them on Tuesday - but, as of today, it is still happening,"" said Raimund Genes, chief technical officer at Trend Micro. ""Now we need to go public to warn people who are not using security software like ours."" The malware exploits a security hole in Adobe Flash Player to install itself on a victim's computer. Once downloaded, it sets about encrypting documents, rendering them useless without the key to decrypt them, for which it demands a ransom. The vulnerability in Flash has since been patched, but anybody using an old version of the web browser plug-in could still be at risk. ""For a while on Tuesday, the malware didn't trigger. But that was not the Independent solving it, it was the attackers updating the malware with a new version,"" said Mr Genes. ""My advice is to update your Flash Player. Always do it immediately when it says an update is available, because Flash remains one of the main ways attackers can compromise a system."" The spokesperson added that the media group was now looking into the incident.  ""We are currently investigating third-party advertising suppliers that are used by our externally hosted blog platform Independent blogs, which is a separate entity to independent.co.uk,"" they said. ""Less than 0.2% of the Independent digital audience visited this separate, legacy blogsite in the entire month of November,"" the spokesman added. More and more cyber criminals are seeking to subvert adverts in a bid to catch out visitors to popular sites.  This so-called malvertising has been found on many other places.

malware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-55953247|"Encrochat: Secret network messages can be used in court, judges rule By Tom Symonds Home affairs correspondent, BBC News Published 5 February Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright NCA An attempt to stop prosecutors using messages from hundreds of phones that were part of the Encrochat secret communications network in court has been rejected by the Appeal Court. Judges ruled the messages, obtained by French police by hacking the phones, were not gained by ""interception"". Under British law, evidence from interception cannot be used in court. The National Crime Agency believes Encrochat was mainly used by criminals, often to trade drugs and guns. The judgement will have major implications for cases against suspected organised criminals around the country. Due to legal restrictions, it is the first time the BBC can report the detail of arguments surrounding Encrochat,  which was penetrated by police last summer resulting in more than 1,000 arrests. The NCA, which obtained the evidence from France, said it was the biggest breakthrough ever in the fight against organised crime. Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Haulier ran Europe-wide drug ring from living room Drugs boss captured as police crack coded messages Senior officers described it ""as akin to cracking the enigma code"". The messages, sent by suspects who did not know they were being monitored, detail alleged drug dealing and murder plots, and include images and videos. Many of the cases based on ""Encro"" evidence are now going to court, and if this judgement had ruled the messages couldn't be used, some trials may have been abandoned. Under long-standing British law, designed to protect intelligence techniques from scrutiny and make criminal trials manageable, intercepted evidence can't be used in court. In 2016, Parliament passed the  Investigatory Powers Act  in a  massive overhaul  of surveillance law.  The act introduced a ""double lock""  that requires interception warrants to be authorised by a secretary of state and approved by a judge. In a 2015 factsheet on the bill before it became law,  the Home Office defined interception as ""making available the content of a communication to someone other than the sender or intended recipient during the course of its transmission. In practice that means listening to a phone call or reading an email"". But the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Burnett of Maldon, Lord Justice Edis, and Mrs Justice Whipple dismissed an appeal by lawyers for Encrochat defendants. The key legal argument centred on a piece of ""malware"" placed by French experts on Encrochat phones worldwide. It sent copies of every message to a police server. France has refused to say how, what it called ""the implant"", worked, creating legal uncertainty in British courts. Encrochat was a private messaging service that promised its users secure and secretive communications. As well as the Encrochat messaging app, the company developed a modified version of the Android operating system and sold altered smartphones known as ""carbon units"" to run its software. Switched on by pressing just the power button, the phones would load a ""dummy"" Android homescreen. But activated another way they would boot into Encrochat mode. Getting hold of an Encrochat phone was not cheap, and the subscription charges were more than Â£200 a month. Messages sent between handsets  were end-to-end encrypted : scrambled as they travelled across the internet, making them practically impossible to decode if intercepted. But in June 2020, the company warned its users that an attack had comprised its handsets and advised them to ""physically dispose of your device immediately"". If the implant had collected the messages as they were being transmitted, this would amount to interception of the communications. The defence lawyers claimed the implant was taking messages from the phones' memory, milliseconds before being sent to their wifi or mobile data transmitters and therefore the data was ""in transmission"". But the judges decided the data was in fact being stored temporarily on the devices as it was processed, before being transmitted. They said this was evident because during the actual transmission the message were encrypted, and therefore couldn't have been read, as they were by the police. The data collected also included crucial username information from the phone's storage memory, which is not sent as part of the transmission. In Friday's judgement they compared the process with that of sending a letter: ""The process involves the letter being written, put in an envelope, a stamp being attached and then the letter being placed in the post box.   ""Only the last act involves the letter being transmitted by a system, but all the acts are essential to that transmission."" media caption The BBC's Tom Symonds is shown how a customised Android phone with EncroChat installed works Families of those arrested during the fall-out from the Encrochat penetration have been arguing online that the NCA broke the law by accessing and reading messages ""in real time"", as they were being sent. They say British law enforcement agencies effectively allowed a foreign power, France, to hack the phones of 9,000 UK Encrochat users. Police claimed that in general, using an Encrochat phone, which cost thousands of pounds to own and operate, demonstrated a likely involvement in criminal activity. But suspects' supporters say innocent family members were caught up in a race to make use of the Encro messages, because police feared they would be criticised if they were not seen to take action. However the decision of the Appeal Court was that the evidence was collected lawfully.

Some in the Gulf region feared that in the dying days of his presidency Donald Trump might choose to double down on his policy of ""maximum pressure"" on Iran and launch a military strike on its civilian nuclear plants and other targets. Reports from Washington in November indicated this was one option the US president had looked at , before being talked out of it by his advisers. By contrast, President-elect Joe Biden has made it clear that he wants the US to rejoin the 2015 nuclear pact with Iran, which would mean reversing sanctions and releasing money to Tehran in exchange for Iran's full compliance. So is Iran now safe from attack?  image copyright AFP image caption Israel's defence minister has said it ""needs to have a military option on the table"" In a word, no. Israel remains extremely concerned, not just by Iran's civilian nuclear activities but by its prolific programme to develop its arsenal of ballistic missiles.  On Thursday, Israel's Defence Minister Benny Gantz was quoted as saying, in reference to Iran's nuclear development programme: "" It is clear that Israel needs to have a military option on the table . It requires resources and investment and I am working to make that happen."" Israel, as the Islamic Republic's declared enemy, sees a nuclear bomb in Iranian hands as a threat to its very existence and has urged the world to stop it before it is too late.  media caption In 2018, Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled what he claimed to be Iran's secret atomic archive Iran has always insisted its nuclear programme is purely peaceful, but its recent action  to increase the enrichment of its uranium  - one of a sequence which contravene the 2015 deal - has set alarm bells ringing.  In 1981, Israel suspected that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein was looking to acquire a nuclear weapons capability.  In Operation Babylon, it took pre-emptive action by carrying out a successful air raid using its own F15 and F16 jets, destroying Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor.  Twenty-six years later, in 2007, it did the same to Syria in Operation Outside the Box, destroying a secret plutonium reactor in the desert near Deir al-Zour just before it was activated. Out of sight But Iran is a far harder target, in terms of distance, accessibility and air defences. It is questionable whether Israel could carry out a successful air raid without US participation - something a Biden administration will be reluctant to do.  image copyright Maxar Technologies via Getty Images image caption Satellite images appear to show recent tunnel construction south of Iran's Natanz enrichment plant Conscious of the longstanding threat to its nuclear facilities - from the US, Israel and possibly the Gulf Arab states - Iran has invested money and effort in burying some of them deep underground, beneath its mountains.  Iran's nuclear industry, while ostensibly civilian, is closely entwined with its military and security infrastructure.  In fact, the Iranians have had so long to prepare for an attack that there is now a distinct possibility that their underground facilities are becoming impenetrable. Despite this, Iran's nuclear facilities remain vulnerable to attack on three fronts. Physical attack ""Iran's facilities are not impregnable,"" says Mark Fitzpatrick, an associate fellow at the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) and an expert on arms control.  ""[The one at] Natanz is vulnerable to precise bunker-busting bombing, maybe taking two precise hits: one to dig a crater and the other to burst through it or at least to shake the delicate machines enough to put them out of commission."" But Iran is a vast country and its nuclear facilities are spread out in depth.  As far back as 2012 experts suggested that the uranium enrichment facility at Fordo, buried at least 80m (260ft) inside a mountain, might be impregnable to even the devastating explosive power of US ""bunker-busting"" precision-guided bombs. ""Fordo's greater depth protects the facility against bunker-busters, but not against sabotage,"" says Mark Fitzpatrick, ""and it could be put out of commission for a period of months by blasting its entryways and airshafts"". image copyright GeoEye Satellite Image image caption Iran resumed enriching uranium to 20% purity at the underground Fordo facility earlier this month But to reach these facilities would require one, possibly two waves of air strikes penetrating deep into Iranian airspace and either evading or overpowering its air defences.  Iran has invested heavily in developing its surface-to-air missile force, including the Bavar-373 - a homegrown version of Russia's S-300 system that is capable of tracking and shooting down aircraft up to 300km (186 miles) away. The prospect of an only partially successful strike, with downed pilots captured and paraded on Iranian TV, is a strong disincentive. Human attack This has already been happening.  Israel's Mossad intelligence agency has managed to develop an extraordinarily well-informed network of agents inside Iran.  So well-informed that when Iran's top military scientist, Brig Gen Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, was travelling in a protected convoy on a lonely road east of Tehran on 27 November his attackers knew his precise route and timings.  image copyright Reuters image caption Mohsen Fakhrizadeh was known as the ""godfather of Iran's nuclear programme"" Reports differ on how he was attacked on that day. Iran claims it was by a remote, satellite-controlled machine gun mounted on a pick-up truck . Other sources believe it was by a sizable team of Mossad-trained agents, who escaped and remain at large.  Either way, Fakhrizadeh - known as ""the godfather of Iran's nuclear programme"", who US intelligence says carried out covert work on nuclear weapons - was assassinated.  How will Iran respond to nuclear scientist's killing? What were the motives behind the killing? After Trump, what will Biden do about Iran? What is behind mysterious fires at Iran sites? Israel has not commented officially on who was behind it. Before that, between 2010 and 2012, four leading Iranian nuclear scientists were all assassinated inside Iran, some by car bombs.  Again, Israel neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. But the killings show that despite heavy protection by Iranian state security, assassins are able to reach their targets, setting back Iran's intellectual capacity in nuclear technology. Cyber attack There is an undeclared war going on in cyberspace, with Iran on one side and the US, Israel and Saudi Arabia ranged against it. In 2010, a sophisticated piece of malware codenamed Stuxnet was secretly introduced into the computers controlling Iran's uranium-enriching centrifuges at Natanz.  The result was chaos, causing the centrifuges to spin out of control and setting the enrichment programme back by years.  image copyright Reuters image caption Iran said a fire at its Natanz nuclear facility in July 2020 was the result of ""sabotage"" The cyber attack was widely reported to have been Israeli, although US and Israeli experts are believed to have collaborated on developing Stuxnet.  Iran soon hit back, successfully inserting its own sophisticated malware codenamed Shamoon into the network of Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company, Saudi Aramco, disabling 30,000 computers and threatening Saudi Arabia's oil production.  Further attacks have followed. Continual risk The 2015 nuclear deal - the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action - was supposed to place such stringent curbs on Iran's nuclear activities that it would negate the need for its adversaries to consider a military strike. image copyright EPA image caption Iran's government insists the country's nuclear programme is entirely peaceful But Israel and Saudi Arabia were always sceptical about the deal because they considered it too lenient and temporary, and because it did nothing to address Iran's ballistic missile programme.  Today, they are less than enthusiastic about a Biden presidency reviving the deal unless it addresses those concerns.   Nobody in the Gulf region wants to see another conflict. Even  the 2019 missile attack on Saudi Arabia's oil infrastructure , widely blamed on Iran and its allies, went unanswered.  But as long as suspicions remain that Iran is secretly working on developing a nuclear warhead capability, then the risk of a pre-emptive attack on its facilities will always be there.

Gozi was first found in 2007 but remained active for years and is thought to have infected more than one million computers worldwide. Diplomatic row ""I knew what I was doing was against the law,"" Calovskis said in court, answering charges of conspiring to commit computer intrusion.  Calovskis was extradited to the US from Latvia in February after lengthy negotiations between the two nations over the potential sentence he would serve.  Latvian government officials initially resisted calls to hand over Calovskis, saying US plans to sentence him to more than 60 years in jail did not represent ""proportionate punishment"".  A plea agreement on sentencing reached with lawyers representing Calovskis means he will not appeal against any jail sentence of two years or less.  It is not clear whether the 10 months Calovskis spent in jail in Latvia during the extradition row will count as part of the sentence he eventually receives.  He is scheduled to be sentenced on 14 December. Two other men have been arrested in connection with the creation and administration of Gozi. Russian national Nikita Kuzmin is in jail in the US following his arrest in May 2011 on separate hacking and fraud charges.

Trustwave looked at how much cash typical cybercriminals spend and what their potential profits might be. It estimated it would cost $5,900 (Â£3,860) to buy a ransomware kit that could return up to $90,000 in one month of operation. Experts said people should take precautions and avoid paying up if they get hit. Ransomware involves a malicious program infecting a machine, scrambling key files and then demanding the machine's owner pay cash before the data is unscrambled.  According to a report from Intel-owned security firm McAfee Labs, high-tech extortion schemes nearly doubled in the first three months of 2015. Competition time ""I was frankly stunned by the figures we got from this,"" said Karl Sigler, a threat intelligence specialist at Trustwave. He said the company drew its figures from information available on hidden sites on Tor and discussion forums available on the wider web. Typically, he said, a ransomware scammer needs three separate tools to perpetrate their crimes - malware, an exploit kit and a pool of victims. The service industry surrounding web crime had grown to such an extent, he said, that all these were available to buy online. It had found forums in Eastern Europe, Asia and Latin America peddling all three. By spending about $5,900, criminals would get the ransomware malicious code, an online kit that acted as an administration system for an attack campaign and a ready source of victims from a compromised site.  If a criminal infected 10% of the 20,000 visitors to a compromised website each day and only 0.5% of those victims paid the $300 ransom being demanded, then one campaign could net a criminal about $90,000 a month, he said.  ""The money is there and the economy is there,"" he said. ""If you lack the morals and ethics it can be easy to get into.""  image copyright AFP image caption Bitcoins have helped fuel the boom in ransomware, say experts Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, said the virtual currency bitcoin has been key to the growth of ransomware. ""That's what really enabled the ransomware problem to explode,"" he said. ""Once the criminals were able to collect their ransom without getting caught, nothing was stopping them."" The latest trend was for an affiliate model in which the maker of ransomware sells the code to someone else who then uses it.  The market had become so popular that gangs were now competing against each other fighting for market share. ""Almost all of them deliver the 'goods',"" said Mr Hypponen. ""If you pay, you will get your files back. Some even run support forums to help you recover. ""This is because they need good online reputation: otherwise nobody would pay,"" he said. Mr Hypponen's advice to avoid falling victim was to take backups, ensure software is up-to-date, be suspicious of message attachments and run comprehensive security software. ""And,"" he said, ""don't pay money to these clowns unless you absolutely have to.""

The news came as Apple said it was going to make its Xcode program - the tool used to build apps for its operating system - easier to download in China, where the problem originated. Some Chinese firms said slow download speeds behind the Great Firewall led them to seek locally held, bootlegged versions of Xcode that they did not know were infected with malware. Apple's marketing boss Phil Schiller said the firm would offer domestic downloads in China in a bid to speed up downloads and convince people to install only the official software. App developers are not blocked from downloading the official version of Xcode. But censorship controls, along with low investment in infrastructure for international connections, make using services based outside China a painful process for some. ""In the US it only needs 25 minutes to download. China may take three times as long,"" Mr Schiller told Sina.cn. Security review The counterfeit versions served malware that infected apps built on them, allowing the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they controlled. The US security firm Palo Alto Networks said it believed the number of infected apps was likely to be ""far greater"" than the few dozen initially thought. According to FireEye, another security company, the figure could be as high as 4,000. The App Store had previously been almost entirely free of malware, and it was unclear how the altered code withstood Apple's app approval process, in which developers often wait a week for reviews of updates to their apps. ""These reviews are legendary for how particular Apple is,"" said Robert Walker, founder of mobile dating app Cuddli, who worked for Microsoft in China. ""Supposedly, a security review is part of that. But they missed this repeatedly over dozens of different applications. A huge mistake on their part."" Security consultant Graham Cluley said: ""Apple security, for so long priding itself on the tight ship it maintains over apps that get into its App Store, has definitely suffered a bloody nose.

The list includes Hyatt premises in Canada, the US, the UK, Jordan, Chile and Indonesia and involves almost half of its properties. The firm is offering one year's free protection to people who used their cards in one of the compromised hotels. The infection took place between August and December last year. The Chicago-based Hyatt group has 627 properties in its portfolio. It said 250 hotels, all of which it manages directly, had been infected.  In a statement , Hyatt's global president of operations Chuck Floyd said that ""unauthorised access"" to payment card information - including the names of cardholders, card numbers and expiry dates - had been detected primarily in restaurants but also at spas, golf shops, parking and some front desks inside the hotel chain. ""We encourage you to remain vigilant and to review your payment card account statements closely,"" he said, adding that cards could now be used ""with confidence"" inside the hotel chain following the investigation. Although he said the company had ""worked quickly"" with cybersecurity experts and law enforcement to address the issue, the infection appeared to have gone unnoticed for about four months. The period of risk for affected customers was between 30 July and 8 December 2015, Mr Floyd wrote. Hyatt has now teamed up with a company called CSID, which specialises in identity protection and ""fraud restoration"" services, to offer  one year's free coverage for those whose cards may have been compromised . Security expert Brian Krebs  noted on his blog  that the Hilton, Starwood, Mandarin Oriental, White Lodging and the Trump Collection hotels were all hit by payment information breaches last year.

The software shares the cards with the virus's creators who then join the same game and try to fleece the victim. The sneaky malware has been found lurking in software designed to help poker fans play better, said the security firm that found it. The software also targets other useful information on a victim's computer such as login names and passwords. Card counter The malware targets players of the Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker sites, said Robert Lipovsky, a security researcher at Eset,  in a blogpost .  When it infects a machine, the software monitors the PC's activity and springs to life when a victim has logged in to either one of the two poker sites. It then starts taking screenshots of their activity and the cards they are dealt. Screenshots are then sent to the attacker. The images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player ID. This, said Eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. Using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage. ""We are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way,"" wrote Mr Lipovsky. Eset found the Windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, PC utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases. Eset said the spyware had been active for several months and most victims were in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia and the Ukraine.

The credentials were found by security firm Palo Alto Networks while investigating suspicious activity on many Apple devices. It uncovered a malicious software family that targets jailbroken iPhones. The majority of people hit by KeyRaider are in China but Palo Alto said iPhone owners in 17 other nations had also been caught out.  The theft is believed to be the biggest ever involving Apple accounts,  said Palo Alto in a blogpost outlining its findings . User reports of unauthorised payments being made via iTunes accounts and of apps being installed unexpectedly alerted Palo Alto to a potential problem. It found that an attacker had made changes to software used on jailbroken iPhones. A jailbroken iPhone is one that can run apps that are not sourced from the main Apple app store.  The main purpose of the booby-trapped software was to let people get apps and other Apple content without paying for them. The malicious version of the code, dubbed KeyRaider by Palo Alto, spied on transactions to scoop up login names, passwords and other credentials. The stolen data was sent to a remote server run by the malicious hackers behind KeyRaider. Apple's phones are the third most popular in China behind Huawei and Xiaomi,  suggests research .  Security firm Symantec said iPhone-owners were taking a risk by jailbreaking their device because this can remove the security checks Apple introduced to thwart malicious apps. ""Third-party app stores often don't have the same controls and policies in place when it comes to the software they distribute,"" it said ""and may be used to harbour malicious copies of well-known apps or other malware.""

Mobile security firm Lookout said the virus, called NotCompatible, was the most sophisticated it had seen. The cyberthieves behind it had recently rewritten its core code to make it harder to defeat, it said.  Mobile malware aimed at smartphones is steadily getting more complex, said security company Wandera. Jeremy Linden, a security analyst at Lookout, said: ""The group behind NotCompatible are operating on a different plane to the typical mobile malware maker.""  Victims for rent Usually, he said, mobile malware campaigns lasted only a couple of weeks but the NotCompatible creators had been operating for more than two years. The bug first appeared in 2012 and was now on its third iteration, he said, adding that the latest version had been rewritten recently and was now as sophisticated as the malware aimed at desktop computers. ""They are successful enough to make it worth ripping out the back end of the malware to make it be much more stable and resistant to efforts to take it down,"" he said. This latest version employed end-to-end encryption, peer-to-peer networking technologies and stealthy operating procedures to help it avoid being spotted and removed, he said. image copyright AFP image caption Apple devices have been targeted with malware that seeks to steal data from handsets Phones infected with NotCompatible were enrolled into a network that is now being rented out to any crime group that needs a ready source of Android users. Mr Linden said compromised phones had been used in a variety of scams including sending spam, attacking Wordpress blogs and buying tickets for popular events in bulk that would then be resold at a significant profit.  ""This is the most technically sophisticated threat we are facing and it's the most worrying to us,"" said Mr Linden.  NotCompatible is being spread via spam and websites seeded with booby-trapped downloads, he said and urged Android users to be wary of any app that required a security update to be installed before it was run. 'Growing confidence' Mobile malware was growing in popularity among cybercrime groups because smartphones were now so central to modern life, said Eldar Tuvey from mobile security monitoring firm Wandera ""We're definitely seeing the bad guys focus their attention on mobiles,"" he said. ""That's because more time is now spent on apps on phones than desktops."" While Android had long been a target of malware makers, the appearance of the Wirelurker and Masque malware families that both targeted Apple gadgets showed the growing confidence of cybercriminals, he said. They were keen to get a foothold on a phone so they could harvest useful data that they could sell or use to make phishing emails look more plausible, or to lever open accounts for social networks or other web-based services. With 70% of people reusing passwords across many different sites and services, it was no surprise that criminals regularly got access to these accounts, he said. Many were aided by ""leaky"" apps that passed around log-in names, email addresses and other credentials in unencrypted text, said Mr Tuvey. ""The trend is only moving in one direction,"" he said. ""The criminals are sharing information between themselves and they are learning about how to improve the efficiency of their attacks.""

It said bogus ads for shoes briefly appeared among the selection of banners displayed on DailyMail.com. Instead of online shops, it said, the ads linked to malware that could expose computers to ""ransomware"". Ransomware encrypts files on a victim's computer and asks for a payment to decrypt them again. The practice is known as ""malvertising"". Security company Malwarebytes said it had made the discovery last week and had published  a report about its findings online . A spokesman for the Daily Mail later said that it had not been contacted by Malwarebytes about its findings in advance. However, the BBC has seen evidence that the security company did in fact try to contact the newspaper about the issue last Friday. By Monday morning, the security company said that the fake ads had been removed. Bogus bargains Malwarebytes said the banners, purporting to be for an online shoe retailer, were published via a bogus ad server. From there, they were said to have been distributed via an advertising network that presents ads to readers on the Daily Mail's website. If a user clicked on one of the ads, said the security firm, they would be redirected to a well known piece of malware called the Angler Exploit Kit, which attacks vulnerabilities in Internet Explorer and Flash. There are various ways to protect yourself from ransomware, according to Tony Berning, senior manager at software company Opswat. ""To protect against ransomware, users must back up their data regularly,"" he said. ""In addition to this, an important defence against ransomware is the use of anti-virus engines to scan for threats.  ""With over 450,000 new threats emerging daily, anti-malware engines need to detect new threats continuously, and will inevitably address different threats at different times,"" Mr Berning said.

The advertising, apparently for a service called Sex Messenger, also contained tools for identifying whether the user was genuine rather than a bot. It appeared on porn site xhamster, one of the world's most visited domains. However the firm said porn sites are no more dangerous than mainstream ones. The ad has now been removed. The malware, which also made use of the security of cloud-based platforms to hide what it was doing, worked by directing the user to a fraudulent page once it had determined that they were running Microsoft's Internet Explorer and had identified the device's security settings. So-called ""malvertising"" often installs ransomware on to a victim's machine. It loads a page containing false accusations of criminal activity and instructions for paying a fine. ""These efforts ensure that only real users will get to see the exploit kit landing page therefore excluding honeypots and security researchers alike,""  wrote Malwarebytes security consultant Jerome Segura in a blog post. Although in this case the ad was popping up so often that researchers were able to study it after all. Xhamster is currently ranked the 71st most visited website in the world by web analytics firm Alexa and attracts hundreds of millions of monthly users.  But the online porn industry does invest in security, Mr Segura added. ""There's this idea that adult sites are more dangerous to visit than 'regular' sites,"" he  told Tech Week Europe .  ""I don't believe it's entirely true especially for the top sites because they do dedicate a lot of resources to fighting fraud and malware.

The Foreign Office said Russia's GRU military intelligence carried out ""cyber reconnaissance"" against officials and organisations involved. The alleged attacks took place before the Games were postponed until 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic. Officials did not, however, specify the nature or extent of the cyber-attacks in detail. At the same time, the US Department of Justice announced  charges against six Russian GRU officers for alleged cyber-attacks   serving ""the strategic benefit of Russia"". The group sought to disrupt the 2018 Winter Olympics, the 2017 French presidential election, and Ukraine's power grid, US prosecutors said. ""No country has weaponised its cyber capabilities as maliciously or irresponsibly as Russia,"" assistant attorney general John Demers told a press conference, calling it ""the most disruptive and destructive series of computer attacks ever attributed to a single group"". UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the attacks targeting organisers, sponsors, and logistics providers of the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games were ""cynical and reckless"". ""We condemn them in the strongest possible terms,"" he said. ""The UK will continue to work with our allies to call out and counter future malicious cyber-attacks."" Foreign Office officials also revealed details of the attack on the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea. On that occasion, the operation was a ""false flag"" - one designed to look like it came from North Korea or China, they said. The UK and US have been trying to increase the pressure on Russian hackers for a number of years by publicly exposing their activity, and they will be hoping that news of Moscow targeting an event like the Olympics will draw wider support from other countries.  It is thought that this attempt at disruption, like the 2018 attack on the Winter Olympics, was in response to Russia being excluded from sporting events for doping violations. Two years ago, some attendees were unable to print tickets for the opening ceremony, leaving empty seats, and this is the first time the UK government has formally attributed that attack to Russia. Western intelligence officials believe there is some disruption caused by the exposure of Moscow's practices and specific techniques, forcing the hackers to adapt.  But there is not much sign that the public campaign is forcing a rethink over their willingness to engage in such activity. The 2018 Winter Olympics operation is said to have taken aim at the opening ceremony - targeting broadcasters, officials, sponsors, and even a ski resort.  The UK's National Cyber Security Centre, which helped to analyse the information, said the 2018 attack was ""intended to sabotage the running of the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games"" by disabling its networks. One method was to deploy malware that deleted data from the computer systems used that year. It was prevented by IT officials cutting off affected computers and replacing them entirely to prevent the malware from spreading, it said. UK officials have attributed several cyber-attacks against major organisations to GRU units operating under various names such as Sandworm, VoodooBear and Iron Viking. The Foreign Office itself was subjected to one such attack in 2018, when GRU-affiliated hackers attempted to access its computer systems using a spearphishing attack.

Shylock was said to have been installed on more than 30,000 machines worldwide, but mostly targeted bank accounts of people living in the UK. As ever, the NCA urged the public to make sure their security software was fully up-to-date. The action follows a similar effort led by US authorities last month. The Zeus botnet was said to have infected more than a million computers worldwide.  The US is seeking a Russian man, Evgeniy Bogachev, in connection with the operation. Shakespeare This latest action has been led by UK intelligence services, working in conjunction with security experts based in The Hague. ""The NCA is co-ordinating an international response to a cybercrime threat to businesses and individuals around the world,"" said Andy Archibald, deputy director of the NCA's National Cyber Crime Unit.  ""This phase of activity is intended to have a significant effect on the Shylock infrastructure and demonstrates how we are using partnerships across sectors and across national boundaries to cut cybercrime impacting the UK."" The Shylock malware - so named because passages from Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice were found within its code - affected computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system.

At its height in September 2014 the malware, called Beebone, was controlling 100,000 computers a day. Criminals used it to help steal passwords and download other programs to the infected computers.   Around 12,000 victims are being asked to use new online clean-up tools to remove it.    'Mystique-like' morphing  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Beebone downloaded other malware which could steal passwords and banking details Once on a victim's computer, Beebone operates like a downloader application that can be controlled by the suspected criminal gangs behind the program.  It was used to force victims' PCs to fetch other malware from the internet including password stealers, ransomware, rootkits, and programs designed to take down legitimate websites.  Computer security firm Intel Security, which helped law enforcement agencies to stop the malware, said it had seen Beebone change its identity up to 19 times per day to avoid more traditional ""signature detection"" anti-virus methods.  Intel Security's chief technology officer Raj Samani told the BBC: ""Beebone is highly sophisticated. It regularly changes its unique identifier, downloading a new version of itself, and can detect when it is being isolated, studied, or attacked.  ""It can successfully block attempts to kill it.""    Operation Beebone Operation Beebone was carried out by the Joint Cybercrime Action Taskforce set up by the European Union to tackle cross-border internet crime. The team finally managed to tackle the malware by stopping it from connecting to servers on the net used to control and send it instructions.  Nearly 100 .com, .net, and .org domains have been ""sinkholed"" - the process by which traffic meant for specific IP addresses is redirected from suspected criminal-controlled sites to the investigating authorities. This allows detectives to ""see"" how the application behaves and to intercept requests for further instructions by the malicious software.   The FBI assisted in redirecting traffic from most of the sites being used by the gangs because they were operated from the United States and are under US jurisdiction.  The operation also involved private security firms Intel Security, Kaspersky Labs and Shadowserver. The taskforce now believes it has isolated the morphing malware so criminals can no longer make use of it. Sustained threat Head of operations at the European Cybercrime Centre, Paul Gillen told the BBC the agency would now look at whether those behind the attacks could be identified and brought to justice. He admitted the solution the taskforce had found was not a permanent one: ""We can't sinkhole these domains forever. We need those infected to clean up their computers as soon as possible."" Several security vendors have created a free tool to remove the Beebone malware including F-Secure, TrendMicro, Symantec and Intel Security. image copyright Europol image caption Symantec is one of several private security firms signed up to help EC3 But victims need to first realise they have the malware on their systems before they can download the removal tool.  Raj Samani said those who have the malware ""will be notified by their internet service provider"".  ISPs in each affected country will be handed a list of suspected victims to contact by the taskforce.   Dangerous threat The Beebone malware was described by the Europol taskforce as ""very sophisticated"". Some security experts believe the consequences of the attack could have been much worse.    Portcullis Security in the UK advises various British government departments on cybersecurity issues. Its director, Paul Docherty, told the BBC:  ""The fact that it [the malware] is complicated suggests that it could be used for more targeted attacks. If those responsible were able to harness similar difficult-to-detect code they could potentially move the point of attack from home users to corporate users or other entities which typically hold large amounts of sensitive, valuable data."" Mr Docherty said computer users should have anti-virus software installed and that it was essential that they kept it up-to-date. He warned against members of the  public underestimating how valuable their computer might be to criminal hackers.  ""There is still a general consensus that, It won't happen to me, I have nothing anyone could want. However, when you discuss with people what they actually use their technology for this changes very quickly.""  Future challenge The total number of computers infected by Beebone is relatively modest compared with some recent malware take-downs like GameOver Zeus. Security experts believe this is because the malware was not spread by mass emailing potential victims with poisoned internet links, an approach known as spearphishing. Intel Security said Beebone  was more commonly spread through hardware like USB drives, or data discs.     Now remaining victims are being asked to clean up their computers as soon as possible.  Mr Samani said it is likely those who have Beebone on their computers ""were likely to have a lot of other malware too because of the nature of Beebone as a malware downloader itself"".  But there is another good reason why victims will want to move on quickly, says Mr Docherty: ""Clean-up after infection could be complicated, as this [criminal] campaign has used a constantly changing (polymorphic) dropper to implant malware, it is possible that it has also installed code of a similar nature to re-enable access to the systems following clean-up.""

Further inquiries revealed a total of 467 Mac programs listed on the Maiyadi App Store had been compromised to include the malware, which in turn had been downloaded 356,104 times as of 16 Oct. Infected software included popular games including Angry Birds, The Sims 3, Pro Evolution Soccer 2014 and Battlefield: Bad Company 2. Once the malware was on the Mac, it communicated with a command-and-control server to check if it needed to update its code, and then waited until an iPhone, iPad or iPod was connected. When an iOS device was connected the malware would check if it was jailbroken - a process used by some to remove some of Apple's restrictions. If it was jailbroken, WireLurker backed up the device's apps to the Mac, where it repackaged them with malware, and then installed the infected versions back on to the iOS machine. If it was not jailbroken - which is the case for most iOS devices - WireLurker took advantage of a technique created by Apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staff's handsets and tablets.  image copyright PAlo alto networks image caption Wirelurker hides its code inside software that is initially downloaded to a Mac computer This involved placing infected apps on the device that had been signed with a bogus ""enterprise certificate"" - code added to a product that is supposed to prove it comes from a trustworthy source.  To ensure the devices accepted this certificate, a permissions request was made to pop up on the targeted iOS device on the user's first attempt to run an infected app.  It simply asked for permission to run the app, but if the user clicked ""continue"" it installed code called a ""provisioning profile"", which told the iOS device it could trust any other app that had the same enterprise certificate. Palo Alto Networks remarked that while this technique was not a new concept, it was the only known example of it being used to target non-jailbroken iOS devices in the wild. Once active, the malware is used to upload information about the machine to the hackers, including phone numbers from its Contacts app, and the user's Apple ID. Different versions of WireLurker also automatically installed new apps on the devices - including a video game and a comic book reader. image copyright palo alto networks image caption The hackers fooled users into approving a bogus enterprise certificate While these were innocuous, experts warn they could represent a test run for other more damaging software. ""People have got very used to iOS being secure and there is a danger they may be complacent about the risk this presents,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""Now Apple knows what it's looking for, it should be able to shut it down relatively easily. But it shows that people are trying to attack Apple's operating system and the firm can't take security for granted.""  Under attack News of the attack comes after tech giant Apple's iCloud storage service in China was attacked by hackers trying to steal user information just last month. Chinese web monitoring group Greatfire.org said that hackers intercepted data and potentially gained access to passwords, messages, photos and contacts. They believed the Beijing government was behind the move. But the Chinese government denied the claims and was backed by state-owned internet provider China Telecom, which said the accusation was ""untrue and unfounded"". China is home to the world's biggest smartphone market and Apple saw its iPhone sales there jump 50% in the April to June quarter from a year earlier. To minimise the risk of attack, Palo Alto Networks has recommended that users: Do not download Mac apps from third-party stores Do not jailbreak iOS devices Do not connect their iOS devices to untrusted computers and accessories, either to copy information or charge the machines Do not accept requests for a new ""enterprise provisioning profile"" unless it comes from an authorised party, for example the employer's IT department Related Topics Cyber-security Apple Companies More on this story China denies backing iCloud hack Published 21 October 2014 Apple's iPhone sales boost earnings Published 20 October 2014 Apple reveals its thinnest iPad Published 16 October 2014 Related Internet Links Palo Alto Networks Tencent Apple Alan Woodward The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

After an update, essential components in two Panda Security antivirus programs became corrupted, leading them to be mistakenly identified as malign and quarantined. Panda said a fix had been released and warned that rebooting affected systems could exacerbate the issue. It asked those affected to get in touch so it could help fix their machines. One security expert noted the irony. ""People's first response is to turn [their computer] off and back on again, but in this case it seems like the wrong thing to do,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University. The ""last thing"" people would expect to cause their computers to break down was its security software, he said. Corrupted files Panda Security said that the signature file in both its PCOP and its Retail 2015 packages became corrupted. ""The signature file was repaired immediately. Additionally, a solution for all affected products has been automatically deployed. However, in certain environments it is possible for the incident to persist."" It added a  list of steps  that affected users could take to ensure that their system was clear of the issue. Prof Woodward said the episode was ""not a great advert for Panda"". He said he had heard of some companies losing the use of multiple computers to the issue. He added that data loss was a risk if machines were rebooted.

Mazar can gain administrator rights on phones, allowing it to wipe handsets, make calls or read texts. However, it will not install on phones where the language is set to Russian. Additionally, users would have to have unchecked a default setting on Android devices that ensures software may only be installed from trusted sources. Security firm Heimdal thinks the malicious texts could have been sent to over 100,000 phones in Denmark, though it is not sure whether users in other countries may have received the messages. This is believed to be the first time Mazar has been detected in widespread, real world attacks. In the examples studied by Heimdal, users receive an innocuous-looking text providing a link to what looks like a multimedia message. This link downloads Tor software, which enables anonymous internet connections, to the phone. Afterwards, the malware itself is downloaded through Tor in an apparent effort to hide the source of the malicious software itself. Russian refusal One interesting feature of Mazar is that it cannot be installed on smartphones running Android with ""Russian"" selected as the operating system's language. Similar controls have been detected in PC malware in the past, according to Morten Kjaersgaard, chief executive of Heimdal. Infected phones are at risk from a range of threats - from attackers secretly monitoring devices to reading a user's texts or even erasing all personal data from the handset. Or, the attacker could simply send a lot of texts to premium numbers. ""It can do a lot of damage - maybe running up a big phone bill for which the customer would be liable,"" Mr Kjaersgaard told the BBC. ""It's not like when you use your credit card and there's an international standard for banks covering [fraud]."" image copyright Thinkstock image caption The malicious software won't affect Russian language devices Advice to users Heimdal tested phones running Android Kitkat (version 4.4) but Mr Kjaersgaard believes the issue is likely to affect all prior versions as well. Later versions of the operating system have not been tested. The advice to users is to never tap on web links in text messages from unfamiliar phone numbers and to be cautious of links even if the message appears to be from a known contact since sometimes this can be spoofed. ""Over one billion devices are protected with Google Play which conducts 200 million security scans of devices per day,"" a Google spokeswoman said. ""Fewer than 1% of Android devices had a Potentially Harmful App installed in 2014, and fewer than 0.15% of devices that only install from Google Play had a Potentially Harmful App installed,"" she added.

By James Clayton and Cody Godwin North America technology reporters Published 28 January Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption President Biden You might think the world's most powerful man would have access to any gadget he chooses - but when it comes consumer tech, Joe Biden may be sorely disappointed.  The electronic devices around the US president are perhaps the most prominent hacking targets in the world.  ""The odds are zero, that [Russia] aren't targeting world leaders,"" Harvard Kennedy School lecturer Bruce Schneier says. Back in the 2000s, this wasn't such a big problem - the only personal devices that could be hacked were computers and non-smart mobile phones.  And why would the president need a mobile, when he could ask to be patched through to anyone in the world on a secure line. But that all changed in 2009, when Barack Obama took office.  He was so attached to his Blackberry he fought with security advisers for weeks to keep it - a fight he eventually won ""through a compromise that allows him to stay in touch with senior staff and a small group of personal friends"", according to an official. And since then, the range of tech devices a president might want to use has steadily increased - giving security advisers sleepless nights.  The Obamapad When the iPad came out, in 2010, of course, the president wanted one.  So national-security advisers created the ObamaPad, a ""hardened"", more secure iPad, which, a former adviser tells BBC News, was replicated for his staff. ""In the Obama administration, for senior staff, it was common to have an iPad that had... certain modifications to it,"" says Ari Schwartz, a National Security Council cyber-security official during the Obama administration. image copyright WHITE HOUSE POOL (ISP POOL IMAGES) image caption Barack Obama in 2014 Nevertheless, the tech set-up of the White House remained somewhat old fashioned. ""There's no wi-fi,"" Mr Schwartz says. ""And we actually had a little bit of a discussion at one point about adding wi-fi. ""It was more of a discussion like, 'Why can't we have wi-fi in the White House?' ""And the feeling was, 'Well, then you're opening up security lapses.'""  The Obamas' residence eventually installed wi-fi. But it remained patchy at best , according to the family. image copyright SAUL LOEB image caption Donald Trump in 2020 Donald Trump, arguably the most famous man on Twitter during his term, also insisted on using a personal device, reportedly a series of ""burner"" phones  used briefly and then replaced  for security reasons. But he was  also widely reported to be sceptical of computer use  and email, preferring paper for most communications. Biden's Peloton If the iPad gave tech advisers a few sleepless nights back in the day, the internet of things, today, represents a recurring nightmare. ""Everything is becoming a computer,"" Mr Schneier says. ""And those computers are vulnerable.  ""Whether it's your Peloton bike or your phone, your refrigerator, your thermostat, toys, your car - these are all vulnerable to hacking.""  And that is a problem for President Biden, who seems to like his gadgets.  image copyright SOPA Images image caption One of the watches Joe Biden wears is an Apple Watch He has been photographed wearing an Apple Watch and reportedly owns a  Peloton exercise bike  that comes with a computer screen, camera, and microphone all connected to the internet.  Can that be made secure?  ""You can do things like modify the hardware, like ripping the camera out, that's something that the NSA [National Security Agency] can do,"" Mr Schneier says. And that may be safer. But it may also defeat the purpose of having high-end technology in the first place. Herbert Lin, of the University of Stanford, says: ""It's very rare that you find a device that can't be hacked. ""Most devices that can't be hacked are pretty useless because they can't communicate."" 'Smart' isn't safe The safest thing is simply to not use any tech gadgets at all.  But, as the previous two presidents proved, that is a hard thing to tell the commander-in-chief. According to Mr Biden's  biographer Evan Osnos , the president also uses the Apple News app. And this too could be a problem.  In fact, Mr Schwartz says, software can be hardest to protect. ""The software side, it's a lot harder to maintain good security around, because everything is updated from afar now,"" he says. ""You might be totally secure right now, the day that you buy the product.  ""But then a year from now, someone could come in and install malware into it and destroy the security that you had originally."" And Mr Schneier shares these concerns. ""Everything is a potential vulnerabilityâ¦ Apple News, everything, because it's all connected, because anything can affect any other thing,"" he says.  ""That's why this is so complicated.  ""That's why ditching the device is often the best security advice, even if it's not practical.""  Nightmare scenario Late last year, news broke US government networks had been compromised by suspected Russian hackers. The massive Solar Winds hack reportedly affected the treasury and commerce departments and Homeland Security.   Even worse, once the hackers were in, they lay undetected for months.  The hack showed two things:  foreign actors are looking for cracks in US cyber-security there are gaps to be found  The nightmare scenario is a president's device is hacked, which then goes unnoticed.  And that a hack has happened so recently - and so close to the White House - will have President Biden's security team worried.  ""Say the president's iPhone is hacked,"" Mr Lin says.  ""Now, you have a homing beacon that the president is carrying."" Mr Biden is entering a White House nervous about cyber-security.  And advisers know what is most secure and what the president wants are not usually aligned.  President Biden may be the most powerful person in the most powerful country in the world.  But he may also have a fight on his hands to keep the gadgets many others take for granted. James Clayton is the BBC's North America technology reporter based in San Francisco.

Investigators from the National Crime Agency found images on the computer of Stefan Rigo, 34, including ones of people involved in sexual activity, some of whom were on Skype at the time. Rigo was arrested in November last year during an international investigation. He has been given a 20-week suspended sentence and placed on the sex offenders' register for seven years. Rigo targeted a variety of victims after gaining remote access to their computers' webcams.  Incriminating images on his computer were discovered after a forensic examination. Out of 14 confirmed individuals he spied on - roughly half were people he knew personally, an NCA spokesman told the BBC. At a hearing in July, Rigo pleaded guilty to one count of voyeurism and another computer-related offence. The court took Rigo's guilty plea into account when handing down the 20 week sentence. As well as being placed on the sex offenders register, Rigo will have to complete 200 hours of unpaid work within the next 12 months. Victims 'unaware' Investigators found and arrested Rigo after raiding two addresses in Leeds. The hacker had used his ex-girlfriend's details to purchase BlackShades, a remote access trojan (RAT) which allows for a high level of surreptitious control over a victim's computer.  ""The problem with RATs specifically is a lot of the time people don't know they're being affected,"" the NCA spokesman said. ""In the case of Stefan Rigo that we were looking at, his victims weren't aware."" BlackShades has been around since 2010 and has been sold for as little as $40 (Â£26), explained Jens Monrad at cyber security firm FireEye. ""The application in itself is not that difficult to detect but typically the attackers will wrap some sort of exploit around the application,"" said Mr Monrad. ""Even with patches the victim will still be vulnerable so long as there is a hole in the operating system."" Mr Monrad recommended that computer users be careful of clicking on suspicious links or downloading dubious email attachments. Cam scams The criminal market for webcam hacking tools is highly active, according to Mr Monrad, since malicious hackers are often able to exploit their victims after taking covert images of them.  There have also been cases in which hackers sold access to specific cameras. Connected security cameras in buildings may be at risk too, though there are sometimes difficulties in publicly discussing how secure they are. One researcher recently cancelled a forthcoming talk on the issue following legal pressure from the manufacturers of widely-used surveillance cameras. Gianni Gnesa was due to discuss ""vulnerabilities found on major surveillance cameras and show how an attacker could used them to stay undetected"" at the HITB GSEC security conference in Singapore. The Register reports  that a legal threat from one, unnamed, manufacturer resulted in Gnesa withdrawing his presentation.

The Texas-based company - which provides computer network management tools to a wide variety of clients - recently disclosed one of its leading products had been compromised. The watchdog reminded those holding data on UK citizens they had  72 hours to report a breach once discovered . Officials continue to study the impact. Last week, a security source told the BBC that the investigators believed  only a small number of British organisations had been affected  and none were in the public sector. However, since then it has been reported that  the accountants Deloitte, chip-makers Intel and Nvidia, and cloud-computing software maker VMWare  are all among those who have used the Orion network monitoring tool that was altered to provide the hackers a backdoor. There are also indications that the  US Treasury and departments of homeland security, state, defence and commerce were also targeted  via the breach, which has been dubbed ""Sunburst"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Attorney General Bill Barr have both accused Russia of being responsible, as have several cyber-security experts. However, President Donald Trump has muddied the waters by suggesting China could be behind the attack. Both the Kremlin and the Chinese government have denied involvement. SolarWinds published its own guidance to its clients on its website  last week, however the whole site now appears to be offline. Holding to account SolarWinds has said that it believes ""fewer than 18,000"" of its customers had installed the compromised Orion updates. Bruce Schneier, a leading cyber-security researcher, has  written in the Guardian  that ""it's hard to overstate how bad this is"". It will take years to learn which networks the SVR [Russian espionage agency] has penetrated, and where it still has access."" But he noted that the US National Security Agency (NSA) was probably running similar offensive operations of its own on the same scale. Even so, President-elect Joe Biden has promised the US will respond in turn, and mentioned suspicions that Russia was to blame. image copyright Reuters image caption President-elect Joe Biden has said the US will respond to the SolarWinds attack ""We can't let this go unanswered. That means making clear and publicly who is responsible for the attack and taking meaningful steps to hold them in account,""  he said in a speech on Tuesday . Mr Biden also noted that the Department of Defense had refused to brief him on ""many things"" including the attack. UK assessing impact of major hacking campaign Russia behind major cyber-attack, says Pompeo SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters  Second backdoor The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has also urged organisations to take steps to protect their networks. ""This is a complex, global cyber-incident,"" said its director of operations, Paul Chichester. ""But simply having SolarWinds does not automatically make an organisation vulnerable to real-world impact."" To further complicate matters, Microsoft has said its own inquiry into the breach has uncovered a further problem. ""In an interesting turn of events, the investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor,""  it said in a blog published on Friday . It added that that the malicious code provided the perpetrator the means to install and run their own software on a target's machines. Microsoft did not speculate as to whom this second attacker might be or how they might have exploited the hack.

It is thought to be the first large-scale attack on Apple's App Store. The hackers created a counterfeit version of Apple's software for building iOS apps, which they persuaded developers to download.  Apps compiled using the tool allow the attackers to steal data about users and send it to servers they control. Cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks - which has analysed the malware dubbed XcodeGhost - said the perpetrators would also be able to send fake alerts to infected devices to trick their owners into revealing information. It added they could also read and alter information in compromised devices' clipboards, which would potentially allow them to see logins copied to and from password management tools. image copyright Tencent image caption WeChat is one of China's most popular chat apps, and is also used outside the country to a lesser extent Infected applications includes Tencent's hugely popular WeChat app, NetEase's music downloading app and Didi Kuaidi's Uber-like car hailing app.  Some of the affected apps - including the business card scanner CamCard - are also available outside China. ""We've removed the apps from the App Store that we know have been created with this counterfeit software,"" said Apple spokeswoman Christine Monaghan. ""We are working with the developers to make sure they're using the proper version of Xcode to rebuild their apps,"" said Christine Monaghan.  On its  official WeChat blog , Tencent said the security issue affected an older version of its app - WeChat 6.2.5 - and that newer versions were not affected. It added that an initial investigation showed that no data theft or leakage of user information had occurred. Analysis: Dave Lee, North America technology reporter image copyright Apple In Apple's walled garden App Store, this sort of thing shouldn't happen.  The company goes to great lengths, and great expense, to sift through each and every submission to the store. Staff check for quality, usability and, above all else, security.  The Apple App Store is generally considered a safe haven as the barrier to entry is high - there's only been a handful of instances of malware found on iOS apps, compared to Google's Play store which for a while was regarded as something of a ""Wild West"" for apps (until they introduced their own malware-scanning system too). It makes this attack all the more surprising, as it looks like two groups of supposedly informed people have been caught out.  Firstly developers, who security researchers say were duped into using counterfeit software to build their apps, creating the right conditions for the malware to be applied.   And secondly, Apple's quality testers, who generally do a very good job in keeping out nasties, but in this case couldn't detect the threat.  Follow Dave Lee on Twitter  @DaveLeeBBC Developers targeted The malware was initially flagged by researchers at the Chinese e-commerce firm Alibaba. It discovered that the hackers had uploaded several altered versions of Xcode - a tool used to build iOS apps - to a Chinese cloud storage service. Then, about six months ago, the attackers posted links to the software on several forums commonly visited by Chinese developers. image copyright Palo Alto Networks image caption Links to the infected version of Xcode showed up in search engines ""In China - and in other places around the world - sometimes network speeds are very slow when downloading large files from Apple's servers,"" explained Palo Alto Networks in a follow-up blog. ""As the standard Xcode installer is nearly three gigabytes, some Chinese developers choose to download the package from other sources."" It added that potentially hundreds of millions of users might have been affected. Apple does have a security tool - called Gatekeeper - that is designed to alert users to unauthorised Mac programs and stop them from being run. However, it appears the developers must disabled the facility, allowing them to create iOS apps with XcodeGhost. Sense of security Despite the many news headlines about the breach, one expert said he did not forecast a major impact on the sale of Apple products. image copyright INTSIG Information image caption The business card scanning app Camcard is reported to have been one of the products affected ""It is definitely embarrassing for Apple but the reality is that malware is a persistent problem since the days of PCs and the problem will multiply as the number of mobile devices explodes from 1.4 billion units in 2015 to 1.8 billion in 2020,"" Wee Teck Loo, head of consumer electronics at market research firm Euromonitor International, told the BBC. In fact, consumers are less cautious on mobile devices than on PCs, he added. ""In emerging markets like China or Vietnam, mobile devices are their first connected product and security is taken for granted,"" he said. ""Consumers in emerging markets are also less protective of privacy and security issues.""

Research by security company Blue Coat suggests web adverts have overtaken pornography as the most common way for users to encounter a malware threat. On one in five occasions when a mobile user comes into contact with malware, it is via an online advert. Mobile malware is growing, but accounts for just 1% of all malware threats, networking company Cisco says. Although web adverts have replaced pornography as the most common way for users to encounter malware, attacks from X-rated sites are still the most effective. Less than 1% of all requested content on a mobile is for pornography, yet it is responsible for 16% of malware attacks. 'Malicious sites' ""While users don't access pornography that frequently, when they do, they are very vulnerable to malware,"" said the report. In comparison, Blue Coat say, adverts make up 12% of requested content but are responsible for nearly 20% of attacks. The adverts are often displayed through ""legitimate ad networks"" but contain ""malicious code"" or direct users to ""malicious sites"". The report states that the threat of malware  from web ads has increased almost three times since it last looked at data relating to the trend in 2012. Cisco's 2014 Annual Security Report  noted that although mobile malware was ""not a significant percentage"" of web malware encounters ""it is still worth noting because mobile malware is clearly an emerging area of exploration for malware developers"". It also found that when mobile malware is intended to compromise a device, it is nearly always targeted at Android devices. But when mobile malware is not specifically designed to target certain types of devices, then 70% of the attacks were experienced by Android devices and 14% by Apple iPhone users. Blue Coat recommended that mobile users considered blocking web ads on their devices to prevent them becoming victims of a malware attack. Ad-blocking apps exist for both Android and Apple devices and browser settings can be adjusted to prevent ad pop-ups.

The plug-in is installed on many PCs to let them to run small programs written in the Java programming language. Its distributor Oracle has agreed to issue an alert on both social media and its own site following an investigation by the US's Federal Trade Commission. By doing so it has avoided the risk of being fined. However, the firm has not formally admitted to any wrongdoing. Malware target According to  the FTC's complaint , Oracle was aware of security issues in the Java SE (standard edition) plug-in when it bought the technology's creator Sun in 2010. ""The security issues allowed hackers to craft malware that could allow access to consumers' usernames and passwords for financial accounts, and allow hackers to acquire other sensitive information,"" the FTC said.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The FTC settled the case without imposing a fine on Oracle The regulator alleged that Oracle had promised consumers that installing its updates would ensure their PCs would be ""safe and secure"". But it said the firm had failed to acknowledge that a risk remained. This was because Sun's original update process did not delete earlier versions of its software, which hackers could exploit to carry out their attacks. When Oracle initially tried to address this, its update tool only removed the most recent prior version of Java, leaving earlier editions behind. It was not until August 2014 that the company finally rectified the problem. Oracle could not plead ignorance because the FTC had obtained internal documents dated from 2011 that stated ""[the] Java update mechanism is not aggressive enough or simply not working"". According to the watchdog, Java SE is installed on more than 850 million computers.  Because many of those will still not have installed the latest versions of the plug-in, the warning still serves a purpose and provides a link that can be used to detect and uninstall the code. image copyright Getty Images image caption Oracle acquired Java as part of its takeover of Sun in 2010 Junking Java Java is still used to power some web browser-based games, calculator, chat tools and other functions. However, one expert said most users should take this opportunity to trash it.

""There are times in some businesses where they may be internal applications that require Java in the web browser, so you won't have much option, but our recommendation for others is to remove it and stop using it."" Mr Ferguson added that the ruling sent out a message to other software providers that the FTC was concerned about update procedures and might not settle future cases without imposing a financial penalty.

malware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-28145401|"Boleto malware may lose Brazil $3.75bn Published 3 July 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption Hackers may have pocketed $3.75 Billion Researchers from an American security company have unearthed a substantial malware-based fraud ring. The operation has infiltrated one of Brazil's most popular payment methods, Boleto, for two years. An estimated 495,753 Boleto transactions have been compromised, which means the hackers could have stolen up to $3.75bn (Â£2.18bn). Researchers say it is not known whether the fraudsters were successful in collecting on all of the transactions. Boleto Bancario allows an individual to pay an exact amount to a merchant and can be used for almost every kind of transaction, from the weekly shop to phone bills. Boletos can be used and generated both online for electric transfers and offline with printed paper. The attack has been described by US-based security company  RSA , a division of data storage corporation  EMC , as ""a major fraud operation and a serious cybercrime threat to banks, merchants and banking customers in Brazil"". It is not clear how much has been stolen or whether all the funds were successfully redirected to fraudster-controlled bank accounts. However, this will have been the largest electronic theft in history if even half of the valued worth turns out to be in the hands of criminals, according to the  New York Times . The number of infected PCs totals 192,227 - an additional 83,506 email user credentials have also been stolen. Known colloquially as a man-in-the-browser threat, the malware silently injects itself into users' web browsers after hackers have initially tricked individuals into clicking malicious links in seemingly ordinary looking emails. This is similar in principle to  phishing  scams. Once the malware is in the browser, fraudsters can begin to intercept and alter Boleto details. This activity is invisible to the user. ""Because of its stealth capabilities, end-users also have little chance of detecting Boleto fraud on their own,"" said RSA researchers. Google's Chrome, Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Internet Explorer are all vulnerable to the attack. 'A serious impact' ""Brazil has long been a hotbed of cybercrime, and although we don't know exactly what financial impact may have been caused by this sophisticated attack it's possible that different factors might have helped the hackers get away with it,"" said computer security analyst  Graham Cluley . ""Sadly Brazilian computers aren't always necessarily running the very latest anti-virus software, and because Boletos aren't used outside of Brazil it might have made security companies less vigilant about the threat."" Boletos are the second most popular payment method in Brazil, responsible for an estimated 18% of all purchases during 2012. ""Such attacks will have a serious impact on the confidence we place in increasingly common digital payment methods,"" warned Dr Andrew Rogoyski, chair of techUK cyber-security group. Mr Cluley advises users to ""be cautious about opening unsolicited email attachments or clicking on unknown links, and keep your computer updated with security patches and the latest anti-virus"".

The Beijing Bureau of public security announced the arrest of suspects charged with spreading the WireLurker malware. The bug was one of the first pieces of malware to penetrate iPhone's strict software controls. It mainly infected devices in China. The suspects - named only as Chen, Lee and Wang - were arrested in the Beijing area,  according to the statement posted on Chinese social network Sina Weibo. The Chinese authorities also shut down the site that had been spreading the malware. The malware was installed via software downloaded to Mac desktops from the Maiyadi app store. It was then able to attack iOS devices connected to an infected Mac via a USB cable. If a handset was jailbroken - a process used by some to remove Apple's restrictions - WireLurker backed up the device's apps to the Mac, where it repackaged them with malware, and then installed the infected versions back on to the iOS machine. But, according to security experts, the malware was also able to infect non-jailbroken iOS devices. It did so by taking advantage of a technique created by Apple to allow businesses to install special software on their staff's handsets and tablets. This process has since been changed by Apple. By the time WireLurker had been discovered, infected Mac apps had already been downloaded more than 300,000 times. Apple took steps to block the infected apps and reminded users not to install software from third-party app stores. A Windows version of the malware was also found.

The UK's National Crime Agency (NCA) confirmed the arrest after it was reported that raids took place in five European countries and the US. DroidJack allows criminals to spy on smartphone data traffic, eavesdrop on conversations and hijack the camera. No further arrests have yet been reported. ""I can confirm that the NCA arrested a 28-year-old male from Carlisle under suspicion of computer misuse act offences,"" an NCA spokesman told the BBC. The spokesman said the arrest was made in connection with the international DroidJack operation and added that the suspect has been bailed for six months. Officers in the UK, Germany, France, Belgium and Switzerland raided several properties connected to suspected users of malware known as DroidJack. The searches were reported by the AFP and Reuters news agencies while Europol also say that raids were conducted in the United States. A total of 13 homes were raided in Germany according to the local prosecutor's office, while news agencies also reported a single raid in Switzerland.  The German suspects were aged between 19 and 51.  'Every move' tracked DroidJack is a remote access trojan or ""Rat"", which is openly sold online for $210 (Â£137), and affects Android devices only. ""It can track a user's every move without their knowledge,"" explained Peter Coogan, principal security response manager at Symantec. ""There was  a documented case back in 2014 , I think, where it was being sent out via spam email and pretending to be a bank. It is likely at that time that they were trying to steal banking details off the phone,"" he told the BBC. Mr Coogan added that he has tracked discussion of the malware on underground hacking forums where DroidJack has been marketed.

The FBI-co-ordinated operation targeted BlackShades software which can remotely control computers and webcams. The ""malware"" was said to have infected more than 500,000 computers since 2010. The UK's National Crime Agency said 15 arrests took place in England and two men were held in Scotland. Eighty others were held in 15 countries including the US, France and Germany. The NCA said the inquiry focused on the developers and ""prolific users"" of BlackShades. It said investigators believe about 200,000 usernames and passwords of victims across the world may have been taken by UK users of BlackShades.  The software typically infects computers when people click on external links on social networking sites and in emails that purport to lead to pictures, videos or other items of interest, said the NCA. Once installed, criminals can use the software to capture personal information, or take photographs of computer users - which may be used to blackmail them. BlackShades also allows users to take control of a computer secretly and encrypt its data, which is only released on payment of a ransom.  'Invasiveness breathtaking' The worldwide operation is reported to have come after the FBI arrested two BlackShades developers and obtained a list of the malware's customers. The software was advertised on forums for computer hackers and copies were available for sale for about $40 (Â£23) each on a website maintained by Blackshades, US officials said. The FBI said BlackShades has been bought by several thousand people since it was created in 2010, generating sales of more than $350,000 (Â£208,000).  US officials said more than 500,000 computers in more than 100 countries had been infected by BlackShades.  Security experts have also linked the program to attacks on Syrian dissidents in 2012 and attempts to steal data from more than a dozen French organisations.  Details of the raids were outlined at a press conference by Preet Bharara, US Attorney for the Southern District of New York, who  announced charges against five men . He described BlackShades as a ""frightening form of cybercrime"" saying the program's capabilities were ""sophisticated and its invasiveness breathtaking"".  Blackshades ""enabled anyone anywhere in the world to instantly become a dangerous cyber-criminal able to steal your property and invade your privacy,"" he said. The malware could also be used to bring down websites and send out ""ransom notes"" to extort cash after telling a user they had lost control of their  computer, he added. The Association of Chief Police Officer's lead on e-crime, Deputy Chief Constable Peter Goodman, said the operation ""sends out a clear message to cyber criminals that we have the technology, capability and expertise to track them down"". The NCA said its officers were also to warn people who had downloaded the malware but not deployed it that they were now known to the agency.  In total more than 300 properties were searched across the world and 1,000 data storage devices seized. The arrests in the UK took place in Derbyshire; Birmingham; Halesowen; Wolverhampton; Newcastle-under-Lyme; Brixham, Devon; Andover, Hampshire; Ashford, Kent; Liverpool; Manchester; Warrington; London; St Andrews; Glasgow, and Leeds. Further arrests abroad took place in Moldova, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, Finland, Austria, Estonia, Denmark, Canada, Chile, Croatia and Italy.

Malware makers are tailoring their creations to make the most of conditions in each territory, said the report by mobile security firm Lookout. In some places such as Russia, Android users were far more likely to encounter malicious code, it said.  The report comes as analysis of apps on Google's Play store shows a steep rise in the number of malicious programs. ""When it comes to mobile malware, everything is now regionalised,"" said Marc Rogers, Lookout's principal security researcher. Gone were the days when the hi-tech thieves spammed their creations out to everyone, he said. Now malware varied by region as it was adapted to the different conditions in those places.  'Hostile' environment In Europe, wider use of security software on smartphones and action by industry groups against some types of fraudulent activity had forced a reaction from the malware makers. ""Most of Europe is now a hostile environment for premium-rate malware,"" said Mr Rogers. ""You can do it, but it is very difficult to monetise."" Instead, he said, Europe was seeing a rise in so-called chargeware that tries to trick people into paying for a service or app. Pornographic apps were the biggest users of this tactic, he said. Similarly, the US had seen less use of premium-rate scams in favour of apps that steal data, such as login information for online banking systems. However, Mr Rogers said premium-rate malware was still very prevalent in Russia where many people got their apps from unofficial sites rather than Google's Play store, putting the country ahead of the world in terms of the percentage of Android users who were likely to encounter malicious apps of all sorts, he said.  The ""encounter rate"" for the average Russian Android user was 68%, he said. By contrast, encounter rates in the US and Europe were about 4%.  Lookout's report, based on stats using feedback from its 50 million users, comes as another security company, RiskIQ, said it had seen a huge rise in the number of malicious programs appearing on Google's Play store.  In 2011 about 10,000 of the 400,000 apps on the Play store were malicious in one way or another. In 2013 the total number of apps hit one million and RiskIQ said 42,000 of these could be classed as malicious.

Malicious code sought to exploit vulnerabilities in users' systems and install malware, researchers found. If installed, that malware could give hackers control of users' computers, said one security consultant. A spokesman for the Jamie Oliver Group played down the seriousness of the problem and told the BBC that it had been fixed. According to Malwarebytes , unknown hackers either broke into Mr Oliver's site and placed malicious code there, or exploited existing code. The script would direct unsuspecting users to a Wordpress site that hosted yet more malicious code. That would then run an exploit kit that would seek to find vulnerabilities in any user's system and install malware called Dorkbot. 'Tricked' Online security consultant Graham Cluley said the hackers could then gain control of a user's system and direct fake searches. ""In other words, you may think you're googling but, in fact, you are being redirected against your will to search results that earn the attackers affiliate cash,"" he told the BBC. ""In addition, you may find that you are tricked into installing bogus security updates on your computer or told to ring what is claimed to be technical support - although you would actually be speaking to scammers after your credit card details."" image copyright Getty Images image caption The website team was said to be trying to work out when the hackers changed the code on the site According to a spokesman for Jamie Oliver, only 10 users had written to the site about the issue in the past couple of days. He said that a ""low-level malware problem"" was identified and dealt with and that the site was now ""safe to use"". The spokesman added: ""The Jamie Oliver website is regularly checked for vulnerabilities by both our in-house team and an independent third party, and they quickly deal with anything that is found.  ""The team is confident that no data has been compromised in this incident, but if anyone is worried do please use the contact form on the site. ""We apologise to anyone who was at all worried after going on the site."" The spokesman confirmed that existing code on the site was modified by a hacker, but said the website team was still trying to work out when that had happened. 'Serious' The celebrity chef's site has 10 million visitors per month and is ranked 515th in Britain, according to an analyst. Mr Cluley said that its sheer popularity made the problem ""serious"". He said: ""Users would hope that there was tight security in place on the website to prevent this kind of attack from happening - but it appears that things went badly wrong on this occasion."" Jerome Segura, of Malwarebytes, uncovered the issue. He said that, during tests, the malware sought to exploit Adobe Flash, Microsoft Silverlight and Oracle Java. Mr Cluley advised users to run up-to-date antivirus software and the latest patches to secure applications. He added that users should avoid running their computers with admin privileges, ""as this is more attractive for attackers"".

He is suspected of being the man behind the alias Paunch - the nickname used by the creator of the Blackhole and Cool exploit kits, sold to cybercriminals to infect web users with malware. The Russian authorities have not confirmed the details. But security firms said they had already detected a decline in the programs' use. A spokesman for the law enforcement agency Europol told the BBC: ""Europol and the European Cybercrime Centre has been informed that a high-level suspected cyber criminal has been arrested.  ""We can only refer you to the Russian authorities, they are the ones who should speak about this topic."" The Russian police's press office said it had nothing to add at this time. However, Alexander Gostev, chief security expert at the Moscow-based internet protection provider Kaspersky Lab, said the arrest had been confirmed to him by ""anonymous sources"". Spreading malware The Blackhole kit, released in 2010, dominated the crimeware market throughout 2012 and the start of 2013, according to Fraser Howard, a researcher at the anti-virus company Sophos. He said the code had been sold for an annual licence of $1,500 (Â£940) or could be rented from its creator for $200 (Â£125) for one week's use, among other price plans. The software targeted a range of vulnerabilities in the Java programming language, Adobe's Flash media player, Windows software and PDF files. It had two ways of doing this: adding malicious code to hundreds of thousands of legitimate websites, which then copied malware to visitors computers creating links in spam messages to specially created sites that infected PCs image caption Sophos said that Blackhole was used to send links that directed users to sites that downloaded malware Among the malware downloaded was: fake anti-virus software that falsely claimed the PC was infected and urged the user to pay a fee to remove viruses Trojans that attempted to steal financial records stored on the PC the ZeroAccess rootkit, which downloaded other software that hijacked the PC for use in a botnet - a facility used to overwhelm websites with traffic and force them offline key loggers that took a record of what was typed on the PC ransomware that attempted to blackmail the PC owner Although Mr Howard said Blackhole was once the biggest threat of its kind, he added that in recent months it had been overshadowed by rival kits, including Sweet Orange and Neutrino. According to the researcher, the Blackhole and Cool kits put together were only involved in about 4% of all malware detected by Sophos in August, down from 28% the previous year.  The figure had since dropped to 2% in recent days, he added. Another independent security blogger stressed that the arrest was still significant. ""If it's true that the brains behind the Blackhole has been apprehended it's a very big deal - a real coup for the cybercrime-fighting authorities, and hopefully cause disruption to the development of one of the most notorious exploit kits the web has ever seen,""  said Graham Cluley . ""However, it's worth remembering that nature abhors a vacuum, and there would surely be other online criminals waiting to take their place, promoting their alternative exploit kits and malicious code."" Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer at F-Secure, agreed. ""If indeed it is Paunch that they arrested, that is a major arrest - he is a big deal,"" he told the BBC. ""He was clearly the biggest player in providing exploit kits - not just by selling them, but also renting and leasing them to online criminals. ""Both Blackhole and its successor Cool have been very popular.

Yahoo confirmed that for a four-day period in January, malware was served in ads on its homepage. Experts estimate that as many as two million European users could have been hit. Security firm Light Cyber said the malware was intended to create a huge network of Bitcoin mining machines. ""The malware writers put a lot of effort into making it as efficient as possible to utilise the computing power in the best way,"" Light Cyber's founder Giora Engel told the BBC. Lucrative market Bitcoin mining malware is designed to steal computing power to make it easier for criminals to accumulate the virtual currency with little effort on their part. ""Generating bitcoins is basically guessing numbers,"" said Amichai Shulman, chief technology office of security firm Imperva. ""The first one to guess the right number gets 25 bitcoins and if you have a large volume of computers guessing in a co-ordinated way then you have a more efficient way of making money,"" he added. Other than a computer running slower, victims will be unaware that their machine is being used in what could become known as a ""bitnet"". It is a variation on the traditional botnet, networks of malware-infected computers used to churn out spam or bombard websites with requests in order to knock them offline.

The Dexter code  was linked  to a series of attacks on point-of-sale systems in the UK, US and dozens of other countries towards the end of last year. It skims and transmits the cards' magnetic-strip information, allowing clones to be made that can then be used for fraudulent purchases,. Pasa said it believed the criminals responsible were based in Europe, but added it was not sure from which countries. Copied magstrips ""It's probably the worst [attack] of its kind in terms of the losses,"" Walter Volker, Pasa's chief executive, told the BBC. ""We started detecting higher levels of fraud at some of these retailers early in the year - from about late-January, February. We initially thought it was a normal seasonal thing, but as the volumes increased we decided to appoint a forensics investigation company. ""Eventually it was able to find this particular malware in some of the locations. Very soon after we found the cause of the compromise, we were able to clean up those sites with anti-malware software."" image caption KFC restaurants were among those to have been targeted Mr Volker added that while the attack had targeted back-end systems to steal data from the cards' magstrips, it had not stolen Pin codes or CVV payment authentication numbers - meaning the thieves would not have been able to withdraw money from bank cash machines or have used the information to make purchases from internet shops. ""Normal anti-virus software would probably have cleaned up Dexter but it was a particular custom-built variant, which was not detectable with the normal scanning software that everybody's got,"" Mr Volker added. ""It seems like it was a European-based syndicate - we don't exactly where - but Interpol and Europol are making good progress in trying to apprehend these particular perpetrators."" KFC fast-food restaurants' card systems were among those to have been compromised, according to a statement given by the chain's owner to the  Bloomberg news agency . ""We take this extremely seriously,"" Yum Brands said. ""Our first priority is to make sure that the impact on our customers remains minimal."" Bloomberg added that a locally based burger and pizza chain operator, Famous Brands, had also confirmed some of its payment machines had been exposed. However, Pasa stressed that it would ultimately be the banks - rather than the public or other businesses - that would face losses as a consequence of the attack. ""In terms of the banks, there's probably not a single issuing bank in the country that has not been affected in some way,"" said Mr Volker. ""The South African card holders - or potentially tourists using their cards at the affected sites - will not be exposed to any losses. It's just the inconvenience of detecting false transactions on their accounts. ""If that has happened they should just contact their issuing bank.""

Mask was uncovered by Kaspersky Labs and the code is thought to have been targeting victims for seven years. The software is among the ""most advanced threats"" the company has ever seen, it  said in a lengthy analysis . The web-wide activities of Mask stopped last week soon after Kaspersky revealed its existence. Language link Kaspersky said Mask had hit targets in 31 countries and infected more than 380 separate organisations and businesses.  It used a variety of techniques to compromise machines and, in some cases, its creators seem to have bought undocumented vulnerabilities in software in order to penetrate some targets.  Different versions of Mask were prepared by its creators so no matter what operating system people used, be it Windows, Apple iOS or Linux, they were vulnerable. Kaspersky said it also suspected that versions of Mask were available that could attack Android or Apple smartphones. The software gets its name from the regular appearance of the Spanish word for mask (Careto) in its core code. Other hints in the code suggest it originated in a Spanish-speaking nation. Kaspersky said it suspected Mask was created by a nation state to help it spy but declined to speculate about which country was behind it.  Top of the target list were organisations in Morocco but institutions and companies in Brazil, the UK, France and Spain and many other nations were also caught out.  As well as governments and private equity firms, other victims included embassies, oil and gas companies, activist groups and research labs. Once it managed to infect a system, the virus stole documents, encryption keys, private network credentials and remote access information.  Soon after Kaspersky uncovered Mask it took action with other computer firms to shut 90 of the command-and-control systems keeping it running.  So far, said Symantec security researcher Liam O'Murchu, it was not clear who was behind Mask or what they were after.  ""Just looking at the targets, it is not obvious who would want to target them; there is no obvious pattern,"" he told Reuters.  ""The code is professionally written, but it's even difficult to say whether is it written by a government or by a private company that sells this type of software.""

Public information website Public Intelligence  published the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Bureau of Investigation memo  to US police and emergency medical personnel. Nokia's Symbian system, on the Finnish company's basic-feature handsets, had had the second-most malware attacks. Apple's iOS had had 0.7% of attacks. Android is the world's most popular mobile operating system, and the memo blamed its high share of attacks on its ""market share and open-source architecture"". Text trojans - malware that sends SMS messages to premium-rate numbers without the phone owners' knowledge - accounted for half of the Android attacks on old versions of the system.  The memo also cited fake sites that appeared to be like Google's Play marketplace and ""rootkits"" that allowed hackers to track a user's keystrokes and passwords. It said 44% of Android users were still using older versions of the operating system - specifically 2.3.3 through 2.3.7, dubbed Gingerbread and released in 2011. These have a ""number of security vulnerabilities that were fixed in later versions"", the memo added.  ""The growing use of mobile devices by federal, state, and local authorities makes it more important than ever to keep mobile OS patched and up-to-date,"" it said. 'Master key' exploit Apple has said that more than 93% of the 600 million iPhones and iPads sold run  iOS 6, the latest version of the operating system.  The next version is expected to be released to the public next month. This is the not the first time the open nature of Google's popular phone software has been questioned.  Security firm Symantec noted last month that a ""master key"" bug - which allows attackers to take control of Android phones - was being exploited in China.

The attacks were first revealed  by Reuters , identifying breaches at the Treasury and homeland security, the department which manages cyber-security for the US government. Parts of the defence department were also breached,  the New York Times reports , while the Washington Post says that the state department and National Institutes of Health were hacked. The UK's intelligence agency GCHQ is currently monitoring the situation and has described the compromises as ""serious events"". A number of UK government departments and other organisations use SolarWinds but its unclear if they use Orion. The list of identified victims is expected to grow as more information about the incident emerges. media caption Obama's former director of cyber security warns Radio 4's Today Russia election hacking is like 'playbook' What happened? SolarWinds Orion's software allows IT staff to remotely access computers on corporate networks. In a so-called ""supply-chain attack"", hackers gained access to SolarWinds Orion and then had access to all of its customers' networks. FireEye, a company that provides US government cyber-security, identified the large-scale campaign after  it fell victim to the hackers in a separate attack . The actors manipulated SolarWinds Orion's software updates to include malware which, once installed, allowed the hackers to monitor its customers' systems, Fireye said. ""We have been advised this attack was likely conducted by an outside nation state and intended to be a narrow, extremely targeted, and manually executed attack, as opposed to a broad, system-wide attack,"" SolarWinds said in a statement on its website. It urged all users of its Orion platform to update their software immediately for security. FireEye hack FireEye's own hacking tools, which are used to carry out fake attacks on its customers, were stolen by the same actors, it said. By mimicking the behaviour of hackers, it uses these programmes to investigate the security of different organisations and offer advice on how to protect vulnerabilities. Since the discovery, there is evidence that these tools have already been used in 19 countries including the US, UK and Ireland, Raj Samani, chief scientist at leading cyber-security firm McAfee said.

View original tweet on Twitter FireEye has  now released  more than 300 countermeasures to detect the use of its stolen tools and to minimise the potential impact if they are used. When the experts investigating a cyber-attack downgrade their estimate of the number of people affected, it's normally a good thing. So when SolarWinds says the number of organisations that could have been spied upon through its products is not the 300,000 initially feared, you'd think it would be cause for slight consolation. Unfortunately, this is almost completely irrelevant. Like all cyber-attacks, it's not about the quantity of victims but their quality. You don't get much higher quality targets than US government departments. The other key number in this hack is eight. That's how many months it's thought the hackers had access to SolarWinds and could have started to snoop, poke around or steal sensitive material from their customers. The thing we don't know, and may never know, is what the quality of the information stolen is. It's unlikely that top-level government communications would have been breached - those are likely to be heavily encrypted and sent on separate systems. But like any offices, sometimes important operational documents, snippets of information or even the digital keys to other parts of a business are left lying around in places they shouldn't be. The investigation into this hack will be months long and its consequences could take years to be realised.

The network call Necurs infected over nine million computers and one of the world's largest botnets. Necurs was responsible for multiple criminal scams including stealing personal information and sending fake pharmaceutical emails. Cyber-criminals use botnets to remotely take over internet-connected devices and install malicious software.  The software can be used to send spam, collect information about what activity the computer is used for or delete information without notifying the owner. Tom Burt, Microsoft's vice-president for customer security and trust, said in a blog post that the takedown of Necurs was the result of eight years of planning and co-ordination with partners in 35 countries. He wrote that the steps taken will ""ensure the criminals behind this network are no longer able to use key elements of its infrastructure to execute cyber-attacks."" What is a botnet? Botnets are networks of internet-connected devices that run automated tasks. Cyber-criminals use these networks to send malicious software, called malware, which can give them remote access to a computer. Once that malware is in place these criminals can take information from the computer or use the infected devices to send more attacks or spam. Once a device has been infected, and used to send more spam or malware attacks, it is known as a zombie. How did the takedown work? Necurs first appeared in 2012. It is believed to have had a network of more than nine million zombie computers. To grow this network Necurs used a domain generation algorithm that created random domain names the group turned into websites. It used these sites to send instructions to its army of infected computers.   Microsoft and its partners were able to crack Necurs' algorithm and predict what domain names it would be using in the months ahead and block them. Is my computer affected by malware? Necurs was one of the largest malware networks in the world, but it was not alone. Some signs your device may have malware on it Programs begin to operate more slowly or take longer to open The computer regularly crashes and needs to be rebooted Space on a computer's hard drive fills up without warning Spam emails are sent to contacts from your account Malware is a broad term for any malicious software that attacks a computer.

It will use San Francisco-based Lookout's software to scan handsets and tablets for threats. The feature will be targeted at business users as part of the firm's forthcoming Knox security product, which was announced in February. Numerous studies have indicated that many hackers have focused their efforts on Google's Android system. Analysts said the move was designed to reassure companies that Samsung's Android phones were a safe alternative  to the Blackberry  and  Windows Phone platforms  which have promoted their enterprise security facilities as key features. More malware Lookout's chief executive blogged that malware protection had become increasingly important at a time more employees were linking their own devices to office networks. ""One in three companies now allow employees to bring their own devices to work, and whether or not it's allowed, employees are doing so and company data is being accessed outside of the corporate network, potentially putting that data at risk,""  wrote John Hering . The company said its servers would scan Samsung's mobile devices against known malware that could be introduced via email attachments, webpages or file-sharing services. Other anti-virus firms have also been quick to play up the threat to Android devices. image caption Lookout says its software will protect Galaxy device owners against known types of malware Kaspersky recently announced that it had detected 57,000 new examples of malware specifically targeting the operating system since the start of the year.  McAfee has also warned that  new types of spyware  and code designed to bypass bank ID protection had helped swell the amount of Android malware by 35% in the April-to-June quarter. The US government has also  issued its own alert  suggesting 79% of all malware threats to mobile operating systems were directed at Android in 2012. ""Android is the most insecure mobile system of all the mobile ones, and that's been made more difficult because it's so fragmented,"" said Richard Absalom, an analyst at telecoms consultancy Ovum. ""It's not just that that people are still running old versions of the software, but that Samsung and other vendors are forking the OS in different ways."" Google itself has taken steps to address the problem. Earlier this month  it banned apps  from its Play store that make changes to a device without the owner's knowledge or consent. But one expert suggested the firm had still not gone far enough. ""New variants of Android malware are found every day, with most designed to steal money from users by signing them up for expensive premium rate SMS scams,"" independent security analyst Graham Cluley told the BBC. ""Much of the Android malware has disguised itself as fake versions of popular apps like Angry Birds or Instagram, and although its normally encountered in unofficial app stores they have also managed to intrude into Google's official Play store on a worrying number of occasions.""

""This approval enables other government agencies and regulated industries such as healthcare and financial services to adopt Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets,"" the South Korean firm said at the time. Ovum suggested the latest announcement would help give the company an edge over other Android manufacturers such as Sony, HTC and LG. ""What Samsung is doing here is seeing a gap in the market,"" said Mr Absalom.

In laboratory tests, the malware altered 70 images and managed to fool three radiologists into believing patients had cancer. The altered images also managed to trick automated screening systems. The team from Israel developed the malicious software  to show how easy it is to get around security protections for diagnostic equipment. The program was able to convincingly add fake malignant growths to images of lungs taken by MRI and CT scanning machines. Glossary: Malware, patches and worms Could hackers 'brainjack' your memories in future? The researchers, from Ben Gurion University's cyber-security centre, said the malware could also remove actual malignant growths from image files to prevent patients who are targets getting the care they need.  The images targeted were scans of lungs but the malware could be tuned to produce other fake conditions such as brain tumours, blood clots, fractures or spinal problems, according to the Washington Post,   which first reported on the research. Images and scans were vulnerable, said the researchers, because the files were generally not digitally signed or encrypted. This means any changes would be hard to spot. The researchers suggested the security flaws could be exploited to sow doubt about the health of government figures, sabotage research, commit insurance fraud or as part of a terrorist attack. In addition, they said, weaknesses in the way hospitals and health care centres protect their networks could give attackers easy access. While hospitals were careful about sharing sensitive data beyond their boundaries, they took much less care when handling data internally, said one of the researchers. ""What happens within the hospital system itself, which no regular person should have access to in general, they tend to be pretty lenient about,"" Yisroel Mirsky told the Washington Post. Better use of encryption and digital signatures could help hospitals avoid problems if cyber-attackers tried to subvert images, he added. Hospitals and other healthcare organisations have been a popular target for cyber-attackers and many have been hit by malicious ransomware that encrypts files and only returns the data when victims pay up. The NHS  was hit hard in 2017 by the WannaCry ransomware  which left many hospitals scrambling to recover data.

Ransomware is the fastest growing form of computer malware, experts warn. It's a malicious virus that locks the user out of their computer and demands a fee to return their files. A report published by the Australian government  claims 72% of businesses surveyed experienced ransomware incidents in 2015. The figure was just 17% in 2013 . It's also a growing threat for mobile devices as it can be hidden in an app, says Gert-Jan Schenk, vice-president at internet security company Lookout. ""For the most part, we've seen ransomware delivered through drive-by downloads - it pretends to be a popular app, increasing the chances that you'll click on it,"" he explains. ""To avoid these threats, users should be very careful about what apps they install, and where they come from - read the reviews on Google Play, and avoid side-loading from untrusted sources."" How does it work? image copyright Thinkstock image caption The ransom is usually demanded in the form of bitcoins Like most computer viruses, ransomware often arrives in the form of a phishing email, or spam, or a fake software update - and the recipient clicks a link or opens an attachment. The virus then sets to work encrypting the user's files. Once the computer is effectively locked down, it demands a fee - often in bitcoins because it is less easy to trace - for the return of the files. The fee is generally one or two bitcoins - the equivalent of about $500 (Â£330). It is less common now, but in the earlier days of the malware - about five years ago - the ransom note could take the form of a law enforcement notice. The user was directed to a web page that appeared to be from, for example, the FBI, falsely claiming illegal images of children had been been found on the machine and a fine was payable. There is generally a time limit to comply, after which the ransom increases. Is there any way to get round it? image copyright Thinkstock image caption Back up, back up, back up... Sometimes it is just a threat, but mostly the virus really does encrypt files. The only way to retrieve your files without paying the ransom is to go to a backed-up version. Neil Douglas, from Edinburgh-based IT company Network Roi, has just helped a small business client whose server was hit by ransomware. ""We had to recover everything from back-up. We'd had a back-up two minutes before the infection, so the timing couldn't have been any better - but it did result in quite a bit of downtime,"" he says. ""You could risk paying them - but it's a bit like paying  a blackmailer. We would only recommend it as a last resort. ""You don't know whether they'll come back for more, you don't know that they'll clear the infection."" Cybersecurity expert Prof Alan Woodward says paying also leaves you vulnerable to further cybercrime. ""As soon as you pay up, you get on a suckers' list and you'll probably get contacted again,"" he says. ""It's low-hanging fruit for the criminals."" Do many people pay? image copyright Thinkstock image caption The official advice is not to pay - but many do While all the expert advice is, of course, not to pay, plenty of people do - even those you would least expect to. Tewksbury Police, in the US, admitted they had paid up when their main server had been attacked and locked down at the end of last year. ""Nobody wants to negotiate with terrorists. Nobody wants to pay terrorists,"" Police Chief Timothy Sheehan  told the town's local paper . ""We did everything we possibly could. ""It was an eye-opening experience, I can tell you right now. It made you feel that you lost control of everything. ""Paying the bitcoin ransom was the last resort."" Ransomware is lucrative for criminals because so many victims pay rather than face the shame of false accusations - or like the police department, they just desperately need their files. ""Some companies have set up bitcoin accounts in case it happens to them,"" says Prof Woodward. ""I would recommend that nobody ever pays up. ""The only way to deal with it is to be sure you have a virus checker and back up."" Who is behind it? image copyright Thinkstock image caption Organised crime gangs use computer viruses to generate money ""It tends to be organised crime,"" says Prof Woodward. ""They do make millions out of it. It's opportunistic... they just try it on everybody. You keep third parties out of it - the bank isn't involved."" Recent research by Palo Alto Networks and industry partners suggested one family of ransomware known as Crypto Wall had generated about $325m (Â£215m) for the gang behind it.  ""In the volume cybercrime space, ransomware is one of the most prolific problems we face,"" Greg Day, chief security officer for Europe at Palo Alto Networks, told the BBC last month. ""Credit card theft is getting to the point where the value of each card is very low.  As a result, ransomware has stepped into that gap and gives a higher value for each victim.""

Evil Corp hackers have tried to access at least 31 organisations' networks in order to cripple systems and demand millions of dollars in ransom. The group's two alleged leaders were indicted by the US Justice Department in December 2019. There are concerns that US voting systems could also be targeted. Last year, US authorities filed charges against Evil Corp's alleged leaders Maksim Yakubets and Igor Turashev, accusing them of using malware to steal millions of dollars from groups including schools and religious organisations in over 40 countries. Officials announced a $5m reward for information leading to their arrest, which they said was the largest amount ever offered for a cyber criminal. Both men are still at large.  image copyright US Department of Justice image caption Maksim Yakubets (L) and Igor Turashev are accused of running Evil Corp The threat comes as the majority of Americans have been working from home due to the coronavirus pandemic -  62%  according to a Gallup poll . The US presidential election is also just months away, and federal and local officials have been working to put measures in place to protect voter records as well as manage safe voting practices amid the pandemic. What do we know about the attack? Symantec Corporation, a firm that monitors corporate and government networks  released a notice warning of the threat  it identified on Thursday night. The attacks used what Symantec described as a relatively new type of ransomware called WastedLocker, which has been attributed to Evil Corp. Ransomware are computer viruses that threaten to delete files unless the ransom is paid. The WastedLocker ransomware virus demands ransoms of $500,000 to $1m to unlock computer files it seizes.  Symantec said the ""vast majority of targets are major corporations, including many household names"", and eight targets were Fortune 500 companies. All are US-owned but one, which is a US-based subsidiary. Most targeted companies were in the manufacturing, information technology and media sectors.  media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Symantec said the hackers had breached the networks of these companies and were ""laying the groundwork"" for future ransomware attacks that would let them block access to data and demand millions of dollars. Symantec technical director Eric Chien  told the New York Times  the hackers take advantage of employees now using virtual private networks (VPNs) to access work systems. They use VPNs to identify which company a user works for, and then infect the user's computer when they visit a public or commercial site. When the user next connects to their employer's system, the hackers can attack. What's the context? There have been a number of recent cyber-attacks on local governments across the US. Cities and towns in Louisiana, Oregon, Maryland, Georgia, Texas and Florida were hit by ransomware attacks last year.  The Department of Homeland Security is looking into safeguarding voter registration databases ahead of November 3's general election. In February, the agency's head of cyber-security  said this was a key election security concern . These attacks by foreign cyber-criminals are far from a new threat. During the impeachment inquiry last year, former White House security adviser and Russia expert Fiona Hill testified that ""Russia's security services and their proxies have geared up to repeat their interference in the 2020 election"". In 2018, the justice department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking Democratic officials in the 2016 US elections, using spear phishing emails and malicious software.  The hackers also stole data on half a million voters from a state election board site. Moscow has said there is no evidence linking the 12 to military intelligence or hacking.

Reports from companies reveal that thousands of pages of paper were wasted when the Windows virus hit their PCs. Security firms said the worst hit were large businesses in the US, India, Europe, and South America. The culprit is a malicious program called Milicenso that has been re-used many times by hi-tech crime groups. In a blogpost analysing the virus, security firm Symantec   said Milicenso was first seen in 2010 and because it was a ""malware delivery vehicle for hire"" had turned up regularly ever since.           Its most recent incarnation was as a tool for distributing French language adware. Symantec said Milicenso could infect a PC by various routes, such as an email attachment, via a compromised website or by posing as a fake video decoder. 'Garbled printouts' Once installed, the virus polls a location on the net and re-directs web traffic so it serves up adverts. Symantec said one side effect of infection was to generate a file in a PC's printer queue. This turns the contents of the files in the virus's main directory into print jobs. ""The garbled printouts appear to be a side effect of the infection vector rather an intentional goal of the author,"" said Symantec.  Victims hit by the virus have reported its effects via discussion forums run by security firms.                           In the worst cases, hundreds of printers   have been generating gibberish and wasting reams of paper.

The official said it was believed a ""malicious"" code was to blame for the system failure. He said investigators were trying to identify and analyse the virus. Last week, North Korea accused the US and its allies of attacks on its internet servers. In the latest incident, two South Korean banks, Shinhan Bank and Nonghyup, and three TV stations KBS, MBS and YTN, all reported that their networks had suddenly shut down on Wednesday afternoon. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Seoul says that, for one of the world's most networked populations, South Korea has had more than its share of cyber attacks.  North Korea has been blamed for several breaches over the past few years, she says. Initially, South Korea's Communications Commission suspected a cyber-attack. However, the BBC was later told that experts had concluded it was not a denial-of-service attack, of the kind South Korea has experienced in the past.  'Skulls' on screens Staff at the three broadcasters said their computers crashed and could not be restarted, with screens simply displaying an error message, although they have continued to make television broadcasts, our correspondent said.  There were also reports of skulls popping up on some computer screens, which could indicate that hackers had installed malicious code in the networks, the Korean Internet Security Agency said.  Some services at Shinhan bank, including internet banking and ATM machines, were also affected, although operations now appear to have been restored. In the immediate aftermath of the incident, South Korean internet service provider LG Uplus said it believed its network had been hacked, Reuters news agency reported. An official from the presidential office told Yonhap news agency it was not yet known whether North Korea was involved. ""We do not rule out the possibility of North Korea being involved, but it's premature to say so,"" Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok said. Hackers can cover their tracks by launching their attacks indirectly by hijacking other people's computer systems, says the BBC's technology correspondent Mark Gregory.  Tracing an attack to its original source can be complex in the extreme, he adds.  image copyright AP image caption Services at two banks were hit by the incident, which began at around 14:00 local time However, in some highly sophisticated attacks, hackers' precise methods have provided clues to their identity.  Slight variations in method have acted as a kind of digital signature, to help investigators trace who they are, our correspondent says. Surveillance upgrade No government-related computer networks were affected, an official from the National Computing and Information Agency (NCIA) told Yonhap.   The military has upgraded its information surveillance status by one level, Yonhap said. North Korea is believed to have been behind two major cyber attacks on the South, in 2009 and 2011, that targeted government agencies and financial firms. Nonghyup bank was one of the victims of the 2011 attack, which left its customers unable to access or transfer their cash for three days. North Korea has stepped up rhetoric in recent days in response to fresh UN sanctions over its nuclear test in February and joint annual military drills between the US and South Korea, which it bitterly opposes. On 15 March, North Korea's KCNA news agency accused the US and its allies of ""intensive and persistent"" hacking attacks on its networks. Official sites such as KCNA, Air Koryo and Rodong Sinmun, the party newspaper, were reportedly inaccessible for short periods.

The attacks come as security experts warn of efforts by malicious hackers to target the oil and energy industry. The attack forced the Qatar-based RasGas firm to shut down its website and email systems.  RasGas, one of the world's largest producers of liquid petroleum gas, said production was not hit by the attack. The company said it spotted the ""unknown virus"" earlier this week and took desktop computers, email and web servers offline as it cleaned up. The report comes only days after Saudi Arabia's Aramco revealed it had completed a clean-up operation after a virus knocked out 30,000 of its computers. The cyber- assault on Aramco also only hit desktop computers rather than operational plant and machinery.  Both attacks come in the wake of alerts issued by security firms about a virus called ""Shamoon"" or ""Disstrack"" that specifically targets companies in the oil and energy sectors. Unlike many other contemporary viruses Shamoon/Disstrack does not attempt to steal data but instead tries to delete it irrecoverably. The virus spreads around internal computer networks by exploiting shared hard drives. Neither RasGas nor Aramco has released details of which virus penetrated its networks.  The vast majority of computer viruses are designed to help cyber-thieves steal credit card numbers, online bank account credentials and other valuable digital assets such as login names and passwords.

Filipino Onel de Guzman, now 44, says he unleashed the Love Bug computer worm to steal passwords so he could access the internet without paying. He claims he never intended it to spread globally. And he says he regrets the damage his code caused. ""I didn't expect it would get to the US and Europe. I was surprised,"" he said in an interview for Crime Dot Com, a forthcoming book on cyber-crime. The Love Bug pandemic began on 4 May, 2000.  Victims received an email attachment entitled LOVE-LETTER-FOR-YOU. It contained malicious code that would overwrite files, steal passwords, and automatically send copies of itself to all contacts in the victim's Microsoft Outlook address book. Within 24 hours, it was causing major problems across the globe, reportedly infecting 45 million machines. It also overwhelmed organisations' email systems, and some IT managers disconnected parts of their infrastructure to prevent infection.  This led to estimates of damage and disruption running into billions of pounds. In the UK, Parliament shut down its email network for several hours to protect itself, and even the Pentagon was reportedly affected. The previous year, the Melissa bug is believed to have infected a million machines using similar tactics. However, Love Bug dwarfed previous outbreaks and exposed how vulnerable the world's increasing internet connectivity was to attack. Investigators traced the virus to an email address registered to an apartment in Manila, capital of the Philippines. The occupant's brother was Onel de Guzman, a computer science student at the city's AMA Computer College. He was a member of an underground hacking group called Grammersoft and quickly became the lead suspect in a police investigation. De Guzman's lawyer organised a press conference on 11 May, at which de Guzman appeared to speak little English.  When asked whether he may have released the virus accidentally, de Guzman said: ""It is possible."" At the time, the Philippines had no law covering computer hacking, and neither de Guzman nor anyone else was ever prosecuted.  Suspicion also fell on de Guzman's fellow student Michael Buen, who has been cited online as the co-author of the Love Bug. I set out to track down Onel de Guzman and resolve the 20-year mystery of Love Bug's origin. Online rumours claimed de Guzman had moved to Germany, Austria or the US. Some claimed he had been recruited by Microsoft following the outbreak. All proved to be wide of the mark. On a forum dedicated to the Philippine underworld, a user claimed in 2016 that de Guzman ran a mobile phone repair shop in the Quiapo district of Manila. In April 2019, I visited the area hoping to encounter the suspect, only to find a sprawling market containing dozens of mobile phone repair shops. I wrote Onel de Guzman's name on a piece of paper and showed it to shop workers at random in the hope that someone would recognise it. Finally an employee said he knew of de Guzman and believed he now worked in another phone repair booth at a shopping mall elsewhere in Manila. After several hours wandering around the mall and showing de Guzman's name, I was directed to a cramped, messy stall at the very back of the building, and after waiting several hours for him to turn up, Onel de Guzman arrived. He admitted having created Love Bug, which he said was a revamped version of an earlier virus he had coded in order to steal internet access passwords.  In the era of dial-up internet, such passwords were needed to get online, and de Guzman says he could not afford to pay for one. He claims he initially sent the virus only to Philippine victims, with whom he communicated in chat rooms, because he only wanted to steal internet access passwords that worked in his local area. However, in spring 2000 he tweaked the code, adding an auto-spreading feature that would send copies of the virus to victims' Outlook contacts, using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows 95 operating system. He also created a title for the email attachment that would have global appeal, tempting people across the world to open it. ""I figured out that many people want a boyfriend, they want each other, they want love, so I called it that,"" he said. image caption Onel de Guzman says he regrets the damage his creation caused De Guzman claims he sent the virus initially to someone in Singapore, and then went out drinking with a friend. The first he knew of the global chaos he had unleashed was when his mother told him police were hunting a hacker in Manila. He explained that his mother hid his computer equipment. De Guzman insists Buen had nothing to do with Love Bug and that he was its sole creator. After a period of lying low, de Guzman returned to computer work but did not go back to college. He now runs the small booth with another member of staff. He says he regrets writing the virus, and the infamy it has brought him. ""Sometimes I get my picture on the internet,"" he said.  ""My friends say, 'It's you!' I'm a shy person, I don't want this.""

Phones have been infected with spam-forwarding software that hid inside free versions of popular Android games.  Once installed, the booby-trapped app contacts a web server for a list of phone numbers then starts sending junk text messages to them. Angry Birds Space, Need for Speed Most Wanted and many other games have been used in the attack. The first stage of the campaign to recruit phones to act as spam relays. It involved sending out thousands of messages supposedly offering people free versions of popular Android games, said network security firm  Cloudmark in an analysis of the SpamSoldier attack . The copies of the games were held on a server in China rather than on the main Google Play store, it said. After the app is downloaded users must disable some safeguards, grant the app permission to install and give it the ability to browse the web or send texts messages before it will run.  Attack spreading Once installed the app removes its icon from a phone's main screen and then contacts a central server for a list of target phone numbers. It then starts sending out spam messages in a bid to trick more people into downloading and installing the rogue app. Other spam messages sent via infected phones falsely told people they had won a gift card. In a separate analysis mobile security firm Lookout said  SpamSoldier worked hard to hide its activity by editing outgoing message logs to hide the junk texts being sent. In addition, it also looks for responses from the numbers it spammed to prevent victims finding out about its presence. So far, said security firms, the number of phones infected remained low but junk texts sent by infected phones were starting to pop up on all US carriers. Cloudmark said whoever was behind the attack had recently ramped up their use of it. Now, it said, it was seeing more than 500,000 junk texts per day being sent through infected Android phones. ""This sort of attack changes the economics of SMS spam, as the spammer no longer has to pay for the messages that are sent,"" said analyst Andrew Conway at Cloudmark. "" Now that we know it can be done, we can expect to see more more complex attacks that are harder to take down."" Ciaran Bradley, head of handset security at Adaptive Mobile, said growing numbers of spammers were adopting this tactic. ""We've also seen the spammers try to spread the infection by advertising free adult videos featuring a well-known reality TV star,"" he said. "". It illustrates the lengths spammers will go to to ensure their messages are delivered and to avoid detection.""

It also displays an image that it claims reveals images of child sexual abuse have been viewed on a computer.  The Windows virus locks a computer and only returns control to its owner on payment of a 100 euro (Â£86) fine. It purports to be collecting cash on behalf of German copyright authorities and the country's national computer security agency. The virus amounted to ""digital extortion"" and victims should not pay up, said German police. The warning about the novel strain of ransomware was issued by Germany's Federal Criminal police office (the Bundeskriminalamt or BKA).  The ransomware version found by the BKA uses a pop-up window that says the machine has been locked down due to ""unauthorised network activity"". The window is crafted to look like it has been put together by Germany's Federal Office for Information Security (BKI) and its society for prosecution of copyright infringement (GVU). 'Emotional blackmail' Text in the window claims that images of child sexual abuse as well as pirated content have been found on the machine. Also displayed is an picture of a child which it claims reveals illegal images have been viewed. Rik Ferguson, director of security research at Trend Micro, said it was the first time he had heard of ransomware displaying images that users were accused of harbouring. ""It seems that they are attempting to increase the pressure of this kind of emotional blackmail,"" he told the BBC.  Germany's BKA said users should not pay the fine ""under any circumstances"" and added that neither the BKI or GVU collected cash in this way from those suspected of viewing illegal images or pirating content. Instead, users should use anti-virus and other security software to clean up their PC and deal with the virus. ""This is a form of digital extortion,"" said the BKA in its alert about the virus. Ransomware, which tries to make victims pay an on-the-spot fine, is becoming more prevalent but most strains simply accuse people of pirating movies or music. Others scramble data that is only unscrambled when a fee is paid. Security firm Symantec said it was seeing more and more strains of ransomware and said it could be ""highly profitable"" for its creators. It estimated that ransomware makers were already making about $5m (Â£3m) a year from such malicious code.

Anyone caught out by the malicious file would give its creators remote access to their computer. The EFF said the attack was the latest in a series aimed at Syrian dissidents. Disastrous consequences In its warning  , the EFF said the malicious program was in a message being sent to people known to be supporters of the rebels in Syria.          Posing as an ""important new video"" the program claims to be able to encrypt and protect calls made by Skype.  However, the EFF said anyone installing the program would be putting in place a remote-access Trojan file designed to snoop on a victim's computer. The malicious program can log keystrokes and take screenshots. In the past, said the EFF, activists have been targeted through YouTube and Facebook and have been subject to a variety of phishing attacks. Analysis of the latest Trojan led the EFF to conclude that it was the work of the same group that was behind earlier attacks.

The pop-up suggested her three-month-old computer was at risk and directed her to update her security settings by downloading a file. Moments later, the mother-of-one's phone rang and a man claiming to be from Windows Support told her the laptop had a virus. ""It was really convincing,"" says the 37-year-old research manager from south London. ""They had my details without me giving my name and address. I asked how they knew I was online and he said they could tell when something had been downloaded. ""He told me it was not performing at full speed and that it could crash at any moment. We were on the phone for an hour while he took me through various files in my hard drive."" Whenever Ms Fawcett began to doubt the caller's authenticity, he would reassure her - at one point asking his supervisor to take over. ""They sounded so professional,"" she said. 'Freaked out' She was then directed to another website and it was explained that for a Â£70 annual fee, her computer could be instantly wiped clean of viruses. ""I was totally freaked out. I didn't hand over any money but it was the thought it could happen."" After Ms Fawcett refused to give her credit card details, the caller finished the conversation by saying she should take time to think about it. However, afterwards, she tried a web search for the name of the website she had been directed to - and got a string of results identifying the site with a type of ""rogue anti-spyware"". A friend has since checked her laptop and says initial indications are that nothing is amiss. However, Ms Fawcett says the experience has left her nervous of using the web, where previously she would have been happy to browse and shop online. ""Even having the laptop back made me anxious. It feels like other people have a window into your home."" Tony Neate, managing director of internet advice service Get Safe Online, said this was a typical tactic of an organised scam. ""If you download some sort of trojan that can take over your computer, it can find registration documents from software you may have signed up for. ""Once they have a name, address and phone number, they can say they have been monitoring your computer."" However, Mr Neate said a firm could only monitor a computer if they have planted a device in it which allows it to do so. To do this without permission would be illegal.

Dr Mark Gasson from the University of Reading had a chip inserted in his hand which was then infected with a virus. The device, which enables him to pass through security doors and activate his mobile phone, is a sophisticated version of ID chips used to tag pets. In trials, Dr Gasson showed that the chip was able to pass on the computer virus to external control systems. If other implanted chips had then connected to the system they too would have been corrupted, he said.  Medical alert Dr Gasson admits that the test is a proof of principle but he thinks it has important implications for a future where medical devices such as pacemakers and cochlear implants become more sophisticated, and risk being contaminated by other human implants.  ""With the benefits of this type of technology come risks. We may improve ourselves in some way but much like the improvements with other technologies, mobile phones for example, they become vulnerable to risks, such as security problems and computer viruses."" He also added: ""Many people with medical implants also consider them to be integrated into their concept of their body, and so in this context it is appropriate to talk in terms of people themselves being infected by computer viruses."" However, Dr Gasson predicts that wider use will be made of implanted technology. ""This type of technology has been commercialised in the United States as a type of medical alert bracelet, so that if you're found unconscious you can be scanned and your medical history brought up.""  Professor Rafael Capurro of the Steinbeis-Transfer-Institute of Information Ethics in Germany told BBC News that the research was ""interesting"".  ""If someone can get online access to your implant, it could be serious,"" he said. Cosmetic surgery Professor Capurro contributed to a 2005 ethical study for the European Commission that looked at the development of digital implants and possible abuse of them. ""From an ethical point of view, the surveillance of implants can be both positive and negative,"" he said.  ""Surveillance can be part of medical care, but if someone wants to do harm to you, it could be a problem."" In addition, he said, that there should be caution if implants with surveillance capabilities started to be used outside of a medical setting.  However, Dr Gasson believes that there will be a demand for these non-essential applications, much as people pay for cosmetic surgery. ""If we can find a way of enhancing someone's memory or their IQ then there's a real possibility that people will choose to have this kind of invasive procedure."" Dr Gasson works at the University of Reading's School of Systems Engineering and will present the results of his research at the International Symposium for Technology and Society in Australia next month.

The head of the local crisis management organisation told Irna news agency that the blaze had been contained and that no casualties had been reported. The cause was not clear, but it is the latest in a series of mysterious incidents in Iran in recent weeks.  They have included explosions and fires at a missile facility, a power plant, a medical clinic and a nuclear complex. The incidents have led to speculation about a campaign of sabotage. Iran denies reports of fresh explosion  What is behind mysterious fires at Iran sites? On Monday, there was a fire at an industrial zone near the north-eastern city of Mashhad. Officials said six gas storage tanks caught fire, and that one exploded.  The previous day, a fire broke out at a petrochemical facility in the south-western Mahshahr area which was blamed on an oil leak. And on Saturday, several gas cylinders exploded inside the basement of an apartment building in Tehran, the capital's fire department said. Iranian officials have said they are looking into whether sabotage by foreign powers or domestic opposition groups may have been the cause of earlier blasts at the Natanz uranium enrichment plant on 2 July and the Khojir missile production facility on 26 June. In 2010, a computer virus widely believed to have been developed by the United States and Israel was used to attack machinery at Natanz. Related Topics Iran

One patch is for Windows XP, which debuted in 2001 and Microsoft stopped supporting in 2014.  Microsoft said the patch closed a hole that could be used to spread a virus. Malicious hackers exploiting it could kick off a worldwide outbreak like the 2017 Wannacry worm, which hit thousands of machines.  Risky connection It was ""highly likely"" the vulnerability  would be exploited if it went unpatched,  wrote Simon Pope, Microsoft's director of incident response, in a blog about the bug. He said the bug could be exploited simply by connecting to a vulnerable machine over the internet.  ""Any future malware that exploits this vulnerability could propagate from vulnerable computer to vulnerable computer in a similar way as the WannaCry malware spread across the globe in 2017,"" he said. This danger prompted the release of a patch that closes the loophole in: Windows XP Windows 2003 Windows 7 Windows Server 2008 Market industry data suggests about  3.75% of desktop machines  currently use XP or its variants.  Technology news site  Wired said the wide range of vulnerable versions  of Windows meant ""millions"" of machines were at risk. image copyright PA image caption Microsoft no longer supports Windows XP but many people and companies still use it Although Microsoft ended support for Windows XP more than five years ago, the last software patch it issued for the operating system was released just prior to the Wannacry outbreak. ""We strongly advise that all affected systems... should be updated as soon as possible,"" said Mr Pope. Microsoft said there was no evidence that cyber-criminals were currently exploiting the loophole.  People and organisations using Windows 8 or 10 were not at risk, Microsoft said. Independent security expert Graham Cluley said  the creation of the patch for XP showed  the threat of a virulent worm was ""serious"".

The same virus may have infiltrated systems in NI, but not yet been activated, said the PSNI. The warning follows Friday's cyber-attack which affected more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. The ransomware virus locked files and demanded payment to allow access and avoid data being destroyed. The PSNI said it was working with national and international law enforcement agencies to reduce any risk to computer networks in Northern Ireland. The police have also urged public and private sector organisations and businesses to help combat the threat of a cyber attack. Vigilance urged Det Ch Insp Douglas Grant, who heads up the PSNI cyber crime unit, said there is no evidence yet that the virus has infiltrated computer networks in Northern Ireland. But he said that did not mean Northern Ireland has not been targeted. ""Thankfully we haven't experienced any of this current strain, but we must be vigilant because it could come to Northern Ireland at any point and it could have infections in our systems at the moment that just haven't activated,"" said Det Ch Insp Grant. The PSNI said its cyber crime centre would continue to actively participate ""in the national co-ordinated response to this attack and we would encourage all local businesses and public services to take immediate steps to protect their systems and reduce their vulnerability. ""We would also recommend that businesses and industries join the local Cyber Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) so they can receive the most up to date threat and mitigation information to help protect their cyber security."" Targeting 'on daily basis' The police said further information was available via the National Cyber Security Centre and appealed to anyone who believes they may be victims of cyber-attack to contact them. The National Cyber Security Centre has advised companies to: Keep security software patches up to date Use proper anti-virus software services Back up the data that matters, because you can't be held to ransom for data you hold somewhere else The police say organisations and individuals in Northern Ireland are being targeted on a daily basis by cyber criminals trying to steal data or commit fraud or blackmail.

Researchers at cyber-security company Secureworks say they reached their conclusion after analysing a new strain of computer virus. They claim the culprits are the GandCrab crew. The gang is thought to be Russian and previously sold customised ransomware to other criminals. Their code had scrambled data on victims' computers and demanded blackmail payments to decrypt it. It is estimated to have affected more than 1.5 million machines, with hospitals among those affected. In May, the group had surprised many in the security industry when it announced it was ""retiring"" after earning more than $2bn (Â£1.6bn) from the trade. Someone claiming to be part of the group claimed it had ""cashed out"" its earnings and quit the business. It had been active since about January 2018.

Eurofins Scientific was infected with a ransomware computer virus a month ago, which led British police to suspend work with the global testing company. At the time, the firm described the attack as ""highly sophisticated"". BBC News has not been told how much money was involved in the ransom payment or when it was paid. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said it was a ""matter for the victim"" as to whether a ransom had been paid. The agency, which is investigating the attack, said: ""As there is an ongoing criminal investigation, it would be inappropriate to comment."" Eurofins previously said the attack was ""well-resourced"" but three weeks later said its operations were ""returning to normal"". Cyber-attack hits police forensic work It said it would also not comment on whether a ransom had been paid or not. It added it was ""collaborating with law enforcement"" in the UK and elsewhere. The ransomware attack hit the company , which accounts for over half of forensic science provision in the UK, on the first weekend in June. Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files. Messages sent by the perpetrators demand a payment in order to unlock the frozen accounts. Eurofins deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year. It carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK. Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012. 'Court hearings postponed' An emergency police response to the cyber-attack was led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) to manage the flow of forensic submissions so DNA and blood samples which needed urgent testing were sent to other suppliers. It has led to delays in forensic science provision and is understood to have caused some court hearings to be postponed because information on the results of analysis conducted by Eurofins was not accessible. The ransom is likely to have been paid between 10 June, when Eurofins issued a lengthy statement about the attack, and June 24 when it published an optimistic update, saying it had ""identified the variant of the malware used"" in the attack and had strengthened cyber-security. It said: ""We are continuing to work intensively with leading cybersecurity experts to further secure our current systems and infrastructure and to add enhanced security features and measures to protect our systems and data."" ""The investigations conducted so far by our internal and external IT forensics experts have not found evidence of any unauthorised theft or transfer of confidential client data."" 'Reassurances' The NPCC refused to comment on the ransom payment but police sources said ""excellent progress"" had been made in dealing with the fall-out of the cyber attack.  Police and law enforcement agencies in the UK are still not submitting new samples to Eurofins for analysis but the company says it is working towards giving them the assurances they need for fresh work to restart. The Crown Prosecution Service said: ""We are working to make sure all hearings remain fair and based on reliable evidence. While investigations are ongoing, prosecutors will assess the impact on a case by case basis. ""Cases where forensic evidence does not play a major role will continue as âusual if all parties agree.  ""If âtest results provided by Eurofins are central, we will seek to adjourn cases for the shortest possible period.""

Writing in Prospect Magazine , he said such an incident would trigger a ""collective defence commitment"", known as Article 5 of its founding treaty. Article 5 has not been triggered since the 9/11 terror attacks on the US in 2001. Nato's members include the US, Canada and many European countries. ""We have designated cyber-space a domain in which Nato will operate and defend itself as effectively as it does in the air, on land, and at sea,"" he wrote in his article. It's not the first time Mr Stoltenberg has made this claim. As an example of a major cyber-incident, he mentioned  the 2017 Wannacry ransomware attack which crippled the NHS in the UK  and caused havoc around the world, although this did not trigger Article 5 at the time.  US President Donald Trump has previously criticised the 70-year-old military alliance, saying the US contributes more funding to it than any other member country. Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The idea that an attack on one is an attack on all underpins Nato - but adapting it to cyber-space raises complicated issues.  In the Cold War, a missile launch or a tank column advancing would have left little doubt of what constituted an attack.  But in the cyber-world it is not always so easy.  When Estonia saw its infrastructure hit through cyber-space in 2007, it was blamed on Russia. But was it the Russian state or ""patriotic hackers"" operating within Russia? And at whose direction?  Another issue is the threshold for considering something an attack.  Russia is accused of turning off a power station in (non-Nato member) Ukraine in December 2015. The crippling of infrastructure is one possibility for reaching a threshold for Article 5.  But what of 2017 when Russia is alleged to have launched the Notpetya computer virus against Ukraine but which then spilled over into other countries (including Nato members) damaging businesses at a cost of billions of dollars?

The evidence is comments he made in an interview after the FBI arrested him.  He wanted the testimony discounted, claiming he gave it when ""intoxicated"". A court ruling issued earlier this week threw out the request saying there was no evidence that he was under the influence of drugs. FBI agents arrested Mr Hutchins on 2 August 2017 at Las Vegas's McCarran International Airport as he was starting his journey home after attending the Def Con hacker conference. He has been held in the US ever since his arrest. He faces 10 charges related to malware, or malicious software, including a program called Kronos which is designed to steal banking credentials. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Judge JP Stadtmueller wrote: ""Hutchins appeared to be alert, engaged, co-ordinated, and coherent,"" in his ruling,  tech news site Ars Technica recorded. The judge added that there was no evidence that Mr Hutchins was under the influence of drugs but was rather suffering a ""terrible hangover"". This did not render him unable to understand the procedure or be fully aware of why he was being quizzed, said the judge.

A Russian man faces up to 10 years in jail for spreading a computer virus that cost victims more than $500m (Â£401m). Mark Vartanyan, 29, developed and distributed the Citadel Trojan, which lets criminals steal bank account details and hold files to ransom. US prosecutors said it had infected about 11 million computers worldwide.  He  pleaded guilty  to one count of computer fraud, in a court in Atlanta, after being extradited from Norway. Launched in 2011, Citadel was marketed on invitation-only, Russian-language internet forums used by cybercriminals. Its users had targeted the computer networks of major financial and government institutions around the world, prosecutors said.  'Illicit functionality' Vartanyan admitted to the ""development, improvement, maintenance and distribution"" of Citadel between 2012 and 2014 while living in Ukraine and Norway. Operating under the alias Kolypto, he uploaded  ""numerous electronic files""  that consisted of Citadel malware, components, updates and patches, as well as customer information. Earlier in March, David LeValley, special agent at the FBI Atlanta Office, said Vartanyan's arrest removed ""a significant player"" from the resources available to cybercriminals. ""We must continue to impose real costs on criminals who believe they are protected by geographic boundaries and can prey on the American people,"" he said. Vartanyan agreed to cooperate with prosecutors in exchange for a reduced prison term. He will be sentenced in June.  In September 2015, a US court sentenced Russian citizen Dimitry Belorossov to four years and six months in prison after he admitted distributing and installing Citadel on to computers. The Department of Justice said its investigation into the creator of Citadel continued.

Jonathan Marcus Diplomatic correspondent @Diplo1 on Twitter Published 30 August 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Iran nuclear deal image copyright EPA image caption Donald Trump's latest tweet has potentially set a precedent for classified information being shared by a president President Donald Trump has set a new standard for extraordinary presidential behaviour.  Not only has he tweeted what would normally be a highly classified, military-quality satellite image showing the devastation around the launch pad at Iran's main space centre following a significant explosion.  He has gone further by apparently taunting the Iranians, insisting the US was not involved in the ""catastrophic accident"" but also wishing Iran ""good luck"" in finding out what happened.  image copyright Twitter Was this presidential sarcasm or misinformation?  Was he implying that somebody else might indeed have been involved?  Or was it just the president's regular habit of responding by saying the first thing that came into his head?  It's hard to say. But, as ever, Mr Trump's intervention raises more questions than it answers.  For some weeks now experts have been reporting preparations for an Iranian space launch.  Commercial satellite imagery of the space centre showed the launch pad being made ready. The mission, according to Iranian reports, was to put a small telecommunications satellite - Nahid 1 - into orbit.  Two previous launch attempts at the start of this year had ended in failure.  This one, too, appears now to have ended in disaster. The difference, though, is that the full magnitude of the calamity has been revealed by President Trump himself.  So what caused Iran's rocket to explode so dramatically on the launchpad?  We simply do not know. But there are two obvious answers.  What would a US-Iran conflict look like? Iran nuclear deal: Key details Firstly it could have been down to a simple technical malfunction; a problem with fuel or some kind of error in the rocket's manufacture - a faulty weld seam or whatever.  These things happen; think back to some of the disasters during America's own space programme. Even the most technologically advanced nations have setbacks. But Iran's track record with launches is very poor.  A New York Times article back in February, drawing heavily on interviews with unnamed US officials, suggested that Iran's two earlier failures this year were part of a pattern.  It suggested that some 67% of Iran's orbital launch attempts over the past 11 years had failed.  It described this as ""an astonishingly high number"" compared to the average 5% failure rate for comparable launches worldwide.""  image copyright AFP image caption Tensions have been escalating between the US and Iran The article indicated that the Trump administration was moving to reactivate a sabotage programme against Iran's missile efforts by introducing faulty parts into the supply chain and so on.  A previous US effort had been phased out by President Obama. So could sabotage be implicated in this latest accident?  Who knows, but Mr Trump himself has only muddied the waters by his Twitter intervention. There is a significant history of external forces attempting to hamper Iran's military research.  Israel and the US were involved in efforts to sabotage Iran's uranium enrichment programme using a computer virus.  Iranian scientists and technicians have been assassinated.  US-Iran relations: a brief history And of course both the US and Israel see Iran's space programme as inextricably linked to its wider missile efforts.  However, the most extraordinary aspect of this affair is the president's publication of a normally classified high-resolution satellite image that could only have come from a military source.  This has thrown the missile and arms control community on the Twitter-sphere into a frenzy.  It is an amazing thing for a US president to do, giving all Washington's enemies a very public insight into its extraordinary intelligence-gathering capabilities.

The woman, Yujing Zhang, 32, told security she was at the Florida club to go to the pool, according to a criminal complaint filed in US District Court.  ""Due to a potential language barrier issue,"" staff believed she was related to a club member and let her in. Mr Trump was in Palm Beach at the time of the incident on Saturday 30 March. image copyright AFP image caption Mr Trump is known to make frequent trips to his Palm Beach property Ms Zhang - who was described in the affidavit as an ""Asian female"" - is charged with making false statements to a federal officer and illegally entering a restricted area.  According to the court documents, upon entry to the club Ms Zhang changed her story, telling a front-desk receptionist she was there to attend a ""United Nations Chinese American Association"" event.  The receptionist, who knew that such an event had been scheduled, became suspicious of Ms Zhang.  The suspect was transported off the property for further questioning.  She told agents she had been instructed by a friend, identified only as ""Charles"", to travel from Shanghai, China, to Palm Beach to attend the purported United Nations event, but did not provide any more details, according to court documents.  She said ""Charles"" had encouraged her to attempt to speak to a member of the president's family about Chinese-American economic relations, said the affidavit.

The suspension has led to delays in forensic testing, which could impact on court cases. Eurofins Forensic Services carries out DNA testing, toxicology analysis, firearms testing and computer forensics for police forces across the UK.  Its parent company, Eurofins, suffered a ransomware attack on 1 or 2 June, which is under criminal investigation. Ransomware is a computer virus that prevents users from accessing their system or personal files and demands ransom payment in order to unlock access. It is the latest in a series of major forensic science problems to hit police forces since the closure of the government-owned service in England and Wales in 2012. Forensics error drug-drive cases quashed  Met investigator 'botched' cases Forensic science standards 'at risk' An emergency police response has been put in place, led by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC), which took the decision to ""temporarily suspend"" all submissions to Eurofins.  Eurofins, which caters for over 50% of the UK market,  deals with over 70,000 criminal cases in the UK each year.  A group of senior officers will ensure the most serious crimes are given priority, as well as ensuring other forensic providers aren't overloaded with submissions. ""Our priority is to minimise the impact on the criminal justice system,"" said the NPCC lead for forensics, Chief Constable James Vaughan. ""It is too early to fully quantify the impact but we are working at pace with partners to understand and mitigate the risks."" The Crown Prosecution Service said a police investigation was ongoing, but at this stage there was ""no evidence to suggest that previous convictions were unsafe"".

Eurofins said the attack ""caused disruption to many of its IT systems in several countries"" in  a statement on it website. It said it believed the attack was carried out by ""highly sophisticated well-resourced perpetrators"" and the ransomware involved appears to have been a ""new malware variant"".    The National Crime Agency is conducting an investigation into the cyber attack, supported by the National Cyber Security Centre. A government spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with law enforcement and justice partners to investigate the sources of the attack and minimise any impact on our criminal justice system."" image copyright Getty Images Forensic science work has been carried out by private firms and police laboratories in England and Wales since the closure of the government's Forensic Science Service in 2012.

The software shares the cards with the virus's creators who then join the same game and try to fleece the victim. The sneaky malware has been found lurking in software designed to help poker fans play better, said the security firm that found it. The software also targets other useful information on a victim's computer such as login names and passwords. Card counter The malware targets players of the Pokerstars and Full Tilt Poker sites, said Robert Lipovsky, a security researcher at Eset,  in a blogpost .  When it infects a machine, the software monitors the PC's activity and springs to life when a victim has logged in to either one of the two poker sites. It then starts taking screenshots of their activity and the cards they are dealt. Screenshots are then sent to the attacker. The images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player ID. This, said Eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. Using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage. ""We are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way,"" wrote Mr Lipovsky. Eset found the Windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, PC utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases.

A successful attacker would be able to change the amount of anaesthetic delivered to a patient, CyberMDX said. Alarms designed to alert anaesthetists to any danger could also be silenced. GE Healthcare, which makes the machines, said there was no ""direct patient risk"". But CyberMDX's research suggested the Aespire and Aestiva 7100 and 7900 devices  could be targeted by hackers  if left accessible on hospital computer networks. And analysis by BBC News found multiple references online to the Aespire and Aestiva machines being used in NHS Hospitals. Nottingham University Hospitals (NUH) NHS Trust confirmed to the BBC that ""a small number"" of the devices were currently in use at its facilities, but were being phased out. ""None of the anaesthetic machines are connected to the internet or the NUH network so there is very little risk around these machines within NUH,"" a spokesman told the BBC. Security warning over hospital syringe pumps Computer virus alters cancer scan images NHS Digital said it could not confirm the extent to which the machines were still in use across the NHS. ""We are currently assessing the volume of these particular anaesthetic machines in use across England and we will be sharing any subsequent advice with trusts in the coming days,"" a spokeswoman said. Elad Luz, head of research at CyberMDX, said he was aware of hospitals in the US and Asia that also used the devices. GE Healthcare  said it was satisfied  a cyber-attack would ""not introduce clinical hazard or patient risk"".  It said this was because anaesthetic devices were ""attended"" by anaesthetists and would be monitored for any errors. The company told BBC News it did not plan to release any security updates for the anaesthetic machines but hospitals should use secure network protocols to protect them from would-be hackers. Cyber-security expert Ken Munro agreed that medical devices should be isolated within computer networks but added: ""It's not, frankly, the case in many hospital networks."" And he said GE Healthcare should bear some responsibility for the issue. ""GE absolutely have a part to play in this and they absolutely should be building devices with strong security,"" Mr Munro added. image copyright Getty Images image caption GE Healthcare has responded to the reports of a problem with its machines A malicious hacker may try to gain access to a hospital's network, locate one of the machines and then adjust its settings, said Prof Harold Thimbleby, an expert in medical device cyber-security, at Swansea University. And he gave the example of WannaCry, a ransomware outbreak  that spread through NHS computer networks in 2017 , to illustrate how an attack could unfold. ""As with WannaCry, a phishing attack can gain access and then an attacker can do what they like,"" he told BBC News. ""Given the worldwide profile of WannaCry, it is amazing vulnerabilities like this are still around."" The likelihood of harm being caused to a patient through any hacking of the devices was ""incredibly small"" said Dr Helgi Johannsson, consultant anaesthetist and Royal College of Anaesthetists Council Member. ""Patients should be reassured that their anaesthetist will be monitoring them constantly, and will have received many years of training to rectify immediately the situation of a device failure."" A spokeswoman for the UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said reports of the cyber-security vulnerability were now part of an ""ongoing area of investigation"".

Teofil Bortos, 36, of Cheltenham Gardens, Newham, east London, was in a gang that targeted 51 ATMs across England in the space of five days, the Old Bailey heard. Bortos, who admitted conspiracy to defraud ATM provider Cardtronics UK, was sentenced to seven years in prison. None of the stolen cash - Â£1,373,640 in total - has been recovered. Most of the gang remains at large. Their identities are unknown. Malware The Old Bailey heard that in May 2014, cash was withdrawn in locations including London, Liverpool, Blackpool, Brighton, Bognor Regis and Portsmouth. The scam involved activating malware on ATM computers. Following the attacks, the malware deleted itself and no customer data was compromised. While Bortos was not accused of inserting the malware, the court heard he was in a trusted position in the gang. He was present at 19 cashpoints from which around Â£191,000 was stolen.

If Rombertik's evasion techniques are triggered, it deletes key files on a computer, making it constantly restart. Analysts said Rombertik  was ""unique"" among malware samples for resisting capture so aggressively. On Windows machines where it goes unnoticed, the malware steals login data and other confidential information. Endless loop Rombertik typically infected a vulnerable machine after a booby-trapped attachment on a phishing message had been opened, security researchers Ben Baker and Alex Chiu, from Cisco, said  in a blogpost . Some of the messages Rombertik travels with pose as business enquiry letters from Microsoft. The malware ""indiscriminately"" stole data entered by victims on any website, the researchers said. And it got even nastier when it spotted someone was trying to understand how it worked.  ""Rombertik is unique in that it actively attempts to destroy the computer if it detects certain attributes associated with malware analysis,"" the researchers said. The malware regularly carries out internal checks to see if it is under analysis. If it believes it is, it will attempt to delete an essential Windows system file called the Master Boot Record (MBR).  It will then restart the machine which, because the MBR is missing, will go into an endless restart loop. The code replacing the MBR makes the machine print out a message mocking attempts to analyse it. Restoring a PC with its MBR deleted involves reinstalling Windows, which could mean important data is lost. Rombertik also uses other tricks to foil analysis.  One involves writing a byte of data to memory 960 million times to overwhelm analysis tools that try to spot malware by logging system activity. Security expert Graham Cluley said destructive viruses such as Rombertik were quite rare. ""It's not the norm,"" he said.  ""That's because malware these days doesn't want to draw attention to itself, as that works against its typical goal - to lie in wait, stealing information for a long time.""

On infected machines, the malicious program seeks out saved games and other files and encrypts them. A key to unlock encrypted files is only supplied if victims pay at least $500 (Â£340) in Bitcoins. The malware targets 40 separate games including Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Minecraft and World of Tanks. Dark web cash The malicious program looks similar to the much more widely distributed Cryptolocker ransomware that has caught out thousands of people over the last couple of years.  But analysis of the malware, called Teslacrypt, reveals that it shares no code with Cryptolocker and appears to be have been created by a different cybercrime group. Researcher Vadim Kotov from security firm Bromium said the file was catching people out via a website its creators had managed to compromise. The site involved is a Wordpress blog that is inadvertently hosting a file that abuses a loophole in Flash to infect visitors. One a machine is infected,  wrote Mr Kotov , the malware looks for 185 different file extensions. In particular, it seeks out files associated with many popular video games and online services such as Steam that give people access to them. ""Interestingly, although these are all popular games, none of them matches any particular 'Top Sellers' or 'Most Played' chart, "" said Mr Kotov. ""They could just be games the developer loves to play."" Files holding gamers' profiles, maps, saves and modified versions of games are all sought by Teslacrypt, he said. He said anyone who tries to outwit the malware by uninstalling a game they obtained via an online service may end up disappointed.  ""Often it's not possible to restore this kind of data even after re-installing a game via Steam,"" he wrote. Once target files are encrypted the malware pops up a window telling victims they have a few days to pay up and retrieve their data. To decrypt, victims can either pay $500 in Bitcoins or $1,000 in Paypal My Cash payment cards. The virus tells victims to send payment details to an address located on the Tor anonymous browsing network.  The encryption system used by Teslacrypt has yet to be cracked meaning victims would have to turn to back-ups to restore scrambled files.

""Ultimately we decided that in our particular situation we should take the shot of paying the 500 dollars in bitcoin and see if we got the decryption key returned to us and we could return all of the data that was encrypted back to its normal status."" image copyright Reuters image caption Many ransomware gangs demand payment in bitcoins Chief Sheehan conceded that it meant paying money to criminals and he now wants to highlight the threat ransomware poses. Data loss According to Raj Samani, Intel Security's chief technology officer in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, those behind ransomware are making hundreds of millions of dollars. He said there has been ""enormous growth in ransomware certainly over the last 12 months"".  He believes people in the UK are particularly vulnerable. There are many different types of ransomware viruses but according to Mr Samani ""in almost every single type we look at, the UK is either second or third on that list, so I would argue that the UK is targeted disproportionately  with regards to the number of internet users that we have."" Security experts have found ways of unlocking some forms of ransomware but those behind the cyber criminals are developing more sophisticated viruses too.  Back in the hairdressers in Glasgow, Ken Main has no regrets about paying the ransom. However, it didn't solve all his problems. Do not think paying up means all will end well. ""I would say 80 to 90% of the information was corrupted"" he said. ""In terms of hard cash income I would say we were probably down by about Â£20,000.""

The Russian firm Kaspersky Lab said the hacking at three European hotels was so sophisticated,  it must have been created by a government . World powers and Iran have been holding talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear programme ahead of a 30 June deadline. Switzerland and Austria have both opened investigations into the hacks. The US, UK, France, Germany, Russia and China are seeking a final agreement to curtail Iran's nuclear programme in exchange for sanctions relief. They fear Iran wants to build a nuclear bomb - something Iran strongly denies. Israel is not a party to the negotiations although it feels particularly threatened by the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran. image copyright AFP/Getty Images image caption Austrian investigators are looking into a hack at the Palais Coburg hotel in Vienna In March, the Wall Street Journal  reported concerns by US officials  that Israel had been spying on the behind-closed-doors talks. At the time, Israel  denied the claims it had been spying . Kaspersky, and an American security firm, Symantec, believe the so-called Duqu 2.0 software was employed to gather information. The virus infects computers across a network and is difficult to detect. Kaspersky said on Wednesday that  its own systems had recently been compromised by hackers  but the intrusion had been detected at an early stage.  Security experts had previously speculated that Duqu  may have been created by Israel or the US . ""The international reports of Israeli involvement in the matter are baseless,"" said Tzipi Hotovely, Israel's deputy foreign minister. ""What is much more important is that we prevent a bad agreement where at the end of the day we find ourselves with an Iranian nuclear umbrella."" Karl-Heinz Grundboeck, a spokesman for Austria's interior ministry, told AFP investigations in Vienna were focused on the Palais Coburg hotel, where talks took place in July last year. Switzerland's attorney general has also opened an investigation, although it is not known which Swiss hotels are affected. Police have seized computers in Switzerland. As well as Vienna, negotiations have been held in the Swiss cities of Geneva, Lausanne and Montreux, and in Germany.

This week we speak to Marcin Kleczynski, chief executive and co-founder of US antivirus software company Malwarebytes. A lot of entrepreneurs have ""a moment"". A moment that makes them realise they're on to something.  For Marcin Kleczynski it came while he was discreetly working on his antivirus software business from his student digs. His start-up company Malwarebytes was less than a year old back in late 2008, but already gaining a good reputation in the cyber security world. Marcin, then only 18, was just about managing to juggle running his start-up with participating in student life at the University of Illinois when he hit a snag. ""I was having some real trouble analysing the latest computer virus, when all of a sudden I get a white page on my screen that says 'you've been banned from the school network due to malicious activity on your desktop',"" he says. image copyright Marcin Kleczynski  image caption Marcin (left), pictured here during a game of broomball while he was a student, did have some fun at university ""They'd obviously detected that I had a virus on my computer, but didn't realise it was deliberate. So I call the university IT helpline, and they send a kid, no older than me. He sits down at my computer and looks at it and says 'boy you've really screwed this thing up'. ""Then, right in front of me, he logs onto my website and downloads Malwarebytes. ""I didn't say anything, I stood behind him and watched him fix my computer with my software to get me back online. He left never knowing who I was, but to this day I love that moment."" By the time Marcin graduated with a degree in computer science in 2012, he had quietly grown Malwarebytes into a business earning a few million dollars a year. All without any of his lecturers having any idea what was taking up his time, and pushing his grades down. Today the company has an annual turnover of more than $126m, and millions of customers around the world. Born in Poland in 1989, Marcin moved to the US with his family when he was three, settling in Chicago. As a gaming-obsessed teenager, he'd accidentally got a virus when he was 14, and learned everything he needed to know about computer bugs from internet forums and a ""For Dummies"" book. image copyright Malwarebytes image caption The company now has more than 750 employees Formally launching Malwarebytes in January 2008 when he was just 18, it grew quickly, and he decided that starting university in September of that year would just slow him down. His mother had other thoughts. ""The business was becoming real, and so I went sheepishly to my mum and said 'I don't think I'm going to go to school',"" says Marcin. ""Fifteen seconds later we were packing my stuff and I was going to school."" What made Mrs Kleczynski initially more alarmed was that her teenage son had launched the business with a man in his 30s called Bruce Harrison. Marcin and Bruce had been writing software together for more than a year, after they first started talking on anti-virus forums. ""Here's this 17-year-old kid... he's this 35-year-old man. Imagine telling your mum?..."" says Marcin. More  The Boss  features: Three months after I was paralysed, I was back at work 'I got wiped out, but I was determined to make it back' How rude service inspired a multi-million euro firm Bulletproof coffee: Would you add butter to your brew? Marcin and Bruce hadn't actually met in person at the time. Bruce was a computer repairman in Massachusetts, and Marcin was at home in Chicago. They didn't in fact see each other in the flesh until Malwarebytes was more than 12 months old. ""We didn't meet until we made our first million about a year after we launched the product,"" says Marcin. ""Even that was kind of anti-climatic. It was just, 'Hey, Bruce!' - We had a handshake and moved on.""  Today Bruce, who is head of research, still lives and works on the US east coast, while Marcin is based in the head office in Silicon Valley. The company now has more than 750 employees, and overseas offices in the Republic of Ireland, Singapore and Estonia. Since 2014 it has secured $80m of investment funding. image copyright Marcin Kleczynski  image caption Marcin is a qualified pilot who likes to fly in his spare time Malwarebytes says its software now performs 187 million virus scans every month for individuals and businesses, and is installed more than 247,000 times every day. Like many antivirus companies it operates a ""freemium"" business model - the basic version is free, but you can then pay for more advanced protection. While the company has consistently grown strongly, Marcin has learned some hard lessons along the way. The most difficult time was navigating the business through an almost catastrophic period in 2014 where the product glitched on a huge scale. ""We had a false positive which means we detected a piece of malicious software that wasn't actually malicious at all,"" he says. ""Our software ended up mistakenly bringing down hundreds of thousands of computers. We had 911 emergency centres go down, hospitals go down, it was bad. This has happened to every anti-virus company, by the way, but these mistakes can be company killing because you lose trust.  ""But we fixed it and got through it. Even today, the system that we created to prevent this from happening again is called 'The Malwarebytes Extinction Prevention System' - our engineers have a great sense of humour.""  image copyright Marcin Kleczynski  image caption He met his future wife while at university Carl Gottlieb, a cyber security podcaster, says that despite operating in the ""notoriously hostile"" antivirus industry ""Malwarebytes is thriving"". ""With so many competing vendors, brand awareness is key, and that step [which Malwarebytes took] to offer a free product years ago is paying dividends, with so many customers knowing the name and already using it in their homes. What Marcin and his team have achieved is impressive to see."" Still only 29, Marcin says his young age has been an advantage. He encourages other budding teen entrepreneurs to start their own business. ""You've heard my story, I started the company when I was living with my parents,"" he says. ""And then even at college, it was all paid for on a student loan, so I was getting fed. If you're in college now, instead of going out and getting drunk with your friends, maybe take one night a week just to see if there's anything you want to work on personally."" He admits that his university years were harder than his friends', that he barely passed his degree, and his social life no doubt suffered. However, he's glad his mum forced him to go. ""For one thing, I met my wife there,"" he says. Related Topics Entrepreneurship Cyber-security Computers Software Information technology"

He then proceeded to tell me that a problem had been detected with my Windows computer. Having had similar calls before, I thought I knew what was coming. So instead of putting the phone down, I decided to play along and record the call. The man at the other end told me to go to my computer and type in a complex series of instructions.  Then he asked me if I was seeing a certain string of letters and numbers. ""Ooh yes,"" I said. That was proof, he told me, that my computer was sending out the error message that his company had received - and which had led him to call in the first place. So I then sought to find out what he was suggesting I do about my badly infected computer.  ""We will first have to check out the problems and what it will take to fix them,"" he told me. That might cost nothing or just a minimum charge but if I wanted complete protection over a longer period that would be Â£159. At that point, I decided to reveal that I had been stringing him along. I do not have a Windows computer at home, so I had not been typing in the instructions - though when a colleague tried it later on a PC at work following the same commands, he came up with same string of numbers and letters. The man at the other end was first bemused, then rather cross. He accused me of wasting his time and energy, then when I asked for a telephone number to contact his firm's PR department, he terminated the call. Now this is a well-known scam, which can involve selling you software you don't need or even having your computer taken over for malicious purposes. There are plenty of warnings from Microsoft and from security experts that any call you get from someone claiming they know what is happening to your PC should be terminated rapidly. But some people are getting repeated calls, and there must be quite a few who are worried enough to fall for the scam. My caller - who appeared by the way to be completely convinced that he was offering a legitimate product - told me that his firm had lots of satisfied customers. The other question which I wanted answered was how the firm had got hold of my number - which I've listed with the Telephone Preference Service in order to avoid getting these calls. The caller said it was on ""an international database"". If that is so, then someone is involved in a potentially illegal trade in personal data. But as this company - like most of them - was based overseas they may not care too much about that. So it looks as though we can all expect to carry on getting these calls - and will have to choose to ignore them, or perhaps string them along for a while to waste their time. View comments"

In densely populated areas with lots of wi-fi networks, the virus can go from network to network finding weaknesses. Once in control of a wi-fi access point, it leaves computers on the network extremely vulnerable. The team's lead researcher told the BBC it was working on software to prevent such attacks being possible. ""Rather than rely on people to use strong passwords, you want to integrate intrusion detection systems to the access points,"" said Alan Marshall, professor of communication networks at the University of Liverpool. He would not go into detail about the methods in order to prevent the attack being used on real victims but said a proof-of-concept attack had been developed at the university. 'Under control' The virus, dubbed Chameleon, seeks out wi-fi access points - devices that transmit the wi-fi signal, found in many homes - that have not had their admin password changed. image copyright bbc image caption Many people do not change their wi-fi admin password This password is different from the one used to log on to the wi-fi network itself, and is often left unchanged from the default setting. Once an access point is under a hacker's control, new firmware can be installed. ""So it's now under our control,"" explained Prof Marshall. ""Once you do that you can then do other things with it. You can recover passwords, steal data - anything you want."" Spreading out But it is the next step of the virus that is most unusual. Once installed on one access point, the virus can - without being controlled by a human - automatically seek out other vulnerable access points, taking them over as and when they are found. Prof Marshall told the BBC that this was unlikely to be a threat to big business wi-fi networks, which should have enhanced security in place. However, networks in homes, or at small premises like coffee shops, are typically found with less stringent protection measures in place. Now that his team has demonstrated the threat, Prof Marshall said attention would turn to creating a product that could be installed in wi-fi access points to prevent this kind of hijacking - without requiring the user to take responsibility.

UK Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was ""ripping up the rule book"" and the UK would respond. Moscow denies being behind the attack, calling such claims ""Russophobic"".

The country Ukraine has been locked in a simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists since Moscow annexed Crimea in 2014. In the NotPetya attack, businesses with strong trade links with Ukraine, such as the UK's Reckitt Benckiser, Dutch delivery firm TNT and Danish shipping giant Maersk were affected. The attack is estimated to have cost companies more than $1.2bn (Â£850m). media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware?

""In June 2017, the Russian military launched the most destructive and costly cyber attack in history,"" a statement said. ""This was also a reckless and indiscriminate cyber attack that will be met with international consequences.""

In July, the Royal College of Surgeons revealed nearly 9,000 fax machines were in use across the NHS in England. The Department of Health said a change to more modern communication methods was needed to improve patient safety and cyber security. An RCS spokesman said they supported the government's decision. In place of fax machines, the Department of Health said secure email should be used. NHS still reliant on 'archaic' fax machines Oxford University Hospitals Trust scraps fax machines Why is hi-tech Japan using cassette tapes and faxes? Richard Kerr, who is the chair of the RCS's commission on the future of surgery, said the continued use of the outdated technology by the NHS was ""absurd"". He added it was ""crucial"" that the health service invested in ""better ways of communicating the vast amount of patient information that is going to be generated"" in the future. The group's report from earlier this year found the use of fax machines was most common at the Newcastle upon Tyne NHS Trust, which still relied on 603 machines. Three-quarters of the trusts in England replied to the survey - 95 in total. Ten trusts said that they did not own any fax machines, but four in ten reported more than 100 in use. 'Stuck in the dark ages' Rebecca McIntyre from Manchester, who works as a cognitive behavioural therapist, said fax machines are ""a continued risk to the confidentiality and safeguarding of patients"". ""You would not believe the palaver we have in the work place trying to communicate important documents to services (referrals etc),"" she said.  ""We constantly receive faxes meant for other places in error but this is never reported."" Meanwhile, Taz, from Doncaster, works in a pharmacy and said discharge notes, emergency documents and out-of-hours services ""all are stuck in the dark ages"". ""I hope this is just the start of many changes,"" he said. ""The amount of time wasted and potential errors that exist from not using technology is shocking and often it's the patients that suffer. ""My next hope is that hand written prescriptions are scrapped completely and we use tablets to send them electronically for patients like most GPs have been doing for years."" Malicious fax leaves firms open to attack Why the fax machine isn't quite dead yet However, Tim Owen. from Bolton, who works in blood services, asked: ""So what happens when a computer virus attacks a hospital's IT infrastructure, as happened recently?  ""During the  WannaCry attack of 2017  our 'out-dated, redundant' piece of equipment ensured that blood products, not routinely held in our on-site blood bank, could be ordered without delay and therefore not compromising patient safety."" One GP in the Midlands said they currently rely on a fax machine for requesting x-rays at local hospitals because of an ongoing IT problem which has not been fixed. 'I fax my brother for fun' Meanwhile, outside of the NHS, Nina Mowbray, from Northampton, works for one of the top 10 accountancy firms where she said they still fax documents to HM Revenue and Customs. ""We could email but we need to have this set up first which means we have to get formal approval from a director/partner which we don't do,"" she said. ""It does seem very outdated.""

In January, Latvian Deniss Calovskis was named by the US as one of the creators of the Gozi virus. Latvian courts have twice rejected Mr Calovskis' appeal to prevent himself being extradited, but the country's foreign minister opposes the move. He said the potential jail term Mr Calovskis faced was too severe for the crimes he is alleged to have committed. The US began its campaign to extradite two of the three men alleged to have used Gozi soon after publicly accusing the trio of infecting more than one million computers with the virus and stealing data that was then used to plunder bank accounts.  They ran a ""modern-day bank robbery ring, that required neither a gun or a mask"", said US attorney Preet Bharara in January. Romanian Mihai Ionut Paunescu and Russian national Nikita Kuzmin were named as the co-creators of Gozi. Mr Kuzmin is already in jail in the US following his arrest in May 2011 on separate hacking and fraud charges. Extradition proceedings against Mr Paunescu are currently on hold pending an appeal. In a message posted to the website of Latvia's Foreign Ministry, minister Edgars Rinkevics said Latvian law guaranteed that people who broke the law suffered only ""proportionate punishment"".  Mr Rinkevics said the US sought a jail term for Mr Calovskis that exceeded 60 years.  While he could not take a view on whether Mr Calovskis broke the law or not, the jail term amounted to an effective life sentence, he wrote.  ""In my view, such a penalty is disproportionate to the amount, and so far no-one has been able to conclusively dispel my fears that it might be otherwise,"" he said. In addition, he said, there were questions over whether any of the crimes Mr Calovskis is alleged to have committed actually took place on US soil. The trans-national nature of much cyber crime would make it hard to prove his involvement, wrote Mr Rinkevics. Finally, said the minister, if Mr Calovskis was found guilty there was no reason why he could not serve a sentence for his crimes in his native Latvia.  Security analyst Graham Cluley said Gozi was a very successful trojan that pilfered huge sums from bank accounts. ""If you caught a criminal who stole sums like that in traditional bank robberies, you would expect them to have the book thrown at them and wouldn't be surprised if they ended up with a serious criminal sentence,"" he said. ""It's important to see more co-operation internationally to bring internet criminals to justice, and a consistency in the treatment and sentencing of convicted hackers,"" he added.  ""It's necessary when investigations cross national boundaries that proper legal processes are followed, which can mean it takes a lot of time and effort to get a result,"" said Mr Cluley.

A funeral home in Livingston, Montana, where the actress lived, said Kidder died at her home on Sunday. She rose to fame starring alongside Christopher Reeve in the Superman films of the 1970s and 1980s. The Canadian-born actress acquired American citizenship in 2005, and became a political and women's rights activist alongside her acting. The cause of her death is not yet known. Kidder starred alongside Reeve in the 1978 film Superman and its sequels, as well as horror classics Black Christmas and The Amityville Horror. The actress was also an outspoken critic of the Gulf War, of fracking by energy companies, and was at times a vocal supporter of Democratic party candidates. After settling in the US state of Montana, she became a supporter of Montana Women For, a non-profit organisation which describes its goals as the ""participation and empowerment of women in our democracy through education and advocacy on critical issues"". As an activist, she was arrested in 2011 while taking part in a protest at the White House against  the Keystone XL pipeline , which remains controversial today. Kidder also suffered from mental health problems, which resulted in her high-profile disappearance for several days in 1996. image copyright Getty Images image caption Kidder, seen here in 2009, continued to work alongside her activism In an interview with People magazine later that year , she referred to her disappearance as ""the most public freak-out in history"". While working on her memoirs, a computer virus destroyed all of her work, she told the magazine - something she concluded was deliberate, and involved her former husband and the CIA. She was eventually found safe, and would talk openly about her experience of manic episodes and of depression in the years ahead, raising awareness about bipolar disorder while advocating the use of alternative medicine as a treatment. On social media, film and superhero fans paid tribute to the actress. DC Comics, publisher of the Superman comic books, said Kidder was ""the Lois Lane so many of us grew up with"". Eric Goldman, editor at rival comic book maker Marvel, said Kidder ""made sure my generation knew just how awesome Lois Lane was"" - a sentiment echoed by famed comic book writer Mark Millar, who said she was ""my Lois Lane"". Teri Hatcher, who played Lois Lane in the 1990s TV show Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman, wrote that it had been ""a privilege"" to step into Kidder's role - while her co-star  Dean Cain also tweeted his condolences . It is a privilege to have shared the same role of Lois Lane with this wonderful actress. She led the way brilliantly.

It quoted unnamed ""Western officials with knowledge of the effort""                           as its sources  .          The powerful malware was discovered after the UN noticed data disappearing from PCs in the Middle East. The Post said the US National Security Agency, the CIA and Israel's military had collaborated on the project. It had ""intended to slow Iran's nuclear program, reduce the pressure for a conventional military attack and extend the timetable for diplomacy and sanctions"", the newspaper said.  Reuters subsequently reported                           that current and former Western national security officials   had told the news agency the US had been involved in making the virus.          The BBC has been unable to confirm or disprove the allegations. Flame is thought to have been first noticed when Iran's servers were taken offline in April following a malware attack on key oil terminals. Covert action A later report by anti-virus company Kaspersky Labs said there had been 189 attacks in Iran, 98 in Israel and Palestine, and 32 in Sudan.  A ""former high-ranking US intelligence official"", who it said had spoken on the condition of anonymity, told the Washington Post: ""[Flame] is about preparing the battlefield for another type of covert action. ""Cyber-collection against the Iranian programme is way further down the road than this."" Iran has said it is now able to defend itself against the malware and clean up infected PCs . Under siege But the attacks could lead the country to develop its own sophisticated cyber-capabilities, Mark Phillips, a research fellow at defence think tank the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), told BBC News. ""If it did originate from the US and/or Israel, Iran is going to feel under siege as a result of a number of attempts - a previous one was Stuxnet - and will seek to improve its cyber-defences,"" he said. ""The better you are at detecting cyber-actions, the better you are at infiltrating others.  ""This cyber-onslaught that Iran has been facing from Stuxnet through to Flame is actually helping it to become a really serious cyber-power in its own right, which would not have been an intended effect of whoever developed Flame."" Nation-state involvement Security experts call Flame one of the most complex threats ever seen, suggesting a nation state rather than individual hackers are likely to have been behind its development. ""The reason [sources] may want to stay anonymous is because of the sensitive nature of technologies and capabilities involved,"" said Mr Phillips.

The malicious software - dubbed Stars - was capable of inflicting minor damage, according to the head of Iran's civil defence organisation. If the reports are accurate, it would be the second major attack in a year. The recently discovered Stuxnet worm is thought to have been created to take control of equipment used in Iran's nuclear programme.

Gozi was first found in 2007 but remained active for years and is thought to have infected more than one million computers worldwide.

A computer hacker known as Iserdo has been arrested in Slovenia. The 23-year-old is believed to have written the program behind the mariposa virus, also known as butterfly.  The botnet, one of the world's largest, was dismantled earlier this year after infecting 12.7 million computers.  It was designed to steal personal financial details and was also found in the PCs of banks and major companies. Officials from around the world have been chasing the cyber criminals. In December 2009, three people believed to have been running it were arrested in Spain.  ""To use an analogy here, as opposed to arresting the guy who broke into your home, we've arrested the guy that gave him the crowbar, the map and the best houses in the neighbourhood,"" Jeffrey Troy, deputy assistant director for the FBI cyber division told Associated Press. Botnet background Botnets are networks of computers with malicious software installed. This puts them under the control of cyber criminals without the knowledge of individual owners.  They can send spam e-mail from the host's machine or search for information such as credit card details and send them back to their creator. They also send replica programmes to other computers, sometimes via the e-mail of the host. Security expert Rik Ferguson told the BBC that the mariposa botnet had got out of control. ""They guys behind it said it was more successful than they had intended to be,"" he said. ""As is the case with most botnets, the more widespread they are the more likely they are to be discovered. They were a victim of their own success."" Mr Ferguson, senior security adviser at Trend Micro, added that while it was not unusual for a botnet to infect hundreds of thousands of computers, one infecting several million was rare. Nobody has yet been arrested in connection with the Conficker worm, a similar virus which is currently running on 6 million Windows PCs and is believed to peaked at up to 12 million, he said. While the core group behind a particular botnet is generally quite small, there is a whole industry of people offering ""cyber crime services"" such as tool kit building and program writing, he added. ""The thing with the underground economy is that it's full of niche vendors and players, it mirrors legitimate business. There's a lot of competition - it's not unusual to see malware designed to remove other malware, just so that it can take over.""

The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. Internal emergency media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: ""Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services.  ""We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications."" It later said no patient data or care had been affected.  Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: ""It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems.  ""However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online."" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware.  In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back. Ransomware growth image copyright Thinkstock Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros ""if the data encoding is incorrect"". Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said:  ""It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. ""I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.""

He also pardoned 64 others, in one of his final acts as US president.  One of the most controversial releases is that of Chelsea Manning, the transgender US Army private  who leaked confidential messages  to Wikileaks. Neither a pardon (doing away with a conviction) nor a commutation (changing a sentence) is an acceptance of innocence. They're granted when convicted criminals are believed to have fulfilled their debt to society, or are seen as deserving for some reason. Dwight J Loving - serving a death sentence He was convicted of murdering two taxi drivers while he was a soldier in 1989 and has been on death row ever since.   His offences included pre-mediated murder, attempted murder and armed robbery. He was one of six military personnel facing the death penalty in the US. Loving's death sentence has been commuted to life imprisonment with some conditions. Willie McCovey - served probation image copyright Getty Images The baseball Hall of Famer was fined and given two years' probation in 1996 for failing to pay taxes. It was the earnings he made on sports memorabilia and signing autographs. He's been pardoned. Ian Schrager - served a prison sentence The nightclub boss used to own Studio 54 in New York (it was the place to be in 70s). He and co-founder Steve Rubell did time for tax evasion. He's also been pardoned.  James Cartwright - was awaiting sentencing image copyright Getty Images/ AFP The former US marine general pleaded guilty to falsely denying he was the source of leaking classified information. The leak involved a computer virus that disabled equipment Iranians were using to enrich uranium. He's been pardoned. Oscar Lopez - serving a 70-year sentence image copyright Getty Images The 74-year-old  was arrested in 1986  after appearing on the FBI's most wanted list. He was part of the Armed Forces of National Liberation of Puerto Rico (FALN), an underground organisation that fought for the independence of Puerto Rico. His crimes included carrying carrying firearms during violent crimes and moving explosives with intent to kill, injure and destroy property. Lopez should now be released in May and plans to return to Puerto Rico. image copyright Reuters Arboleda A Ortiz - serving a death sentence The 48-year-old was sentenced to death for his role in murder and drug trafficking in 2000.  During the trial he maintained that officers who questioned him never told him he had a right to an attorney or a right to remain silent. His attorneys said he never learned to read or write in any language. Anti-death penalty advocates say he is intellectually disabled and his execution would be unconstitutional. He's no longer sentenced to death. How do pardons and commutations work? Mr Obama has commuted 1,385 sentences and issued 212 pardons, more than the total granted by the past 12 presidents combined. The White House tweeted a graph, showing that Obama has commuted more sentences than other US presidents. In America, a pardon not only lifts the conviction and sentence but removes other penalties such as the bar on convicted felons sitting on federal juries, and state-level prohibitions on such things as voting or possession of firearms. A commutation means the sentence is changed but the restrictions outlined above remain. When Donald Trump assumes office, he won't be able to undo the pardons and commutations Obama has put in place.

UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine team said testing and tracing contacts of those with the virus might help prevent this. But the current test and trace system would need to be more effective. The study  is the first to assess the extent of contact tracing that will be needed to prevent a second wave. It used computer models to see how the virus might spread as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were freed from childcare and able return to work or other activities. The academics investigated the impact of the ""phased return"" strategy in England. They analysed what happens when Reception, Year 1 and Year Six go back at the start of June; followed by all primary school pupils in July; secondary pupils in Year 10 and 12 having some contact in July and all secondary schools going back in September. The study showed the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave without an effective test and trace programme. This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as re-imposing lockdown. SCHOOLS:  When will children be returning? EXERCISE:  What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:  What it means and why it matters AIR TRAVELLERS:  The new quarantine rules LOOK-UP TOOL:  How many cases in your area? How test and trace works:  People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for seven days and their household does so for 14 days They have to tell the NHS everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine The success of the scheme is dependent on how well the testing and the contact tracing goes.  The model suggested a second wave would be prevented if: 51% of people were being tested and 40% of their contacts traced Or if 43% of people were being tested and 80% of their contacts traced Modelling is not a crystal ball and there is always uncertainty around any predictions. However, researchers are concerned England is not achieving those figures.  About 1,700 people are testing positive every day in hospitals, care homes and the wider community, while figures from the Office for National Statistics suggest there are 5,600 new infections a day in the community alone - and one Public Health England report  suggests 17,000 infections per day . There is still no official data on the number of contacts being traced, but  a report by the Times (paywall) suggests it is less than 40% . ""Our concern from the data at the moment is test-trace-isolate is not reaching the coverage we think is the minimum,"" Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. ""There is clearly a risk of a second pandemic waveâ¦ I'm worried. The R [rate of virus spread] is a bit below one [the point at which the number of new cases starts to take off again], but the incidence is high so it's precarious."" media caption Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, said it would have been better to wait until test and trace was fully up and running before lifting lockdown.  ""Cases are not coming down as much as we wanted. I would caution against reopening schools when we are doing a lot of other interventions and we don't know the impact of them. ""Everything depends on control of transmission, there is the threat of a second pandemic wave."" Meanwhile, researchers at the University of Warwick have also published modelling on the impact of reopening schools. It looked only at the impact of children mixing, not the society-wide effect of schools opening.  It found that halving the size of classes or focusing on getting younger children into school was less likely to push the R number above 1, the point at which the number of new cases starts to take off again.  Secondary schools were deemed more risky, as older children come into contact with more people.  ""If we reopen all schools it could push R above 1 in some regions,"" Dr Ed Hill said. But he added: ""Decisions surrounding reopening of schools are a difficult trade-off between the epidemiological consequences and the needs of the children in terms of educational development.""

UK security researcher ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"". The virus, which took control of users' files, spread to 100 countries, including Spain, France and Russia. In England, 48 NHS trusts fell victim, as did 13 NHS bodies in Scotland. Some hospitals were forced to cancel procedures and appointments, as ambulances were directed to neighbouring hospitals free from the computer virus.  UK Home Secretary Amber Rudd said on Saturday that the problem was largely resolved but that ""there's always more"" that could be done to protect against computer viruses. NHS trusts that appear to still be experiencing IT difficulties are: St Bartholomew's in London East and North Hertfordshire Trust James Paget University Hospitals Trust, Norfolk Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust York Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust University Hospital of North Midlands Trust After taking computers over, the virus displayed messages demanding a payment of $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock files and return them to the user.  BBC analysis of three accounts linked with the global attack suggests the hackers have already been paid the equivalent of Â£22,080.  MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.  Blogger halts ransomware 'by accident' The ransomware causing chaos Analysis: How it started The 22-year-old told the BBC: ""It's very important that people patch their systems now. ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us.  ""There's a lot of money in this. There's no reason for them to stop. It's not really much effort for them to change the code and then start over. ""So there's a good chance they are going to do it... maybe not this weekend, but quite likely on Monday morning."" On Sunday he warned hackers could upgrade the virus to remove the ""kill switch"" that helped to stop it. ""Version 1 of WannaCrypt was stoppable but version 2.0 will likely remove the flaw. You're only safe if you patch ASAP,""  he tweeted . Fellow security researcher Darien Huss, from tech firm Proofpoint, echoed MalwareTech's view. ""I highly suspect that, with the amount of coverage that this incident is getting, there are probably already people that are working to incorporate the exploit that was used for spreading,"" he said. He said his research experience on targeted attacks made him doubt a nation state was involved here.  ""This attack was so simple and unsophisticated, that leads me to believe the people or person involved, even though they are quite capable, they're more along the lines of an amateur,"" he said. Investigators are working to track down those responsible for the ransomware used on Friday, known as Wanna Decryptor or WannaCry. media caption Ron Grimshaw was having an MRI scan when nurses told him they had to stop because of a cyber-attack The virus exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software, first identified by the US National Security Agency, experts have said.  Europol described the cyber-attack as  ""unprecedented""  and said its cyber-crime team was working with affected countries to ""mitigate the threat and assist victims"". Oliver Gower, of the UK's National Crime Agency, added: ""Cyber criminals may believe they are anonymous, but we will use all the tools at our disposal to bring them to justice."" Update not applied In the UK, critics said the government had known about the threat of a cyber-attack for some time, but hospitals had not made the right upgrades to protect themselves.  A security update - or patch - was released by Microsoft in March to protect against the virus, but it appears many NHS organisations had not applied it or were using an older version of the operating system no longer supported - namely Windows XP. NHS Digital said that 4.7% of devices within the NHS use Windows XP, with the figure continuing to decrease. media caption Home Secretary Amber Rudd said most of the NHS was now ""working normally"" But Kingsley Manning, a former chairman of NHS Digital, said several hundred thousand computers were still running the out-of-date operating system. Mr Manning told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some trusts took the advice that was offered to them very seriously and acted on it and some of them may not have done. ""If you're sitting in a hard-pressed hospital in the middle of England, it is difficult to see that as a greater priority than dealing with outpatients or A&E.""

They fear that the virus infections could become so severe that a patient may end up getting harmed. Out-dated computer systems which were not able to be changed were to blame for the vulnerabilities, the experts said. One US hospital is said to be deleting viruses from up to two machines a week. The warnings were given as part of a panel discussion in Washington DC, as reported by  Technology Review from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology . Mark Olsen, chief information security officer at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, said the hospital had 664 pieces of medical equipment running on old versions of Windows. This means the equipment is affected by weaknesses which later releases of Windows have since fixed. Kevin Fu, a leading expert in medical technology, explained that the machines were not updated because of fears that doing so would mean they were in breach of regulations put in place by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA approve the use of technology by testing safety rather than security - meaning any potential exposure to cyberthreats is not considered. Raised eyebrows ""I find this mind-boggling,"" Mr Fu told Technology Review. ""Conventional malware is rampant in hospitals because of medical devices using unpatched operating systems. There's little recourse for hospitals when a manufacturer refuses to allow [operating system] updates or security patches."" There are also fears, the panel agreed, that medical devices could even end up being part of botnets - large networks of hijacked computers that are often used to send out spam email. Medical devices could be struck down by slow performance related to being infected, Mr Fu told the BBC. ""Imagine you have a heart monitor that's running Windows and it gets infected by a computer virus and slows down.  ""This mere slowing down of the computer could cause the device to miss a sensor reading. It certainly raises an eyebrow. Who's watching out for that?"" He said that there is no evidence as yet that the malware is reaching medical machines as a result of being targeted by criminals.  Instead, he said it was more likely to be ""collateral damage"" from conventional malware designed to infect normal PCs. ""What we're finding is that software has brought tremendous benefit to medicine, but we've kind of forgotten that there's these inconvenient risks of software,"" he said. In the UK, the NHS faces similar challenges. ""The need to implement security and privacy at the design of all systems, whether they're embedded or not is of paramount importance, particularly to the health industry,"" said Raj Samani, who worked in the health sector and is now chief technology officer for security specialists McAfee. A Channel 4 investigation in 2008 discovered that  NHS computers had been affected by more than 8,000 viruses .

On Friday, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it had new information on ""possible military dimensions"" to Iran's nuclear plans, which Iran says are purely peaceful. The IAEA will supervise the unloading of fuel from Bushehr, Iran's nuclear envoy Ali Asghar Soltanieh said.  Iran began the Bushehr project in 1976. Iran's Fars news agency says the fuel is being removed for ""technical reasons"". The fuel at Bushehr is being provided by Russia, which built the plant and whose engineers will carry out the unloading, under the supervision of the IAEA.  ""Upon a demand from Russia, which is responsible for completing the Bushehr nuclear power plant, fuel assemblies from the core of the reactor will be unloaded for a period of time to carry out tests and take technical measurements,"" Mr Soltanieh said, according to the semi-official Isna news agency.  Computer virus? The BBC's Tehran correspondent, James Reynolds, says diplomats suggest the entire core of the Bushehr plant is being replaced - potentially a serious problem.  There has been some speculation that the Stuxnet computer virus may be responsible, our correspondent says.  Analysts say Stuxnet - which caused problems at another Iranian enrichment facility last year - has been specially configured to damage motors commonly used in uranium-enrichment centrifuges by sending them spinning out of control.  Some experts believe that the problems at Bushehr call into question the safety and effectiveness of Iran's nuclear facilities as a whole, our correspondent says.  The IAEA report - obtained by the BBC and made available online  by the Institute for Science and International Security (Isis)  - says Iran is ""not implementing a number of its obligations."" These include ""clarification of the remaining outstanding issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme"". Six world powers are negotiating with Iran over its nuclear programme, and the country is subject to United Nations Security Council sanctions over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment. Enriched uranium can be used for civilian nuclear purposes, but also to build atomic bombs.

The computer virus is believed to have hit the internal computer systems at Iran's oil ministry and its national oil company. Equipment on the Kharg island and at other Iranian oil plants has been disconnected from the net as a precaution. Oil production had not been affected by the attack, said the Mehr news agency. However, the attack is believed to have been responsible for knocking offline the websites of the Iranian oil ministry and national oil company.  The Ministry website was back in action on Monday but the oil company site has remained unreachable. An Iranian oil ministry spokesperson was quoted as saying that data about users of the sites had been stolen as a result of the attack. Core data about Iran's oil industry remained safe because it was on computer systems that remain separate from the net, they added.  The terminal on Kharg Island handles about 90% of Iran's oil exports.  Iran is reported to have mobilised a ""cyber crisis committee"" to handle the aftermath of the attack and bolster defences.

The New York Times said that Delhi police made the arrests  during raids on 26 call centres linked to the scams. Software giant Microsoft helped police trace who was behind the large-scale operations. It said it received more than 11,000 calls per month about fake security warnings and that many people lost significant sums to the fraudsters. ""This is an organised crime,"" Courtney Gregoire, an assistant general counsel in Microsoft's digital crimes unit told the US newspaper.  Microsoft has estimated that fraudsters make about $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) a year through fake Windows support calls. media caption What happened when sextortion scammers targeted a BBC Trending reporter? Raids on 16 call centres were carried out this week and, earlier in November, another 10 locations were visited by police.  The raids were prompted by Microsoft filing complaints with local police in New Delhi about call centres it claimed were involved in the fraudulent operations. Typically, said Microsoft, attempts to trick people revolved around pop-up warnings that falsely claimed that a person's computer was infected with a virus.  Fixing the non-existent virus could involve ringing a tech support centre. An operator would talk a victim through a fake fix and then charge them for the work. In another version of the scam, staff at call centres claimed to be calling from Windows official support saying they had spotted that a person's computer has been hacked or harboured a virus. Again, victims were expected to pay to fix the non-existent problem.  Some people caught out by the scam paid up to $1,000 for the fake tech support, said the newspaper.

The scale of the criminal operation has been detailed by the three sources, who say they were employed by two front-companies set up by a gang of professional fraudsters. The sources describe working in ""call centres"" in two Indian cities.  They say as many as 60 ""employees"" work in shifts in each office, phoning TalkTalk customers and duping them into giving access to their bank accounts. The whistleblowers say they were given a script in which they were told to claim they were calling from TalkTalk.  They say they then convinced victims to install a computer virus.  A separate team would use that virus to gain access to victims' online banking, they add. While it has not been possible to independently verify their claims, the sources have given highly detailed accounts of the scammers' tactics, which correlate very closely with previous reports of fraud targeting TalkTalk customers. The software they named also  matches that identified by TalkTalk  in its own website guidance on what to watch out for in a scam call. In addition, a victim of the fraud shown the call centre script has confirmed it matched the one read out to her when she was conned out of Â£5,000. image caption One of the whistleblowers shared this screenshot of one of the scripts TalkTalk was hit by a cyber-attack in October 2015, but that hack appears to be unrelated to the Indian fraud. Instead, it is alleged the scam is linked to problems in a company hired by the British broadband provider. In 2011, TalkTalk outsourced some of its call-centre work to the Kolkata (Calcutta) office of Wipro, one of India's largest IT service companies.  Last year, three Wipro employees were arrested on  suspicion of selling TalkTalk customer data . A source in Kolkata, who did not want to be named, alleges the same data was obtained by a criminal gang, with USB sticks full of data trading hands at parties. The criminals then used the data to operate at least three call centres, according to the whistleblowers, where staff work in shifts earning about Â£120 per month to perpetrate an intricate but highly successful scam. They say they phone TalkTalk customers, using the stolen data to convince victims they are genuine employees of the company.  They then convince the victims their computers are infected, and offer to fix the problems.  Through this, the whistleblowers say, the victim is tricked into installing a virus that gives the scammer complete control over their machine. image caption The leaked scripts indicate workers were told how to fool victims into believing them The victims are then offered a compensation payment, for which they must log in to online banking, they add.  Thanks to the virus, the fraudsters are able to gain access to the victims' bank accounts when they log in.  They say they use various methods to spirit away the money: in some cases pretending to make erroneous overpayments, then convincing victims to repay the extra amount. In other cases, victims have said the scammers were able to set up a new payee without their knowledge and transfer the money out of the account directly. Why the whistleblowers appear credible: Although the BBC cannot be sure of the whistleblowers claims, the following suggested they were telling the truth: the three whistleblowers approached us seemingly independently of each other; the information they shared - including the scripts they were told to read out - correlated to a high degree during extensive online conversations, they revealed in-depth knowledge of the scammers' techniques, much of which is not in the public domain and matches the experience of TalkTalk fraud victims one of the whistleblowers shared a copy of his driver's licence, confirming his identity the whistleblowers said they were ignorant of the full scale of the fraud, because the eventual bank account theft was handled by a separate, smaller team in a different office at one stage, two of the whistleblowers attempted to share the information of UK victims they had called, and asked us to warn the victims before they fell for the scam Dozens of customers are said to have been affected, and many have lost thousands of pounds as a result of the fraud.  Leigh Day solicitors is representing about 20 people who have between them lost almost Â£100,000. image caption The scripts suggest TalkTalk customers were told that inaction would cause their computers to stop working Questions remain about the speed with which TalkTalk responded to the data breach at Wipro, which is believed to have been in late 2014.  It was only in October 2015, after the apparently unrelated cyber-attack, that TalkTalk began a ""forensic review"" leading to the arrests at Wipro. ""We are aware that there are criminals targeting a number of UK and international companies, and we take our responsibility to protect our customers very seriously,"" said a spokeswoman for TalkTalk. ""This is why we launched our Beat The Scammers campaign, helping all our customers to keep themselves from safe from scammers no matter who they claim to be, while our network also proactively blocks over 90 million scam and nuisance calls a month."" Wipro did not respond to requests for comment. When contacted, the two companies named by the whistleblowers strongly denied any knowledge of criminal behaviour, and insisted their businesses were legitimate.

The civil nuclear infrastructure in most nations is not well prepared to defend against such attacks, it added. Many of the control systems for the infrastructure were ""insecure by design"" because of their age, it said. Published by the influential Chatham House think tank, the report studied cyber defences in power plants around the world over an 18-month period. Core breach Cyber criminals, state-sponsored hackers and terrorists were all increasing their online activity, it said, meaning that the risk of a significant net-based attack was ""ever present"". Such an attack on a nuclear plant, even if small-scale or unlikely, needed to be taken seriously because of the harm that would follow if radiation were released. In addition, it said ""even a small-scale cyber security incident at a nuclear facility would be likely to have a disproportionate effect on public opinion and the future of the civil nuclear industry"". Unfortunately, research carried out for the study showed that the UK's nuclear plants and associated infrastructure were not well protected or prepared because the industry had converted to digital systems relatively recently. This increasing digitisation and growing reliance on commercial software is only increasing the risks the nuclear industry faces.  There was a ""pervading myth"" that computer systems in power plants were isolated from the internet at large and because of this were immune to the kind of cyber attacks that have dogged other industries. However, it said, this so-called ""air gap"" between the public internet and nuclear systems was easy to breach with ""nothing more than a flash drive"". It noted that the destructive Stuxnet computer virus infected Iran's nuclear facilities via this route.  The story of Stuxnet image copyright Getty Images In 2009, a malicious computer program called 'Stuxnet' was manually uploaded into a nuclear plant in Iran. The worm took control of 1,000 machines involved with producing nuclear materials, and instructed them to self-destruct. What made the world's first cyber-weapon so destructive? The researchers for the report had also found evidence of virtual networks and other links to the public internet on nuclear infrastructure networks. Some of these were forgotten or simply unknown to those in charge of these organisations. Already search engines that sought out critical infrastructure had indexed these links making it easy for attackers to find ways in to networks and control systems.  Keith Parker, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""Security, including cyber security, is an absolute priority for power station operators."" ""All of Britain's power stations are designed with safety in mind and are stress-tested to withstand a vast range of potential incidents,"" he added. ""Power station operators work closely with national agencies such as the Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure and other intelligence agencies to always be aware of emerging threats."" In addition, said Mr Parker, the industry's regulator continuously monitors plant safety to help protect it from any outside threats. In June this year the International Atomic Energy Agency held its first international conference about the cyber threats facing plants and manufacturing facilities. At the conference Yukiya Amano, director of the IAEA, said both random and targeted attacks were being directed at nuclear plants.  ""Staff responsible for nuclear security should know how to repel cyber-attacks and to limit the damage if systems are actually penetrated,""  he said in a keynote address to the conference . The civil nuclear industry should do a better job of measuring cyber attack risks and improve the way it defends against them, according to Chatham House. Many plants examined by the report's researchers lacked preparedness for large-scale attacks that took place outside office hours. ""The nuclear industry is beginning - but struggling - to come to grips with this new, insidious threat,"" said Patricia Lewis, research director of Chatham House's international security programme.

Speaking after an emergency Cobra meeting, Ms Rudd said ""there's always more"" that could be done to protect against computer viruses. She said 97% of NHS trusts were ""working as normal"" and there was no evidence patient data was affected. The ransomware attack hit organisations in at least 99 countries. Europol described it as  ""unprecedented""  and said its cyber-crime team was working with affected countries to ""mitigate the threat and assist victims"". Ms Rudd insisted the government had ""the right plans"" to limit the impact of the attack, which also affected the  Nissan car plant in Sunderland . 'Britain left defenceless' The Liberal Democrats and Labour have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Lord Paddick said ""it has left Britain defenceless"". Labour's Jonathan Ashworth also called for a ""full, independent inquiry"" into the cyber-attack. As of 21:00 BST on Saturday, the following NHS England trusts were still reporting IT difficulties on their websites: St Bartholomew's in London East and North Hertfordshire Trust James Paget University Hospitals Trust, Norfolk Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust York Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust The 48 NHS trusts affected did not include GP practices. Thirteen NHS bodies were also affected in Scotland. The Scottish government said most NHS computers were expected to be operational by Monday. NHS England said patients needing emergency treatment on Saturday evening should go to A&E or access emergency services as they normally would. However, a small number of non-urgent services may take some time to return to normal. For example, United Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust has already cancelled routine appointments, tests and operations on Monday. Blogger who halted ransomware 'hasn't slept a wink' What is the global ransomware outbreak? Cyber-attack 'unprecedented' in scale Analysis: How it started The malware spread quickly on Friday leaving hospitals and GPs unable to access patient data, with many doctors resorting to using pen and paper. Their computers were locked by a ransomware program which demanded a payment to access blocked files. Hospitals across the UK were cancelling operations and ambulances had been diverted from hospitals in some areas. Lynne Owens, head of the National Crime Agency, said: ""At this moment in time we don't know whether it's a very sophisticated criminal network or whether it's a number of individuals operating together.""  Patient's story: 'Pulled out' of MRI scan Ron Grimshaw, 80, was halfway through an MRI scan to test for prostate cancer at Lister Hospital in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, when staff became aware of the attack. I got there at 11am, went through the usual formalities. Got my gown on, they put a feed into my wrist to send dye around my blood stream. I was put in the scanner for 10 minutes and then I was pulled out again.  The nurses were saying something about a cyber-attack meaning their systems were down. They weren't sure when it was going to start again so I waited for a bit. But it never happened and I went home. I was meant to have a chest X-ray as well and that was cancelled. I gave them my mobile number and they said they'd ring me back telling me when to come in. You've got to sympathise with the nurses as they will have to work extra hours. It was unbelievable you don't expect to go to hospital in the middle of a cyber-attack. Damn nuisance. The virus, identified as WannaCry, exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software first identified by the US National Security Agency, experts have said. Kingsley Manning, a former chairman of NHS Digital, said the government and the NHS had been ""very well aware"" that a cyber-attack was a threat and ""significant amounts of money"" had been invested ""in anticipation that this sort of thing would happen"". Cyber-security responsibility After the home secretary expressed disappointment that some health trusts were still operating computer systems on Windows XP, despite having been advised to upgrade, Mr Manning claimed that several hundred thousand computers were still running Windows XP. He added that the government would have been aware of that. Mr Manning told BBC Radio 4's PM programme: ""Some trusts took the advice that was offered to them very seriously and acted on it and some of them may not have done. ""If you're sitting in a hard-pressed hospital in the middle of England, it is difficult to see that as a greater priority than dealing with outpatients or A&E. ""It's very difficult to get individual trusts to use the money for this purpose."" NHS Digital said that 4.7% of devices within the NHS use Windows XP, with the figure continuing to decrease. How did the attack work? media caption Experts discuss the attack: ""The most terrifying thing about this is how simple it is."" The ransomware used in the attack is called WannaCry and attacks Windows operating systems. It encrypts files on a user's computer, blocking them from view, before demanding money, via an on-screen message, to access them again.  The malware seems to have spread via a computer virus known as a worm. Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. Some experts say the attackers used a weakness in Microsoft systems which is known to the US National Security Agency as ""EternalBlue"". A cybersecurity researcher tweeting as @malwaretechblog has claimed to have found a way to slow down the spread of the virus after registering a domain name hidden in the malware. He said that the malware makes a request to a domain name, but if it is live the malware stops spreading. A security update - or patch - was released by Microsoft in March to protect against the virus, but it appears many organisations have not applied the patch - or may still be using outdated systems like Windows XP.

Increased transmission would also result from parents not having to stay at home with their children, they say. Researchers said getting pupils back to school was important - but more work was needed to keep the virus in check. The head of the NHS test and trace scheme said it was ""already delivering"" and on the right track for future.  Baroness Dido Harding said: ""I absolutely don't accept that this is failure, it's the opposite."" She said more testing is required but maintained the current level of contact tracing was ""well within the bounds"" of what the researchers ""are saying is necessary"".  The UK government said plans were in place to ensure schools can reopen safely at the start of the school year. England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate contact tracing systems. Asked about the estimate that only 50% of contacts are being traced in England, Simon Clarke, minister for regional growth, told the BBC government figures were higher. He said NHS test and trace is ""maturing all the time"" and getting children back to school in the autumn is a ""top priority"" that the government would not ""be willing to trade"". ""You're building an entirely new infrastructure which there's no precedent for,"" he said. ""But we're confident it is working, we're confident that it will continue to improve, and we're confident that it will allow schools to open safely in the autumn."" 'Very bad surges' Dr David Nabarro, the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid-19, said the virus is ""capable of surging back really quickly"" and stressed the importance of being able to trace, test and isolate people. ""If we can do that, and do it well, then the surges are kept really small, they're dealt with quickly and life can go on,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He later said he thinks Britain ""will do really well"" because there is ""really good attention to where the virus is locally"" and a lot of ""public engagement in getting on top of it"". A government spokesman said local authorities will ""be able to determine the best action to take to help curb the spread of the virus should there be a rise in cases"". LOCKDOWN LIMIT:  Can we lift lockdown any further? SCHOOLS:  When will children be returning? EXERCISE:  What are the guidelines on getting out? THE R NUMBER:  What it means and why it matters LOOK-UP TOOL:  How many cases in your area? Researchers from UCL and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine used computer models to see how the virus might spread in the UK as pupils returned to the classroom and their parents were more able to go back to work or resume other activities. The study assumes children  are less likely to catch  - and therefore spread - coronavirus and that some parents would continue to work from home.  As first reported in June , the combined effect on pupils and parents would be enough to cause a second wave if there was no effective test-and-trace programme.  This would happen around December 2020 and would be twice as big as the first peak, unless the government took other actions such as reimposing lockdown. The study,  now formally published in the Lancet Child and Adolescent Health , shows a second wave could be prevented if: both 75% of people with Covid symptoms were found and 68% of their contacts traced or both 87% of people with symptoms were found and 40% of their contacts traced 'Doesn't look good enough' However, the researchers said NHS test and trace in England was falling short.  They estimate only half of contacts are being traced and while it is harder to know the percentage of people being tested, they say this also appears too low.  ""It is not achieving the levels we have modelled. It doesn't look good enough to me,"" said Prof Chris Bonell, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Dr Jasmina Panovska-Griffiths, from UCL, added: ""With UK schools reopening fully in September, prevention of a second wave will require a major scale-up of testing to test 75% of symptomatic infections - combined with tracing of 68% of their contacts, and isolation of symptomatic and diagnosed cases."" How test-and-trace works: People with symptoms of cough, fever or loss of sense of smell or taste are tested If they are positive for coronavirus, they isolate for 10 days and their household does so for 14 days They have to inform the NHS of everyone they have come into close contact with These contacts must also spend 14 days in quarantine Postcode search: See case numbers in your area GCSE students allowed to drop poetry in 2021 exams Schools will be ready for September - minister Schools have been shut around the world as countries used lockdowns to control the spread of Covid-19. It is estimated  1.6 billion children  have been kept out of the classroom. In the UK, schools closed on 20 March, except to children of key workers or vulnerable children. On 1 June, they began a limited reopening for early years pupils, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6. Schools are due to restart for all children in Scotland on 11 August and across the UK in early September. But every step taken to open up society makes it easier for the coronavirus to spread.  Cases are  already starting to rise  and the idea of closing pubs in order to open schools  has already been floated .  The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, has said ""we are near the limit"" of what we can do without causing a resurgence. The individual nations of the UK have their own contact tracing systems. The government said NHS test and trace in England has reached 80% of those testing positive and traced over 75% of their contacts. The Welsh government said its advisory group recommended that schools open in September with all pupils present on site, and ""we should be aiming to trace an estimated 80% of contacts, at least 35% of which are to be traced within 24 hours"". Since 21 June, 90% of close contacts were reached by the service,  according to Welsh government figures . A Scottish government spokesperson said guidance set out ""a number of specific risk-mitigation measures that will need to be introduced"" including an ""enhanced surveillance programme"". In Northern Ireland,  the latest figures for the week to 29 July  showed 98% of contacts were successfully reached by the country's contact tracing service.

It saw 4,507 cases of cyberbullying in 2012-13, up from 2,410 in 2011-12. The charity also saw a rise in concerns about self-harming, while depression and difficult family relationships were the top reasons for seeking help. For the first time in the charity's history, more counselling took place online (59%) than by telephone (41%). Peter Wanless, chief executive of the NSPCC charity which runs Childline, said: ""The issues facing children today are very different from those that faced us as children. ""Stranger danger, for example, rarely comes up in contacts to Childline but depression, self-harm, online bullying and even suicide contacts are increasing exponentially.

At present, online shopping, banking and voting are protected using digital signatures based on mathematical formulae, which can be cracked. The new approach uses photons to create ""quantum digital signatures"" which it is claimed ""ensures authenticity"". Findings from teams at Strathclyde and Heriot-Watt Universities are published in the journal Nature Communications. The value of online retail sales in the UK last year was estimated to be between Â£25bn and Â£50bn. 'Virus attacks' The cost of electronic crime for the UK retail sector in the financial year 2011/2012 was estimated to be Â£205m. As criminals become more sophisticated in targeting transactions, organisations are being forced to look at new ways to protect themselves and customers from hacking, data theft and fraud. Physicists at Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh, and Strathclyde University in Glasgow, say they have used particles of light - photons - to create a new way of verifying electronic transactions. Professor Gerald Buller, from Heriot-Watt University, said: ""Computer virus attacks have shown that signatures or specific codes can be hijacked, potentially causing chaos with systems being crippled, accounts hacked, and industry and consumers losing millions of pounds.  ""Our new approach, using quantum mechanics rather than just maths to create signatures for multiple recipients (or customers), could make hacking, fraud and theft near-impossible."" The Heriot-Watt and Strathclyde teams say a quantum-based signature means ""a malevolent third party"" cannot fake a signed message which is being sent to multiple recipients. 'Authentic signature' The system works when a sender writes the signature with encoded light particles and sends it to the receiver. The receiver cannot yet read the signature but can be sure it received an authentic signature. To confirm a message is authentic and to also read it, the receiver then has to receive both the message (the signature) and additional information required to decipher it. Once multiple receivers confirm that they have received identical signatures, only then does the sender provide the additional information required to read the signature.  The research teams say this process takes place without customers having to do anything differently to current security methods.

The Department of Enterprise's Trading Standards Service has issued the appeal. It said scams are estimated to cost NI consumers Â£100m every year.  This year's top five festive scams include fake credit providers promising fast loans online and ""I've been robbed"" emails asking for money. The other scams are fraudulent software support companies phoning to say your computer has a virus which is stealing all your bank details, fake websites selling counterfeit goods and ""free trials"" of slimming and beauty products which actually commit you to large monthly payments. Damien Doherty of Trading Standards Service (TSS) said there had been about 50 complaints since the start of November about the purchase of counterfeit goods online. He said the majority related to fake Ugg boots and GHD hair straighteners. ""People will see a website which says UK Ugg boots, UK GHD,"" he said. ""If it is a .co.uk the website is registered in a domain in the UK, if it is .com it can be registered anywhere in the world. ""The majority of the counterfeit websites are actually Chinese websites, you can do a 'who is?' check online which shows you where the website is registered, if it is China or the Far East, the chances are the goods are fake.

A ransomware virus infected the firm's computer systems, laboratory work was suspended for seven weeks and police investigations and trials were delayed.  In his first interview since the incident, Mark Pearse told BBC News it could happen to any organisation. ""It's a threat to society,"" he said.  ""There is no sector that's immune to this,"" said Mr Pearse, commercial director of Eurofins in four countries, including Britain. ""We've got the transport sector, the energy sector, the health sector, other public organisations, the criminal justice system. ""We're all vulnerable,"" he said. What is ransomware?  More than half of British firms report cyber-attacks  Cyber-crime victims 'lose Â£190,000 a day' 'Grinding halt'  The cyber-attack affected Eurofins' IT systems in the 47 countries where it operates.  Mr Pearse said he was first told about it in a call at 05:00, as he was about to catch a flight from Manchester Airport, and spent the day on the phone dealing with the fallout. ""The labs are quite dependent on IT and everything these days is either controlled by IT, all the data is stored on servers, and so the processes quickly came to a grinding halt,"" he explained. image copyright Getty Images Eurofins' forensic science division in the UK, where it has seven sites and 60% of the market, was especially badly hit, so after consulting police chiefs and senior prosecutors, the company decided to stop accepting samples of blood, DNA and other scientific evidence from suspects, victims and crime scenes. ""It has huge implications,"" said Mr Pearse, a molecular cell biologist who used to work for the Metropolitan Police and  the state-run Forensic Science Service .  ""We're the biggest private provider so that was quite a decision to make,"" he said.  ""We do many hundreds, many thousands of cases and samples...  ""So very quickly the job in hand was partly to investigate the cyber-incident, and the consequences from an IT perspective... and to provide continuity of service."" Ransom paid?  The National Police Chiefs' Council co-ordinated emergency measures to manage the flow of specimens submitted for analysis so that the most serious cases were given priority by other providers.  ""Inevitably, if you take 60% or so of the capacity out of the forensic science sector you can't carry on as 'business as usual',"" said Mr Pearse.  ""The other suppliers can't cope with all the work so backlogs, to a limited degree, did build up in police forces.""  Towards the end of July  a backlog of 20,000 samples had developed   but that has now been cut to around 10,000 as services have returned to normal. BBC News was told that Eurofins had  paid the cyber-criminals a ransom to restore its IT systems  but Mr Pearse refused to comment.

By Frank Gardner BBC security correspondent Published 15 November 2011 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption Seventeen Revolutionary Guards were killed in the explosion at Bid Ganeh at the weekend Assassinations of nuclear scientists, a sophisticated cyber-attack, and now, last weekend, a mysterious blast at a munitions base that has killed the ""godfather"" of Iran's ballistic missile programme. The explosion at the Bid Ganeh base was so powerful, it killed 17 Revolutionary Guard Corps soldiers and rattled windows in Tehran several miles away.  Iran says it was an accident, but few who follow events there are convinced.  The recent talk may be all about a future, desperate last-ditch military strike by Israel to destroy Iran's suspected nuclear weapons programme, but to all appearances, a covert ""black ops"" campaign to disrupt it has already been under way for some time.  At least three Iranian nuclear scientists have been killed in the past two years, and last winter, a computer virus codenamed Stuxnet was introduced into Iran's nuclear enrichment centrifuges, causing havoc and setting back the programme by several months. Mahan Abedin, a leading researcher in terrorism studies, says: ""The assassination of Iran's scientists and the introduction of the Stuxnet computer virus last year constitute state terrorism.""  No-one, of course, is claiming responsibility for these actions, but US intelligence is widely believed to have had a hand in developing the Stuxnet virus, while Iranian officials have previously accused Israel of being behind the assassinations.  Of all the countries in the region to feel threatened by Iran, Israel is most alarmed by the Iranian nuclear programme. On Sunday Israeli Defence Minister Ehud Barak said of the explosion at the base: ""I don't know the extent of the explosion but, it would be desirable if they multiplied."" International concern Plenty of other countries share Israel's concerns about Iran's growing military power, though they tend not to express it publicly.  On Tuesday, a Gulf Arab official who asked not to be named told the BBC: ""We are very worried about Iran, it's getting to the point where it's a very dangerous scenario. 2012 is a crucial year when decisions are going to have to be taken"".  In a cable leaked by Wikileaks, it emerged Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah had urged the US to deal decisively with Iran and stop its suspected nuclear weapons programme.  The Saudi monarch used the poetic language of the Nejdi desert, urging Washington to ""cut off the head of the snake"".  The UAE, involved in a long-running territorial dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands, has also been quietly urging the West to contain Iran and stop it acquiring a nuclear bomb.  Bahrain's Sunni monarchy also sees Iran as essentially a hostile neighbour bent on stirring up Bahrain's Shia majority and encouraging it to press for an Islamic republic.  Last week, the Bahrain government announced it had uncovered a terrorist plot to blow up the causeway linking it to Saudi Arabia, adding that the suspects had links to Iran. 'Latent capability' But at a forum on Iran hosted in London on Monday by the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS), many voiced the view that Iran was hell-bent on acquiring the nuclear bomb and there was very little that was going to deflect it.  Referring to the steady ratcheting up of Western sanctions on Iran, Sir Richard Dalton, the UK's ambassador to Tehran from 2002-06, said: ""There is no sanctions policy out there that will change Iran's behaviour.""  However he questioned the benefit of the apparent covert action against Iran, saying ""whoever is behind these actions needs to make the case for them publicly, and I'm not sure at all that that case holds water."" Mr Abedin said: ""No tool, no pressure, not even the toughest of sanctions, nor even military conflict will work [to steer Iran away from becoming a nuclear weapons power].""  Mark Fitzpatrick, the IISS resident expert on Iran's nuclear programme, is in no doubt which direction Iran is heading.  He told the forum: ""I think Iran probably already has a latent nuclear weapons capability."""

The Crime Survey for England and Wales included the offences for the first time in its annual report, which covered the year to September. Separate figures recorded by police showed an 8% rise in offences overall.  The Office for National Statistics said crime recording improvements meant the police figures could not reveal trends. 'Crime has changed' John Flatley, from the ONS, said: ""In the past, burglary and theft of vehicles were the high-volume crimes driving trends but their numbers have fallen substantially since then. ""When the crime survey started [35 years ago], fraud was not considered a significant threat and the internet had yet to be invented. ""Today's figures demonstrate how crime has changed, with fraud now the most commonly experienced offence."" Sir Tom Winsor, the Chief Inspector of Constabulary for England and Wales, told the You and Yours programme on BBC Radio 4 that many frauds went undetected and a great deal never got reported to the police. ""The amount of fraud that is taking place now is probably in epidemic proportions,"" he added. ""The police are having to work very, very hard to keep up with even the ones they know about. ""The capability at police forces is quite skeletal and that needs to change and change a great deal.""  The National Police Chiefs' Council lead for crime and incident recording, Chief Constable Jeff Farrar, said forces were working with the Home Office, police and crime commissioners, and industry experts to develop new tactics to fight cybercrime.

Other frauds including investment or fake charity scams There are two broad categories of ""computer misuse"" crimes:  Unauthorised access to personal information, including hacking Computer virus, malware or other incidents such as ""DDoS"" attacks aimed at online services  Des Dillon, who runs a student accommodation company, told BBC Radio 5 live he had become a victim of cybercrime after being tricked into giving away information that led to the loss of Â£230,000 from his company bank account.  ""Over a couple of phone calls, he asked me for various [information], third number, fourth number and ninth letter, that type of thing, and obviously he put it together very quickly,"" he said.  ""We've recouped [over] Â£100,000, we're outstanding Â£113,000. We managed to block and recoup the balance and now we're fighting [with the bank] about the other portion of it."" Katy Worobec, director of Financial Fraud Action UK, said banks had managed to stop Â£6 in every Â£10 targeted by criminals in the first half of 2016, but that people needed to be aware of the threat.  ""While the industry invests in new systems to stop the criminals, fraudsters are increasingly targeting people directly,"" she said.  ""Customers and businesses need to be alert to the threats posed by the continued rise in impersonation scams attempting to trick them out of their personal details and money."" Homicide rise All but one police force - Nottinghamshire - recorded an increase in violent crime last year. The largest percentage increases were logged by Northumbria Police, up 95%, Durham Police (73%), West Yorkshire Police (48%) and Avon and Somerset Police (45%). ""Violence against a person"" offences now include revenge pornography and internet trolling, which the ONS believes contributed towards the 22% rise from last year.   Police recorded 695 homicides in the 12 months to the end of September - 125 more than the previous year. This included the 96 cases of manslaughter resulting from the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, because the inquest verdicts were returned during the last recording period. Excluding those deaths, there was still a 5% rise in homicides.  Criminals looking for new opportunities By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent image copyright PA The figures for fraud and computer misuse show how behind the curve our statistics have fallen.  It is undeniable that the overall level of crime has been falling across the industrialised world for a quarter of a century, as report after report on our experiences show we are less and less likely to be victims.  However, while traditional crimes such as burglary and theft fall, criminal gangs look for new opportunities by exploiting gaps in online and banking security.  The brutal fact is that nobody knows how big the problem is. It is massively underreported and, outside of London, it is arguable that national policing hasn't yet got the skills or the expert manpower it needs.  A good detective must have the skills to catch a burglar or killer, but very few of them have the skills to analyse screens of information and find criminals who have taken the digital road to a life of crime. While there was a 23% increase in attempted murders, the ONS said this may have been ""influenced"" by improved crime recording. Recorded offences involving a knife or sharp weapon hit their highest level for five years, up 11% up on the previous year to 30,838. There was a 7% rise in gun crime, which BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said had been mainly driven by an increase in offences involving handguns and shotguns, but added that some of the increase might be accounted for by better firearm identification processes. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said the crime figures were akin to ""the warning lights flashing."" Investing in security Policing minister Brandon Lewis said reforms of the police were ""working"" and the offences ""traditionally"" measured by the survey - before the inclusion of fraud and cybercrime - had fallen by 370,000. Mr Lewis said  the government was investing Â£1.9bn in cybersecurity over five years , adding that the survey helped inform efforts.   ""Understanding more about these crimes will help us continue to protect those who are vulnerable,"" he said.

Bushehr was supplying 60 megawatts of its 1,000 megawatt capacity to the national grid, officials said. The reactor's generating unit began operating at a low level in May, prompting Israel and other nations to express fears the reactor could help Iran develop nuclear weapons. Tehran says its intentions are purely peaceful. But the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said it is ""increasingly concerned"" that Iran is also secretly working on components for a nuclear weapons programme. Dogged by delays Iran's Atomic Energy Organisation said the plant in the country's south was connected to the national grid at 23:30 (19:00 GMT) on Saturday.  The connection had initially been scheduled for late last year but, as with developments at Bushehr since the project began in the 1970s, it was dogged by delays. Construction on the plant was abandoned after Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution until the mid-1990s, when Moscow reached a billion-dollar deal with Tehran to complete it. In February, Iran had to remove fuel from the reactor ""for technical reasons"", amid speculation that the Stuxnet computer virus may have been responsible. The United States and other Western nations for years urged Russia to abandon the project, warning it could help Iran build atomic weapons. But an agreement obliging Tehran to repatriate spent nuclear fuel to Russia eased those concerns. In February, an IAEA report obtained by the BBC and made available online  by the Institute for Science and International Security (Isis)  - said Iran was ""not implementing a number of its obligations."" These included ""clarification of the remaining outstanding issues which give rise to concerns about possible military dimensions to its nuclear programme"". Six world powers are negotiating with Iran over its nuclear programme, and the country is subject to United Nations Security Council sanctions over its refusal to halt uranium enrichment. Enriched uranium can be used for civilian nuclear purposes, but also to build atomic bombs.

November was never really the month to visit Paris. It's not quite Christmas, when the cold brittle lights of the great department stores glisten in the December darkness. And it's a long way from April with its sensuous hint of warmer, longer evenings to come. At this time of year fallen leaves still lie around the plane trees, as though they've been shrugged off in an involuntary shudder at the coming of winter.  Some things here never change of course. Order pig's trotters in the best restaurant near my old apartment building and they still come with a diamond pattern burned in to the crispy skin on the grill, as though they were wearing Argyll socks.  And riders of motor scooters still squirm irritatingly through lines of static traffic in a clumsy waddle as though they were carrying the weight of the bike between their clenched buttocks. You find yourself searching for the comfort of the familiar at moments like this, when things are superficially familiar but when the truth is that they've been changed utterly. image copyright Reuters This time last month Paris was the capital of a country that was involved in a very modern type of war, in which laser-guided, computer-controlled missiles were being dropped on targets in Syria, a distant former colony.  Now it is a front line in a modern form of conflict in which the comfortable landscape of any European or American city can become a physical battlefield.  The enemy wears no uniform and acknowledges no law of war.  Its foot-soldiers could be a man or woman sitting next to you on a bus who work alongside you, who grew up hearing the same news and studying the same history lessons as you - and came to dangerously different conclusions.  They might live alongside you as sleepers for years before strapping on a suicide vest or picking up an assault rifle and venturing with deadly intent into the same streets they travel on their daily journey to work. Of course the truth is that almost all of the commuters sitting around you looking bored or tired or apprehensive are exactly what they seem. France, its politicians say, is at war but it's an exhausting, nerve-wracking kind of war in which nothing might happen for months or  years but where equally tomorrow may bring the chaos and fear of the battlefield to the streets of the city.  image copyright AFP Terrorists target the comfortable certainties of daily life. A big part of what they want is that nagging fear they install at the back of your mind like a computer virus. Is that jumpy-looking young man with a rucksack a suicide bomber or just a nervous student on his way to an exam? When you say goodbye to your children on their way to a party in a bar or to a rock concert are you really saying goodbye? What good does it do to say ""Take care,"" or ""Safe journey,"" to the people you love when you know that no amount of care that they might take will really protect them and that the safety of their journey is not really in their own hands? All of this week, Parisians have been thinking all of these thoughts and yet somehow life here has ground on in the gathering gloom of November. image copyright Getty Images But if the weapon of the terrorist is fear and the uncertainty that flows from it, well, we ordinary citizens of Paris, Peterhead, Peoria and points beyond have a weapon of our own.  It is the dogged durability that got Parisians out to work again in the days after those terrible attacks - the foot soldiers' ability to soldier on through the darkness.  Paris is a little subdued just now - not quite as I remember it. But people are eating in restaurants, and working in offices and factories and grumbling in queues. Life has gone on not with some great show of bravado but with a kind of determination that is all the more impressive for being understated. So maybe I was wrong to say that November is not the best time to be here. It  is a little grey and rainy and the fears and uncertainties about the future are real enoughâ¦ but when you think about the endless emotions the old place has lived through in a week, really, it's never looked better to me.

The International Atomic Energy Agency gave no reason for the temporary halt in the enrichment of low-grade uranium. But there was speculation that a complex computer worm which infected the personal computers of staff at the country's first nuclear power station, at Bushehr, might be the reason. Iran on Tuesday denied that the Stuxnet worm had caused any damage. The West fears Iran's ultimate goal is to build nuclear weapons. Iran says its programme is aimed solely at peaceful energy use. 'Real problems' In a report leaked to several news agencies, the IAEA said that none of the centrifuge units at Iran's Natanz plant were being fed for enrichment to lower-levels when inspectors visited the site on 16 November. On both earlier and subsequent visits more than 4,800 such centrifuges were being fed with nuclear material.  It was not clear whether the technical problems suffered at the plant, which are reported to have included power fluctuations, were due to the computer virus. One senior diplomat quoted anonymously by Reuters news agency said that Iran was using an old centrifuge model which has been dogged by breakdowns for years.  ""I don't think you can necessarily blame Stuxnet entirely. There could be some other issues but clearly they have been having some real problems,"" the senior diplomat told Reuters. Cyber experts say the worm, which Iran said in September had attacked its computers, has been configured to damage centrifuges and is capable of seizing control of industrial plants. Some Western experts have said its complexity suggests it could only have been created by a ""nation state"". Senior Iranian officials have said that the virus is evidence that an ""electronic war"" has been launched against the country.

computer+virus|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40286280|Company directors targeted by identity fraudsters By Kevin Peachey Personal finance reporter Published 15 June 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Company directors are the victims of one in five cases of identity fraud, according to fraud prevention organisation Cifas. They account for 19% of victims of these type of fraud cases, despite making up less than 9% of the UK population. Directors have been targeted directly by scams owing to the potential for con-artists to steal large sums. Fraud victims are most likely to be aged between 31 and 50, Cifas said. However, the biggest rise in 2016 from the previous year was among those aged 21 and under. The report, by Cifas and LexisNexis Risk Solutions, also warned that fraudsters were attempting to obtain credit files as a pre-cursor to committing identity fraud.  Some 47% of recorded identity frauds involving fraudulently obtained credit files from company directors took place in London and the South East of England. In comparison, Wales and the North East of England each accounted for 2% of these fraud cases.     Social engineering The vast majority of identity fraud takes place when a fraudster pretends to be an individual, so as to buy a product or take out a loan in their name.  Fraudsters get hold of the necessary personal material by stealing mail, computer hacking, obtaining data on the dark web, and exploiting personal information on social media, according to Cifas. They can also gather it though social engineering, where people give up personal information to someone pretending to be from their bank, the police or a retailer.  Cifas advises people to shred important paper documents - and use passwords, privacy settings and anti-virus software on their computers. How to protect yourself from identity crimes Limit the amount of personal information you give away on social networking sites. Your real friends know where you live and know your birthday Update your computer's firewall, anti-virus and anti-spyware programmes. Up to 80% of cyber threats can be removed by doing this Never share passwords or PINs (personal identification numbers) with others and do not write them down Use strong passwords and PINs - don't use your date of birth or your child's name, include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and punctuation marks. Aim for a minimum of 10 characters in a password Do not use the same password or PIN for more than one account Shred all your financial documents before you throw them away Source: Cifas Related Topics Personal finance Fraud More on this story Three words to set alarm bells off for every firm Published 31 March 2017 The 'bogus boss' email scam costing firms millions Published 8 January 2016 Identity fraud at record levels in 2016 Published 15 March 2017

William Hague told a conference in Munich how government computers had been infected by a virus last year. He also detailed an attempt to steal data from a UK defence contractor. Mr Hague claimed cyberspace was providing ""rich pickings"" for criminals and urged governments to move faster to counter the threat. In his speech, Mr Hague went into detail about some of the recent attacks to which systems in the UK have been exposed.

Mr Hague said: ""Our experts were able to clear up this infection but more sophisticated attacks such as these are becoming more common."" Defence contractors in the UK were also being targeted, the foreign secretary said, describing an attempt by someone masquerading as an employee of another defence firm to send a malicious file designed to steal information. 'Hostile state agency' Mr Hague also said that last month three of his staff had been sent an e-mail apparently from another colleague in the Foreign Office. In fact the e-mail was ""from a hostile state intelligence agency"" and contained ""code embedded in the attached document that would have attacked their machine."" The foreign secretary said the e-mail had been prevented from reaching its intended targets. ""These are the kind of threats we are now facing every day,"" he said. Mr Hague said these kinds of cyber-threats called for a ""global response"", with like-minded countries agreeing standards of behaviour on the internet.

Or rather its alluring visage because this one involved the dating site Beautiful People. The story was that a computer virus, handily named Shrek, had attacked the sites systems, allowing 30,000 people to evade the normal beauty screening procedures and gain access to the site. Now they were being chucked off the site, to their great distress, and offered counselling for the pain that caused them. Well guess what - journalists loved this story. All sorts of respectable new outlets - including it must be said parts of  the BBC  - rushed to cover it, so that the name beautifulpeople.com was heard across the land, indeed around the globe. But one respected security blogger immediately smelled something rather ugly. Graham Cluley of Sophos  pointed out  that the website said it had not informed any computer security firms about the Shrek attack because it was being investigated internally and member privacy had not been affected. Phew! So, lots of publicity for the website but nothing for current or future members to worry about then. How convenient! Mr Cluley's conclusion is that this was all just a publicity stunt. He points out that the sites PR firm Golden Goose won a prestigious public relations award for a previous story about Beautiful People members letting themselves go over Christmas. But the site and its PR handlers reacted with hurt outrage at the suggestion that the story might perhaps have been the result of some creative thinking rather than a real hacker attack. A spokeswoman for the firm said it was a genuine incident which had cost a lot to repair:  ""Beautiful People had to refund over 61,000 to people who paid for premium services who were then rejected."" Now Graham Cluley has issued a challenge  via this tweet : ""If Beautiful People forward the Shrek virus to an anti-virus firm for analysis Ill give 500 quid to Children in Need."" Over to you, Beautiful People. Surely, having been damaged so badly by this evil piece of malware, the opportunity to earn some money for a great charity is too beautiful to miss? View comments"

Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the problems had been created by enemies of Iran, but had had only a limited effect. Iran has repeatedly denied that Stuxnet had affected its nuclear programme. The UN said last week that Iran had temporarily halted most of its uranium enrichment work earlier this month. The West fears Iran's ultimate goal is to build nuclear weapons. Iran says its programme is aimed solely at peaceful energy use. ""They succeeded in creating problems for a limited number of our centrifuges with the software they had installed in electronic parts,"" Mr Ahmadinejad told a news conference.  ""Our specialists stopped that and they will not be able to do it again,"" he added without elaborating on the software thought to have been used. The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency said in a report last week that a temporary stoppage had hit Iran's Natanz enrichment nuclear plant earlier this month. Experts say the worm, which Iran said in September had attacked its computers, has been specially configured to damage motors commonly used in uranium-enrichment centrifuges by sending them spinning out of control.  The computer virus is a form of customised malware, written to attack a precise target. Analysts say the complexity of the code suggests it was created by a ""nation state"" in the West, rather than an organised crime group.  Senior Iranian officials have said that the virus is evidence that an ""electronic war"" has been launched against the country. Mr Ahmadinejad's comments about the cyber attack worm come on the day that a high-profile Iranian nuclear scientist was killed and another wounded in two separate but similar attacks in the capital.

Two months have passed since the chancellor told MPs there would be no cuts in the overall policing budget from 2016-17 to 2019-20, but there has been little recognition of just how significant that statement was.   It has subtly altered the political landscape, fundamentally changed policing priorities and is set to shape the law and order agenda for the media.  The Spending Review announcement came 12 days after the attacks in Paris, which led to a debate about whether cuts to neighbourhood policing would erode intelligence-gathering and if UK police firearms units had the capacity and capability to respond to an attack by marauding gunmen. Politically, it would have been very tricky for the chancellor to have gone ahead with a cuts programme without acknowledging those concerns, but he went far further than anyone expected.  The move outfoxed Labour, which had argued police could withstand cutbacks of no more than 10%.  They did not think the chancellor would settle for anything less than that and were planning a fresh onslaught of their anti-cuts campaign.   By design or default (and I veer towards the design theory), it also has placed Mr Osborne as the ""policeman's friend"".  media caption Chancellor rolls back on police cuts He is seen as the man who saved the 43 forces in England and Wales from cuts they feared would be in the region of 20-25%.   Why the chancellor would want to be cast in that role may have something to do with the unofficial contest to succeed David Cameron when he steps down as prime minister, though I am sure he would deny it.   Rivals for top job One of Mr Osborne's likely rivals is Theresa May, the Home Secretary, whose bold programme of policing changes and uncompromising style have made her deeply unpopular among the ranks of constables, sergeants and inspectors.   Mr Osborne's line towards the end of his statement: ""The police protect us, and we're going to protect the police,"" signalled a clear difference of tone from Mrs May. image copyright PA image caption Theresa May has outlined plans for change Indeed, in December, the home secretary  told chief constables and police and crime commissioners (PCCs)  she would not have ""any sympathy"" for those who complained about existing budget cuts and that the new funding package did not ""insulate"" them from the need to make further efficiencies.   ""It does not let you off the hook or mean you can slow the pace of change,"" she said. ""Now - more than ever before - there is no excuse not to deliver.""   Of course, there are still anxieties within policing circles about the effect of central government funding cuts imposed since 2010, and whether forces can handle the record number of sexual abuse cases they are having to investigate.   Revised proposals for a new funding formula, after the previous bungled attempt, will create losers as well as winners, reigniting the concerns.   But, overall, the media appetite for stories about police budgets is likely to dwindle. Instead, during the next five months, in the lead-up to the first PCC elections since November 2012, the focus will shift towards Mrs May's latest plans.  They include:  enhanced powers for police volunteers, which  I wrote about in November closer police working with other blue-light services giving PCCs greater responsibilities, in particular  over their local fire brigades a strengthened role for the Independent Police Complaints Commission There has also been renewed speculation about a review of counter-terrorism policing, which could see powers transferred from Scotland Yard to the National Crime Agency.    Outside influence Each proposal by itself may not be agenda-setting or eye-catching.   But the theme is clear.  It represents a further loosening of the grip traditional police structures have had on law enforcement and a recognition that those outside the service have a vital part to play.   The issue that may well dominate the PCC election campaign, however, is crime.  The last set of data, published in October 2015, suggested  more than seven million frauds and cybercrimes  had been committed in England and Wales in the 12 months to the end of June.  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Cybercrime is a growing problem It was the first time there had been an estimate of fraud and online offences by the Office for National Statistics.   If added to the authoritative Crime Survey, which has been showing a decline in overall offending rates for two decades, fraud would add 5.1 million offences to the total and computer hacking an extra 2.5 million, somewhat blunting the government's proud message that ""crime is falling"".  What may well have happened is that criminals have switched from burgling houses, stealing cars and robbing people to swindling us online. Cybercrime and fraud: Fraud:  5,110,000 cases - 3,757,000 victims Fraud with loss (including those reimbursed):2,648,000 cases - 2,079,000 victims Fraud no loss: 2,462,000 cases - 1,856,000 victims Computer misuse: 2,460,00 cases - 2,113,000 victims Unauthorised access to personal information (including hacking): 404,000 cases - 404,000 victims Computer virus: 2,057,000 cases - 1,741,000 victims      Source: National Office for Statistics, year ending June 2015 All this has placed fraud and cyber-crime firmly on the law-and-order map, a position that will be cemented in July, when the numbers are automatically included in the Crime Survey, and then in October when provisional year-on-year comparisons become possible.  There are also tentative signs that incidents of violence, recorded by police, may be increasing too, with knife possession up 9% and murders at their highest level for four years.  Police figures, which rely on the public reporting offences and police recording them accurately, must be treated with caution, but the next set of data, published on 21 January, is keenly awaited.

Ali Akbar Salehi said the apparent delay at the Bushehr reactor had nothing to do with the Stuxnet computer worm, but gave no other explanation. The Russian-built plant was inaugurated in August after several years of delay. It will be internationally supervised. It is not seen by analysts as posing a significant proliferation risk. The process of placing fuel rods at the Bushehr facility would be completed in early November, Mr Salehi, who heads the Iranian Atomic Energy Organisation, said on Wednesday. ""Two or three months from then, the electricity generated by the plant will be connected to the grid,"" he added, pushing the timeframe to early 2011, not November as originally announced. He has previously blamed the fuelling delays on ""severe hot weather"", and insisted on Wednesday that the plant was no longer being affected by the sophisticated Stuxnet computer virus that Iran's foreign ministry has described a ""new game of soft warfare"" by the country's enemies. ""We implemented measures to protect our computers last year, but during the past two months, these [cyber attack] activities increased dramatically,"" Mr Salehi said on state radio. ""Fortunately, we were able to neutralise the enemy's objective without involving the media. The fact these activities are continuing smoothly is evidence of this,"" he added. Security experts say the worm may have been a state-sponsored attack on Iran's nuclear programme that originated in the United States or Israel. Iran says it needs the Bushehr plant, under construction since the 1970s, to meet growing demand for electricity. Officials say it will generate 1,000 megawatts, about 2.5% of the country's power usage when it is up and running. Iran has been subject to four rounds of UN sanctions because of its uranium enrichment programme, which is separate from Bushehr. The West fears Tehran wants to build a nuclear weapon, but Iran insists its plans are for peaceful energy production.

But there are warnings that the recent Facebook craze could actually be a risk to our online security. The first gig you went to is often one of the security questions which banks and other organisations ask when setting up an account - and revealing that information online, even in an innocent online post, could make you more vulnerable to hackers. ""I wouldn't do it,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, from the University of Surrey. ""But it's difficult to tell people not to take part, as it is part of their social interaction and has become the norm. ""What I would say is to think very carefully about what you are putting into the public domain."" MP asks Facebook to tackle ""fake news"" as election approaches Google and Facebook duped in huge ""scam"" Facebook ""most secure"" for instant messaging, says Amnesty Zuckerberg's social media accounts targeted by hackers Prof Angela Sasse, director of the UK Research Institute in Science of Cyber-security, said she feels that the companies are to blame for any security breach rather than individuals. ""The risk is not so much publishing these lists, rather that somebody thinks it is a good idea to use questions like that as security credentials,"" she told the BBC. ""Companies are violating the security principle that the way of authenticating people should be private - such as a password or Pin number - rather than something that is publicly available."" People are often warned not to post their holiday photos on social media sites in case it alerts potential burglars to the fact that their house is unoccupied. However, Prof Woodward said it is very difficult to prove if homes are targeted as a result of people showing their friends a picture of themselves on the beach. ""It is practically impossible to correlate numbers of burglaries of holidaymakers who are active on social media - but what is clear is the more personal information you put out there, the more is likely to be used by hackers."" 'Not stupid' There had been some suggestions that the concerts question had been set up by the criminal underworld, but Prof Woodward dismissed that theory. He told the BBC: ""This is not something that cyber-criminals would concoct - but they are not stupid and they will see the potential in it. ""It is better for them to co-opt on to something that is part of the mainstream rather than produce something new, as people tend not to trust new things."" You might think that turning up your Facebook privacy settings may eliminate the risk in sharing a list of your favourite gigs - but Prof Woodward is not so sure. ""How do you know the list you are responding to actually comes from who says it comes from?"" he said. ""You think you know who are you talking to but you can't be 100% certain. If my email account gets hacked, my friends get emails apparently from me asking for some information. The same sort of thing could potentially happen with these lists."" Prof Sasse added: ""The privacy settings are too complex and when privacy policies change, people often have to do it all over again which doesn't help them."" Facebook's top six security tips to keep your account safe: Protect your password Use Facebook's security features Make sure your email account(s) are secure Log out of Facebook when using a shared computer Run anti-virus software on your computer Think before you click or download anything Source:  Facebook  Security for online accounts is becoming more sophisticated, however, and Prof Woodward said there are easy ways for people to improve their personal safety on the web. ""One thing banks and other companies can do is get you to specify the question you need to answer to access your account, rather than using stock questions. ""Two-factor authentication is an obvious way of making accounts more secure. A lot of banks make it available, but not everybody turns it on - in some cases it is only an option, but I think it will increasingly be there by default. ""People should also use a password manager that will generate proper strong passwords which will also mean they are not using the same password for their accounts. ""The best password is one you can't remember.""

An  unidentified programmer  has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up. In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer. The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265).  It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work.  Scrambling schemes Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer  in seven seconds .  But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive.  And Mr Abrams said: ""Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task.""  This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said. Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the  website set up to help people  unlock their computer. Independent security analyst Graham Cluley said there had been other occasions when ransomware makers had ""bungled"" their encryption system. Cryptolocker, Linux.encoder and one other ransomware variant were all rendered harmless when their scrambling schemes were reverse-engineered. ""Of course,"" said Mr Cluley, ""the best thing is to have safety secured backups rather than relying upon ransomware criminals goofing up.""

The efforts were directed against individuals in Iran and 12 other countries, including the UK and US, Check Point said. It said the two groups involved were using new techniques to install spyware on targets' PCs and mobile devices. And this was then being used to steal call recordings and media files. One of the groups, known as Domestic Kitten or APT-50, is accused of tricking people into downloading malicious software on to mobile phones by a variety of means including: repackaging an existing version of an authentic video game found on the Google Play store mimicking an app for a restaurant in Tehran offering a fake mobile-security app providing a compromised app that publishes articles from a local news agency supplying an infected wallpaper app containing pro-Islamic State imagery masquerading as an Android application store to download further software The American-Israeli company's researchers documented 1,200 victims being targeted by the campaign, living in seven countries. There had been more than 600 successful infections, it said. The second group, known as Infy or Prince Of Persia, is said to spy on the home and work PCs of dissidents in 12 countries, extracting sensitive data after tricking people into opening malicious email attachments. The Iranian government has not commented on the report. Furball malware Domestic Kitten's operation was first identified in 2018. And Check Point said there was evidence it had run at least 10 campaigns since 2017. Four of these were still active, with the most recent beginning in November 2020.  And it was using an Iranian blog site, Telegram channels and text messages to lure people into installing its infected software, which the researchers have dubbed Furball, which could: record calls and other sounds track the device's location collect device identifiers, grab text messages and call logs steal media files, including videos and photos, obtain a list of other installed applications steal files from external storage The 600 successful infections are said to have included dissidents, opposition forces and people belonging to the Kurdish ethnic minority in: Iran the US Great Britain Pakistan Afghanistan Turkey Uzbekistan The other group, Infy, is said to have been operating as far back as 2007.  Its most recent activity had targeted PCs, with fake emails with attractive content, usually with an attached document, Check Point said. One example provided was of a document apparently about loans being offered to disabled veterans. image copyright Check Point image caption One infected document appeared to be from the Iranian-government-sponsored Foundation of Martyrs and Veterans Affairs Once the document was opened, a spying tool was installed and sensitive data stolen, the company said. Two documents recently used are said to have included a photo of an Iranian governor, with alleged contact details. The researchers said Infy's capabilities were ""far superior"" to most other known Iranian campaigns, thanks to its ability to be highly selective about its targets and to have generally have gone undetected. ""It is clear that the Iranian government is investing significant resources into cyber-operations,"" Check Point cyber-research head Yaniv Balmas said.

Details of the alleged hack targeting 36 members of staff, including TV anchors and executives, have been published in  a report by Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto . It says a vulnerability in iPhone operating system software was used. NSO Group has denied the allegation, saying it âlacks any evidence"". Citizen Lab researchers say they concluded with âmedium confidenceâ that two attackers who had spied on the phones of Al Jazeera journalists were doing so on behalf of the Saudi Arabian and UAE governments. âThe phones were compromised using an exploit chain that we call Kismet,â the researchers write. In July 2020, Kismet was a ""zero-day"" attack - meaning Apple was supposedly unaware of the flaw - and it worked on at least iOS 13.5.1, and could hack Appleâs iPhone 11, the latest model at the time. Pegasus spyware Citizen Lab was first alerted to potential spying activity on the journalistsâ phones when contacted by Tamer Almisshal, an investigative filmmaker at Al Jazeera. Mr Almisshal had expressed concerns that his iPhone had been hacked and so allowed Citizen Lab to monitor activity on the device. âWe noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an Installation Server for NSO Groupâs Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,â the Citizen Lab researchers allege in their report. Hitting back at the allegations, a spokesman for NSO Group said: âThis memo is based once again on speculation and lacks any evidence supporting a connection to NSO.â He added that the firm provided software to governments, who used it tackle serious organised crime and terrorism, and did not operate the software itself. NSO Group would continue âto work tirelessly to make the world a safer placeâ, he added. Firm 'impersonated Facebook to spread spyware' Israeli spyware firm pitches to be Covid-19 saviour WhatsApp sues Israeli firm over hacking claims The exploit described by the Citizen Lab team fails to work on iPhones running iOS 14, the latest version. Users should update to this version immediately, the researchers said. A spokesman for Apple added that iOS 14 was âa major leap forwardâ in protecting against such attacks. âThe attack described in the research was highly targeted by nation states against specific individuals,â he said. âWe always urge customers to download the latest version of the software to protect themselves and their data.â The BBC has contacted Al Jazeera and the London embassies of Saudi Arabia and the UAE for comment.

An investigation from news site Motherboard claims a Facebook security lookalike domain was set up to spread NSO's Pegasus hacking tool. It also claimed to have found evidence that servers inside the United States were used to spread the spying tool. NSO denies the allegations, labelling them ""recycled conjecture"". The Pegasus spyware, once installed, can read text messages and other data on the phone, track its location with GPS, and access the microphone and camera.  The Israeli firm is already locked in a legal battle with Facebook, which alleges it deliberately spread its software over WhatsApp, compromising hundreds of phones - including those of journalists and human rights activists. It is also, separately, accused of supplying software to the Saudi government which was allegedly used to spy on journalist Jamal Khashoggi before he was killed. Facebook's complaint alleged NSO operated the spyware itself. But NSO has asked the court in California to dismiss the case, in part because it says it never uses its spyware - only sovereign governments do.  WhatsApp sues Israeli firm over hacking claims Israeli spyware firm pitches to be Covid-19 saviour Motherboard's latest investigation  revolves around a former NSO employee who, it is claimed, provided it with details of a server allegedly designed to distribute the spyware by tricking people into clicking links. The server investigated was connected to several different web addresses over a number of years - including one that impersonated Facebook's security team, the Motherboard report claims. Facebook told the BBC it had gained ownership of the domain in question four years ago, to stop it being misused.  Other domains used over time included ""a link a person could click on to unsubscribe themselves from emails or text messages... and package tracking links from FedEx,"" Motherboard reports. 'Tackling terrorism' But NSO fiercely denies that it has ever used its products itself. ""We are incredibly proud of our technology's role in tackling crime and terrorism, but NSO does not operate any of its products,"" a spokesman said in a statement. ""As we have repeatedly made clear, NSO products are offered to and operated solely by verified and authorised government agencies."" Motherboard also alleged that one of the servers used to launch the malware was located within the United States - something that NSO says is not possible.  Facebook has previously made similar allegations in the WhatsApp legal case. ""We stand by our previous statements that NSO Group products cannot be used to conduct cyber-surveillance within the United States, and no customer has ever been granted technology that enables targeting phones with US numbers,"" a spokesman said.  Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said the possibility of US-based servers being used to deploy the spyware raised ""more questions than answers"". ""They appear to have some sort of infrastructure in the US,"" Prof Woodward said. ""The question is whether the US government is aware of it."" A Facebook spokesperson said: ""NSO Group is responsible for cyber-attacks against human rights activists, journalists, and diplomats, in violation of US law.  ""We are committed to protecting the security of our community and are seeking to hold them accountable in court."" NSO said its official stance remained that which it had put forward in the legal case with Facebook. ""Revisiting and recycling the conjecture of NSO's detractors... doesn't change the overall truth of our position, which we have stated to the US Federal Court in California,"" it said. ""Factual assertions on all the above have been provided as part of the official court record, and we do not have anything else to add at this time.""

NSO Group says it is in talks with governments around the world, and claims some are already testing it. The surveillance software-maker is being sued by WhatsApp for allegedly sending malware to the phones of human rights activists and journalists. It has  denied that allegation ""in the strongest possible terms"" . The company also faces a lawsuit  in which it is accused of supplying software to the Saudi government, which the country is said to have used to spy on the journalist Jamal Khashoggi before his murder.  Last year, NSO responded to that claim by saying that its products were ""licensed for the sole use of providing governments and law enforcement agencies the ability to lawfully fight terrorism and crime"". But now, it is pitching its tools as a means to help better understand how coronavirus is spreading. ""The software is here to solve a global pandemic,"" a spokesman told the BBC.  ""This is about giving governments the ability to understand the situation they're facing and make informed decisions. It's a really powerful piece of software.""  NSO says its employees will not have access to any data, but its software will work best if a government asks local mobile phone operators to provide the records of every subscriber in the country.  Each person known to be infected with Covid-19 could then be tracked, with the people they had met and the places they had visited, even before showing symptoms, plotted on a map. image copyright Twitter image caption Israel's defence minister tweeted this image of NSO's user interface last week But John Scott Railton, of the Toronto-based privacy watchdog Citizen Lab, said governments would be foolish to use the system. ""The last thing that we need is a secretive company claiming to solve a pandemic while refusing to say who its clients are,"" he said. Cluster forecasts NSO gave the BBC a demonstration of how its system works, via a video conference link.  A heat map of Israel showed hotspots where there were a high number of cases of the virus.  Zooming in, individual phones of people with the infection were mapped, and represented by an anonymised ID number. Details were also shown of other phones they had encountered and the relevant times and locations. The engineer demonstrating the system said that it could be used to: predict where the next cluster of cases was likely to be when to move ventilators to hospitals most in need when to allow certain regions of a country to come out of quarantine NSO said a number of governments around the world were piloting the system, but would not reveal their identity or whether any of them had started using it in the field. A SIMPLE GUIDE:   How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:  The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:  Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:  Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:  The 20-second hand wash A spokesman added that the firm had made it a requirement that the authorities involved were operating in compliance with Europe's GDPR privacy law or their own data protection rules. Software requiring mobile networks to hand over customer data represents a very different approach from the contact-tracing apps being considered in the UK and many other European countries.  Such apps, would use a phone's Bluetooth connection to alert users if they had been in contact with someone infected with the virus, and would almost certainly be voluntary to download. Citizen Lab previously investigated NSO's Pegasus software. It found evidence that it had been secretly installed on the phones of journalists and dissidents in countries from Mexico to the Middle East.   ""NSO has shown that it is uniquely capable of damaging public trust,"" said Mr Railton. ""I can't think of a better brand name to make citizens nervous about a governmental tracking effort."" There has been controversy in Israel over a separate project which could see its defence ministry work with NSO Group to assess the likelihood that individual citizens might spread the coronavirus. Defence minister Naftali Bennet proposed giving NSO access to highly sensitive data about citizens collected by the Shin Bet security services. But Israeli lawmakers attacked the plan, warning that handing data to a private company raised serious concerns.

WhatsApp  filed a lawsuit against NSO Group  on Wednesday, alleging it was behind cyber-attacks that infected devices in April and May. The Israeli company, which makes software for surveillance, has strongly disputed the allegations. India has 400 million WhatsApp users, making the country its biggest market.

After discovering the cyber-attacks in May, WhatsApp quickly rolled out a fix, adding ""new protections"" to their systems and issuing updates. Cyber experts at Toronto-based internet watchdog Citizen Lab helped WhatsApp identify cases where the suspected targets of this attack were members of civil society, such as human rights defenders or journalists. Citizen Lab said it had identified more than 100 cases of ""abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe, ranging from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America"". image copyright Getty Images image caption India has 400 million WhatsApp users, making the country the service's biggest market.

Mr Woog said the service had contacted each of the people targeted and informed them about the cyber attack. WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are encrypted end-to-end. This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device. The firm, which was acquired by Facebook in 2014, said this was the first time an encrypted messaging provider had taken legal action of this kind.

Working with mobile security firm Lookout, researchers discovered that malware in fake messaging designed to look like WhatsApp and Signal had stolen gigabytes of data. Targets included military personnel, activists, journalists and lawyers. Researchers say they traced the malware to a Lebanese government building. The threat, dubbed Dark Caracal by the researchers, looks as if it could come from a nation state and appears to use shared infrastructure linked to other nation-state hackers,  the report said. The malware takes advantage of known exploits and targets mainly Android phones. Data was traced back to a server in a building belonging to the Lebanese General Security Directorate in Beirut, according to researchers. ""Based on the available evidence, it is likely that the GDGS is associated with or directly supporting the actors behind Dark Caracal,"" the report said.

The researchers believe Dark Caracal has been operating since 2012 but it has been hard to track because of the diversity of seemingly unrelated espionage campaigns originating from the same domain names. Over the years Dark Caracal's work has been repeatedly misattributed to other cybercrime groups, the researchers said. In November, Afghanistan moved to ban WhatsApp and Telegram as a way to stop insurgent groups from using encrypted messaging. And in December, Iran moved to restrict use of the apps after a series of anti-establishment protests. Use of an app that can steal data would give nation states much more information than simply banning them, said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""It is always hard to prove that a nation state is involved. During the Cold War, countries made use of mercenaries and that's what we are seeing online now."" He said it was unclear where the infected apps had been downloaded from. ""Google is saying that they were not downloaded from there but it is difficult to know where else they came from. It may be that people are getting suckered into something that looks like an official site. People need to be careful what they are downloading.""

The software was reportedly stolen from a security firm called NSO Group, known for creating surveillance software.  The former NSO developer is believed to have stolen the code after learning he was going to be sacked. Israel's Justice Ministry said if the sale had gone ahead it could have harmed state security. Security cracked In a statement, the ministry said the accused was a senior programmer at NSO who had access to the firm's development systems including its stores of source code. The ministry said once the programmer had downloaded company code, he posed as a hacker and sought to sell the software on dark web markets. It is claimed that he asked for a payment of $50m to be made in crypto-cash to make it harder to trace.  The unidentified individual who agreed to buy the software contacted NSO before the deal went ahead. A sting was set up and the suspected thief was arrested. Daily newspaper Israel Hayom  reported that the indictment  against the former NSO employee said: ""The defendant's âactions seriously jeopardised the NSO Group and âcould have led to its collapse."" The programmer has been charged with theft, intent to compromise national security, pursuing an unlicensed defence transaction and disruption of a computer system. A statement released by the defendant's legal team said its client ""never tried to undermine national security"". They added: â""We believe the court will get to the truth in this âcase. We will prove these allegations to be âdisproportionate and baseless."" NSO âGroup came to prominence in 2016 after being  accused of creating software  that can overcome security protections on Apple iPhones.  NSO software has also been implicated in a  long-running spyware scandal  in Mexico. In response, NSO has said it only sells to authorised agencies and has no control over the way its tools are used.

An internet watchdog based in Canada, Citizen Lab, said the surveillance software is only sold to governments. Last week, Citizen Lab also said that 12 journalists and human rights lawyers had been targeted.  At the time, the Mexican President, Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto, described accusations that the government was involved as false.  Mr PeÃ±a Nieto said surveillance software was only used for matters of national security and for fighting organised crime. He added that he had ordered an investigation by the attorney general's office.  Citizen Lab said the head of the Conservative National Action Party (PAN), Ricardo Anaya, a PAN Senator, Roberto Gil Zuarth, and the party's communications secretary, Fernando Rodriguez, were targeted.  ""There is strong circumstantial evidence implicating the government of Mexico"", the watchdog said.   The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by the Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists. It is usually sent in a text message to a smartphone.  If the person taps on it, the spyware is installed, and huge amounts of private data - text messages, photos, emails, location data, even what is being picked up by the device's microphone and camera - are hacked.

A newly-released US CIA report has  implicated Mohammed bin Salman  in the death of the Saudi journalist, who was killed in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Bryan Fogel's film The Dissident explores what happened to Khashoggi and who might have ordered his murder. His body has never been recovered and the Saudi crown prince has denied involvement. In November 2019, five men were tried and sentenced to death in a Saudi court for Khashoggi's killing and three others were jailed. The death sentences were later commuted to 20 years in prison. Using transcripts obtained from the Turkish government, Fogel's film suggests that Khashoggi, a journalist for the Washington Post who had exiled himself to the US, was suffocated and then dismembered inside the consulate. The film also investigates the use of spyware and phone hacking against Saudi activists living in exile. These include Canada-based video blogger Omar Abdulaziz, with whom Khashoggi was in close contact before his death. Biden raises human rights in call with Saudi king What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? ""I don't believe the crown prince is ever going to face an Interpol arrest warrant that'll pick him up when he lands his private jet somewhere and haul him off to The Hague or extradite him to Istanbul or the US,"" says Fogel. ""That's never going to happen.  ""This is the environment that we find ourselves in, which is constantly in conflict with human rights. Leaders like Mohammed bin Salman see their money can buy their way out of these sorts of events, and there isn't accountability unless there's a cumulative and combined effort from countries."" image copyright Reuters image caption Mohammed bin Salman was made crown prince by his father King Salman in 2017 Fogel says he welcomes a re-evaluation of ties between the US and Saudi Arabia under the Biden administration, citing the close relationship the two countries had during Donald Trump's presidency. ""Biden's definitely not following the playbook of Donald Trump,"" the US director comments. ""Signing off [on] the declassification and releasing the CIA findings into Khashoggi's murder is a blow to US-Saudi relations."" According to Fogel, the recent release of human rights activist Loujain al-Hathloul after almost three years in detention is ""clearly a peace offering to the Biden administration"". Released Saudi activist's family 'want justice' Saudi woman activist jailed despite global outcry ""There appears to be support from both Democrats and Republicans to re-examine the relationship with Saudi Arabia in the light of the war in Yemen, so time will tell,"" he continues. Fogel's last investigative film, Icarus, won an Oscar in 2018 for exposing the scandal of state-sponsored Russian doping in athletics. The Dissident was also critically acclaimed following its world premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in 2020, yet Fogel queries why global streaming services including Amazon and Netflix have not bought the film for their platforms.  ""I think the film lays bare that unfortunately there is a contrition and a cowardice amongst these huge companies to take on subject matter that might affect their shareholder value, or their business or investor interests, even though they know hundreds of millions of people would be interested in watching the film,"" he argues. image copyright Altitude Films image caption Video blogger Omar Abdulaziz gives revealing testimony in Fogel's film Fogel is also critical of Amazon owner Jeff Bezos, the world's richest person, who also owns the Washington Post, the newspaper that employed Khashoggi. ""He chose not to acquire this film for global distribution on his platform,"" Fogel says. ""But a few months later, he acquired Souq, the so-called Amazon of Saudi Arabia."" Amazon actually acquired Souq.com in 2017 , subsequently rebranding it as Amazon.ae. ""Is Amazon still doing business with Saudi Arabia? Yes,"" says Fogel. ""Is he actually standing up for the murder of his employee? He's certainly made some statements, but actions speak louder than words."" Fogel's film includes footage of a 2017 vigil held near the Saudi consulate in Istanbul which Bezos attended and spoke at. image copyright Altitude Films image caption Hatice Cengiz (right) has accused Saudi Arabia's crown prince of ordering her fiancÃ©e's killing ""I'm not mad at any of these companies,"" the director goes on. ""It's business. But it's disappointing as this sort of behaviour eventually allows murders like Jamal Khashoggi's to happen, and when there's no standing up for content like this it becomes increasingly difficult for filmmakers like myself. But I'm optimistic that the climate will change."" The aim of The Dissident, its director says, is not to make ""an archival film"". ""It's to make a living, breathing thriller that looks deeply into Khashoggi's murder and the ramifications of it,"" he contends. Fogel also interviews Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Turkish scientist Hatice Cengiz, as well as Omar Abdulaziz, whose activism was financially supported by Khashoggi. Khashoggi fiancee sues Saudi crown prince Saudi court commutes Khashoggi death sentences The film puts forward the theory that this act may have tipped Jamal Khashoggi into being viewed as an activist and dissident himself, rather than just an outspoken journalist. ""But I think even in the final weeks of Jamal's life he never saw himself as a dissident,"" Fogel argues. ""He was holding onto the notion that he was a journalist. Yet what you see in the film is that the work he was doing and what he was writing about made him one, at least as we understand it. ""Jamal Khashoggi was someone who wanted to make his country a better place and was silenced in the most horrific way,"" Fogel concludes. ""In the film, you'll see that the choice he faced was either to stay in Saudi Arabia and be silent, or leave Saudi, risk his life and go into exile and speak truth to power. It cost him his life.""

The Israeli-made spyware was only sold to governments, according to Citizen Lab, which is based in Canada. Mexican journalists, human rights activists and opposition politicians have made similar allegations.  Mexico's government denies using the spyware to snoop on its opponents. It says it has only used intelligence tools in the interest of national security or to fight organised crime. The  students, from an all-male college in the southern town of Ayotzinapa , were declared dead after disappearing in 2014 in the south-western state of Guerrero.  Their relatives have accused the authorities of a cover-up. Some Mexicans have held out hope that members of the group may yet be found alive.  Who are the latest alleged targets?  The foreign experts, convened by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, were called in to investigate the disappearance of the students. The team has repeatedly accused the Mexican government of blocking their work. Mexican politicians 'targeted by spyware' Government âhacked criticsâ phones' Mexico missing students: Knowns and unknowns Citizen Lab, which is based at the University of Toronto,  says in its analysis  that it has found forensic evidence to show that the investigators' mobile phones were being targeted by Israeli-made spyware. One member, Spanish investigator Carlos Beristain, said the attempt to install spyware could be a ""more serious crime given the diplomatic protected status"" the group held.  Attempts to infect their devices reportedly took place in March 2016, shortly after the group accused the Mexican government of  hampering its inquiry , and as they were preparing a final report.  How does the spyware work? The software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by the Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists. It is usually sent in a text message to a smartphone. If the person taps on it, the spyware is installed, and huge amounts of private data - including text messages, photos, emails, location data, the device's microphone and camera - are hacked. image copyright AFP / Getty Images  image caption Mexican journalist Carmen Aristegui is another alleged target; she says her investigative team and under-age son also received messages One message sent to investigators in March was from someone pretending to pass on personal information about a funeral. ""Here are the details. I hope you can come,"" it read.  According to  the New York Times , the same link was sent last year to an academic trying to impose a sugar tax in Mexico and, in that case, the message was confirmed as a Pegasus trick.  Mr Beristain said he had received the message but had not opened it as he suspected some form of espionage.   Who are the missing students'?  On the evening of 26 September 2014, a group of 43 Mexican students disappeared in Guerrero.  They had been studying at an all-male teacher training college that has a history of left-wing activism. image copyright Reuters image caption Relatives and activists holding up portraits of the missing at one of the many protests Before they disappeared, the students reportedly clashed with municipal police while on their way to a protest.  Police opened fire on their buses .  According to the official government report, the group was then handed over by corrupt officers to members of a local drugs gang. The government version of events says their bodies were burnt in a fire at a rubbish dump. Authorities identified one student, Alexander Mora, from charred bone they said they had found at the site, and they partially identified another.   The international investigators have disputed the fire theory, saying they have yet to find sufficient evidence.  The Mexican attorney general has  declared them all dead  but their relatives still want proof of what happened that night, and justice.  The case is so well known in the country and across Latin America that the students are widely known simply as ""The 43"".

spyware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-40261693|"Apple Mac computers targeted by ransomware and spyware By Mark Ward Technology correspondent, BBC News Published 13 June 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Apple Mac computers are being targeted by two types of malware being spread on the ""dark web"" Mac users are being warned about new variants of malware that have been created specifically to target Apple computers. One is ransomware that encrypts data and demands payment before files are released. The other is spyware that watches what users do and scoops up valuable information. Experts said they represented a threat because their creators were letting anyone use them for free. The two programs were uncovered by the security firms Fortinet and AlienVault, which found a portal on the Tor ""dark web"" network that acted as a shopfront for both. In a blog,  Fortinet said the site claimed  that the creators behind it were professional software engineers with ""extensive experience"" of creating working code. Those wishing to use either of the programs had been urged to get in touch and provide details of how they wanted the malware to be set up. The malware's creators had said that payments made by ransomware victims would be split between themselves and their customers. Researchers at Fortinet contacted the ransomware writers pretending they were interested in using the product and, soon afterwards, were sent a sample of the malware. Analysis revealed that it used much less sophisticated encryption than the many variants seen targeting Windows machines, said the firm. image copyright Reuters image caption NHS computers were hit by a high-profile ransomware attack last month However, they added, any files scrambled with the ransomware would be completely lost because it did a very poor job of handling the decryption keys needed to restore data. ""Even if it is far inferior to most current ransomware targeting Windows, it doesn't fail to encrypt victim's files or prevent access to important files, thereby causing real damage,"" wrote the researchers. The free Macspy spyware, offered via the same site, can log which keys are pressed, take screenshots and tap into a machine's microphone.  In its analysis, AlienVault researcher Peter Ewane  said the malicious code  in the spyware tried hard to evade many of the standard ways security programs spot and stop such programs. Mr Ewane said Mac users needed to start being more vigilant as malware creators targeted them. ""As OS X continues to grow in market share we can expect malware authors to invest greater amounts of time in producing malware for this platform."" Statistics gathered by McAfee  suggest that there are now about 450,000 malicious programs aimed at Macs - far fewer than the 23 million targeting Windows users. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Aamir Lakhani from Fortinet said Mac users should make sure their machines were kept up to date with the latest software patches and be wary of messages they receive via email. ""Mac ransomware is definitely becoming bigger,""  he told EWeek . ""Although market share is still small, hackers know that there is valuable data on the Mac.""

The script in the site targeted visitors using the anonymising web browser Tor and sent information about their computers to a server in France. The code may have been written by a law enforcement agency and there are fears it could have been used on other sites to track law-abiding people. An update to the Tor browser has disabled the tracker. Tor is designed to let people access pages from the so-called dark web and browse free from surveillance. But the hidden code in the illicit website exploited a security flaw in Tor to send user information back to a mysterious server in France. media caption Technology explained: What is the dark web? The vulnerability also affected the Mozilla's Firefox browser, on which Tor is based. Technology news site  Motherboard found  online posts referring to the discovery of the tracking code on the child sex abuse website. 'Government hacking' One user described the code as a network investigative technique (Nit), which can be used by law enforcement to help identify people browsing the web anonymously. The website in question was shut down on 15 November. The party behind the tracking code has not been identified, but one security researcher told news site  Ars Technica  that a majority of the code matched a script deployed by the FBI in 2013. Daniel Veditz, security lead at Firefox-maker Mozilla,  said in a blog : ""The exploit in this case works in essentially the same way as the 'network investigative technique' used by [the] FBI to deanonymise Tor users. ""This similarity has led to speculation that this exploit was created by FBI or another law enforcement agency.  As of now, we do not know whether this is the case. ""If this exploit was in fact developed and deployed by a government agency, the fact that it has been published and can now be used by anyone to attack Firefox users is a clear demonstration of how supposedly limited government hacking can become a threat to the broader web.""

The discovery was made after a human rights lawyer alerted security researchers to unsolicited text messages he had received. They discovered  three previously unknown flaws  within Apple's code. Apple has since  released a software update  that addresses the problem. The two security firms involved, Citizen Lab and Lookout, said they had held back details of the discovery until the fix had been issued. Rare attack media caption Human rights lawyer tells BBC's Today about the hack attempt The lawyer, Ahmed Mansoor, received the text messages on 10 and 11 August. The texts promised to reveal ""secrets"" about people allegedly being tortured in the United Arab Emirates (UAE)'s jails if he tapped the links. Had he done so, Citizen Lab says, his iPhone 6 would have been ""jailbroken"", meaning unauthorised software could have been installed. ""Once infected, Mansoor's phone would have become a digital spy in his pocket, capable of employing his iPhone's camera and microphone to snoop on activity in the vicinity of the device, recording his WhatsApp and Viber calls, logging messages sent in mobile chat apps, and tracking his movements,"" said Citizen Lab. ""We are not aware of any previous instance of an iPhone remote jailbreak used in the wild as part of a targeted attack campaign, making this a rare find."" The researchers say they believe the spyware involved was created by NSO Group, an Israeli ""cyber-war"" company. image copyright Citizenlab image caption The spyware would have been installed if Mansoor had tapped on the links ""[It is] the most sophisticated spyware package we've seen,"" said Lookout. ""It takes advantage of how integrated mobile devices are in our lives and the combination of features only available on mobile - always connected (wi-fi, 3G/4G), voice communications, camera, email, messaging, GPS, passwords, and contact lists.""  Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This is in many ways a textbook case of the cybersecurity community acting precisely as it should. Researchers were alerted to a vulnerability, investigated it, and made Apple, the company responsible for fixing it, aware so it could issue a fix. Apple, to its credit, understood the severity and acted quickly - it took them just 10 days.  These types of vulnerabilities are rare and extremely lucrative. A genuine ""zero day"" - the name given to previously unknown security flaws - can be sold for upwards of $1m when it affects a major piece of software like Apple's iOS. In this case, it looks like several zero days were combined to make a hugely sophisticated attack package.  Now attention is shifting to the secretive organisation said to be behind the attack, the NSO Group, described by researchers as a cyber arms dealer, and described by itself as firm capable of being a ""ghost"" on victims' devices - working undetected but gathering enormous amounts of private data.  According to Privacy International, NSO Group has sold its products to clients in Mexico and in Panama - but little is known about other deals involving the company which is said to be worth more than $1bn.  Pressure is also being put on Francisco Partners Ltd, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm that has a controlling stake in NSO Group. It is yet to comment on the controversial attack. NSO has issued a statement acknowledging that it makes technology used to ""combat terror and crime"" but said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents and made no reference to the specific spyware involved. ""These are rather rare zero-day flaws,"" commented security expert Prof Alan Woodward, referring to the technical name for previously unknown vulnerabilities. ""To have several found at once is even rarer. As can be seen from how these have been exploited to date, it represents a serious threat to the security and privacy of iOS users.  ""Apple has been remarkably responsive in providing fixes for these issues, so I would encourage any iOS users to update to the latest version of the operating system."" For its part, Apple has limited itself to saying: ""We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5. We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits.""

The company has since taken down the article.  The post was highlighted by a French youth LGBT rights group. L'Amicale des jeunes du Refuge's  thread  about Fireworld's article (in French) was retweeted by French Secretary of State for Equality MarlÃ¨ne Schiappa, who  wrote  that it showed that ""homophobia and sexism have their roots in the same gender stereotypes. We will fight them together"". In its online article, since removed, the firm said that ""family is fundamental. That's why the sexual orientation of your children, directly responsible for the continuation of your family, is very important to you"". The article went on to list the clues that might cause a parent to suspect that their son might be gay. The article makes no mention of female homosexuality.  They include ""taking good care of himself"", being more interested in reading and theatre than in football, being shy as a young boy, having certain piercings and liking female singers and divas. It then suggested a variety of ways to be sure, including ""monitoring his Facebook use"", seeing ""if he has visited gay forums"" and ""spying on his private messages"". image copyright Fireworld image caption The original post has been removed from Fireworld's website In  a response  to L'Amicale des jeunes du Refuge, Fireworld wrote that ""the article had the sole aim of improving search engine optimisation and was never intended to be read by humans"". ""We regret not having reflected on the consequences of this type of content..."" the firm emailed. ""We sincerely apologise to all those who may have felt offended by this content,"" it added. However,  the English language version of Fireworld's site  suggests a range of scenarios in which a potential customer might want to monitor someone else's computer, including ""control your teenage offspring's PC"", checking ""what your employees are doing"" and ""detecting infidelity in your marriage or relationship"". It is not legal in France to install spyware on someone else's computer in order to monitor it, without their knowledge. Fireworld points out to customers that they must comply with the law when using their products. However, it says, ""installing [its product] to make sure that your children are not endangering themselves on the Internet or on social networks, come[s] closer to being legal"".

Cases of a particular scam targeting shoppers, which often spikes at Christmas, have tripled this year. Criminals harvest personal information then buy items in someone else's name. Dark tips The so-called facility takeover fraud sees victims reveal personal or financial information to someone they believe is genuine, such as supposed bank staff.  Criminals then use this information to access bank or credit card accounts to order items in the victim's name. Online banking accounts can also be taken over as a result of phishing, spyware or malware scams on computers. Cifas - a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies - said its intelligence team had seen evidence of criminals charging each other for information on the dark web. This is the part of the internet that is invisible to search engines. Criminals have long shared so-called sucker lists, detailing people who they have previously tricked in a scam and could be potential victims again. image caption Details can be stolen in a variety of ways There were 7,461 reports in the retail sector from January to September recorded by Cifas, compared with 2,365 in the same period in 2019. There was also a big rise in cases of fraudsters using the same kind of scam to order mobile phones. Cifas said techniques used by criminals were becoming more sophisticated as they were finding new ways to circumvent security measures put in place by companies.  Beware Christmas parcel delivery scams, banks warn Banks 'too often blaming customers' for fraud Mike Haley, chief executive of Cifas, said: ""We often notice a spike in this activity over the festive period, and so I would urge everyone to remain vigilant if contacted by anyone claiming to be from an organisation they trust, such as a bank, mobile phone company or even the police."" Last month, banking trade body UK Finance warned criminals were using the cover of Christmas shopping deals to roll out data harvesting scams, attempting to prompt consumers to provide details through phishing emails. These messages often advertised cheap goods and could involve fraudsters impersonating genuine organisations and businesses. How to prevent fraud The Take Five to Stop Fraud campaign is urging people to: Stop: Taking a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information could keep you safe Challenge: Could it be fake?

Javier Luis started an online friendship with Catherine Zang in 2009. Her husband used WebWatcher spyware to track the pair's private emails and online chats over several months, as evidence for divorce proceedings. The US appeal court  has now ruled 2-1  that Mr Luis can sue the software firm Awareness Technologies. Mr Luis claims the software, which logged web history, searches, chat logs and email threads, illegally intercepted his communications with Ms Zang. Legal action by Mr Luis against Mr Zang and other unnamed parties has been settled. But Mr Luis pursued his case against Awareness after a district court initially dismissed his claims against the company. A caring relationship While the two never met in person, Mr Luis said he developed ""a caring relationship"" with Ms Zang.  Mr Zang grew suspicious that his wife was conversing with other men, and installed the WebWatcher software on a shared computer to intercept her messages in real time. He read copies of the messages on the WebWatcher servers, and used the information to divorce Ms Zang on terms favourable to him in 2010. image copyright Webwatcher image caption Information from WebWatcher's website on how to install the software WebWatcher is marketed as parental monitoring software for ensuring children are using technology appropriately. Its  terms of use  require that the software is only installed on devices belonging to the purchaser or with permission to monitor a phone or computer belonging to someone else. Awareness Technologies denied Mr Luis' assertions that it intercepted the communications - illegal under the US Wiretap Act - arguing it merely stored them as data. It claimed that the term intercept applied only to situations in which a device captures a communication ""either before [it] reaches the intended recipient or contemporaneous with the transmission not after it reaches the destination where it is placed in electronic storage.""  The court of appeals disagreed. It concluded that Mr Luis ""has indeed alleged enough facts to reasonably infer that Awareness intercepted his communications"". Awareness has been contacted for comment.  The case has now been sent back to the lower court for it to continue.

Mr Torrent said it was proof of ""political spying against political opponents"" in Spain. Madrid has denied the allegations. The Guardian and El Pais newspapers reported that Mr Torrent had been warned that his phone was targeted last year using Pegasus, an Israeli-made spyware tool. The makers of the tool say it is only sold to governments to track criminals and terrorists. Mr Torrent was warned about the spyware by researchers working with WhatsApp.  Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Torrent called for a full investigation into what happened. ""This is the first time that we have concrete confirmation of what many of us knew and had been denouncing... We knew that illegal practices were being directed against the independence cause. Now we have certain proof,"" he said. Catalan crisis in 300 words Catalonia's quarrel with Spain explained The office of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez denied the accusations.

Tracking and listening devices, often disguised as everyday objects, retail online for under Â£50 and are easy to install, says the  Digital-Trust . There are no official figures but ""digital abuse"" is often experienced by victims of domestic violence, it adds. People with abusive partners should also be wary of gadgets given to their children, the charity warns. ""Eighteen months ago I issued advice to domestic violence groups about fathers gifting smartphones or even allowing them to take them on access visits because it is so easy for abusers to use them as surveillance,"" said Jennifer Perry, chief executive of the newly formed Digital-Trust. ""I recommend children are given inexpensive pay as you go phones when visiting an abusive parent."" Ms Perry said incidents of digital abuse - ranging from surveillance to accessing voicemails, emails and cloud accounts, is escalating in the UK. In addition cheap surveillance devices - small GPS trackers, listening devices and cameras hidden inside books, lamps, plug sockets and carbon monoxide detectors, are freely available online despite some of them being illegal. ""If I have a domestic violence victim I assume there will be some type of digital abuse - it's not the exception, it's the assumption,"" she told the BBC. image copyright Roger Askew image caption Digital abuse is now very common for victims of domestic violence warns Digital-Trust chief executive Jennifer Perry Ms Perry added that in her experience it is more likely to happen to female victims. ""I get a lot of criticism for saying it but I don't see this level or type of surveillance used against male victims,"" she added. ""I see men using it against women. It is rare to see a man targeted surveillance-wise by women."" Ms Perry began working in the field of e-crime in 2005. She said that often victims need very specific advice, which is not easily available. ""Safety advice is often done by topic but if you don't know what you're looking for it doesn't help,"" she added. ""We'll ask a series of questions that deal with the symptoms - are you being harassed by your partner? Is he showing up where you are? Has he had access to your house or your PC?"" Smartphone owners may have not set up their device themselves so may not know what has been installed on it, she added. ""The main thing I try to do is stop any form of data leaking.

With a ""degree of technical competence rarely seen"", Regin had probably taken years to develop,  Symantec said .   And a nation state may have written it to serve its spying agencies' needs. The program had been used in ""systematic spying campaigns"" over the past six years, Symantec said. Aimed at Windows users, Regin slowly infiltrated its targets, taking care at each stage to hide its tracks, the company said. ""Many components of Regin remain undiscovered and additional functionality and versions may exist,"" it added.  ""Its design makes it highly suited for persistent, long-term surveillance operations against targets."" Jason Steer, director of technology strategy at security firm FireEye, said: ""These types of toolkits have existed for a few years now."" He added: ""It's a challenge to the whole security industry as to how they find these malicious and sophisticated pieces of code,"" Security firms were better at spotting such things even though Regin and its ilk were built to fool modern-day tools that look for malicious programs and monitor activity to spot anything suspicious. The techniques Regin used to sneak on to a network and communicate with its creators were very complicated, he said. media caption Vikram Thakur, Symantec: ""We don't believe it is being used... for mass surveillance"" ""It's clearly been written by someone that has much more than making money in mind,"" he said. Mr Steer said the tip-offs about Regin and similarly sophisticated threats often came from government agencies who kept an eye on the cyber spying capabilities of both friendly and hostile nations.  Recovering files Victims had been infected via spoofed versions of well-known websites and by exploiting known vulnerabilities in web browser software,  said Symantec in a detailed analysis.  In a blogpost , security company F-Secure said it had first encountered Regin in 2009 after investigating what was making a server on the network of one of its customers crash repeatedly. Closer investigation revealed the culprit to be Regin which was attempting to insert itself into the heart of the software controlling the server. Chief research officer Mikko Hypponen said: ""Finding malware of this calibre is very rare.  ""We're still missing big parts of the puzzle."" ""Nevertheless, it's obvious this is a very complicated malware written by a well-equipped nation-state."" He added that the malware did not look like it originated in China or Russia - the places suspected of creating many other stealthy, spying programs. Security firm Kaspersky Lab said it too had spotted Regin being used to infiltrate networks and steal data. In one attack, Regin was used to gather administrative details for a mobile phone network in the Middle East that, if used, would have given attackers control over the system.  Symantec said it had captured the first copies of Regin in a small number of organisations between 2008 and 2011. Soon after, the malware had appeared to have been withdrawn, but a new version found in 2013 was now being actively used.  Only about 100 Regin infections have so far been identified. It is believed to provide the ability to: remote access victims' computers remotely take screenshots control a mouse pointer steal data  recover deleted files Symantec said that Regin had a lot in common with other malicious programs such as Flame, Duqu and Stuxnet, also thought to be written by nation states to aid their spying efforts.

But a UK security firm has shown the BBC how one tool, sold around the world to spooks, actually works. It allows spies to take secret pictures with a phone's camera and record conversations with the microphone, without the phone owner knowing. Hacking Team's software was recently stolen from the company by hackers and published on the web. Almost any data on a phone, tablet or PC can be accessed by the tool and it is fascinating how much it can do. When Joe Greenwood, of cybersecurity firm 4Armed, saw that source code for the program had been dumped online by hackers, he couldn't resist experimenting with it. Although he had to fiddle with the code to make it work, it only took a day before he had it up and running. The software consists of the surveillance console, which displays data retrieved from a hacked device, and malware planted on the target device itself. 4Armed was careful to note that using it to spy on someone without their consent would be against the law. Listening in After testing the software on his own PC, Mr Greenwood soon realised the scope of its capabilities.  ""You can download files, record microphones, webcam images, websites visited, see what programs are running, intercept Skype calls,"" he told the BBC. The software even has some in-built features to track Bitcoin payments, which can be difficult to associate with individuals without additional data about when and how transactions were performed. In a live demonstration of the system, Mr Greenwood showed how an infected phone could be made to record audio from the microphone, even when the device was locked, and use the phone's camera without its owner knowing. ""We can actually take photos without them realising.  ""So the camera in the background is running, taking photos every number of seconds,"" explained Mr Greenwood. It was also possible to listen in on phone calls, access the list of contacts stored on the device and track what websites the phone user was visiting. image caption The tool can record audio from a phone's microphone, even when the device is locked Both Mr Greenwood and 4Armed's technical director, Marc Wickenden, said they were surprised by the sleekness of the interface.  Both point out, though, that customers could be paying upwards of Â£1m for the software and would expect it to be user-friendly, especially if it was intended for use by law enforcers on the beat. For the tracked user, though, there are very few ways of finding out that they are being watched. One red flag, according to Mr Greenwood, is a sudden spike in network data usage, indicating that information is being sent somewhere in the background. Experienced spies, however, would be careful to minimise this in order to remain incognito. At present, spy software like this is only likely to be secretly deployed on the phones and computers of people who are key targets for an intelligence agency. Spy catcher The version of the spyware distributed online is now likely to be more easily detected by anti-virus programs because companies analysing the source code are in the process of updating their systems to recognise it. Security expert Graham Cluley said it should be as easy to detect as malware. ""The danger will be that malicious hackers could take that code and augment it or change it so it no longer looks like Hacking Team's versions, which might avoid detection,"" he added. The best course of action, said Mr Cluley, is to keep operating systems and software as up to date as possible. In a statement, a spokesman for Hacking Team said it advised its customers not to use the software once the breach was discovered. ""As soon as the event was discovered, Hacking Team immediately advised all clients to discontinue the use of that version of the software, and the company provided a patch to assure that client surveillance data and other information stored on client systems was secure.  ""From the beginning Hacking Team has assumed that the code that has been released is compromised,"" he said. The spokesman added that the software would be operated by clients of Hacking Team, not Hacking Team itself, and therefore no sensitive data relating to ongoing investigations had been compromised in the breach. ""Of course, there are many who would use for their own purposes the information released by the criminals who attacked Hacking Team. ""This was apparently not a concern of the attackers who recklessly published the material for all online.   ""Compiling the software would take considerable technical skill, so not just anyone could do that, but that is not to say it is impossible,"" he said.

Symantec says the bug, named Regin, was probably created by a government and has been used for six years against a range of targets around the world. Once installed on a computer, it can do things like capture screenshots, steal passwords or recover deleted files.   Experts say computers in Russia, Saudi Arabia and Ireland have been hit most. It has been used to spy on government organisations, businesses and private individuals, they say.  Researchers say the sophistication of the software indicates that it is a cyber-espionage tool developed by a nation state.  They also said it likely took months, if not years, to develop and its creators have gone to great lengths to cover its tracks. Sian John, a security strategist at Symantec, said: ""It looks like it comes from a Western organisation. It's the level of skill and expertise, the length of time over which it was developed."" Symantec has drawn parallels with Stuxnet, a computer worm thought to have been developed by the US and Israel to target Iran's nuclear program.

spyware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24931374|"Post Prism: The new meaning of spyware By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter Published 22 November 2013 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption It may not just be the cybercriminals accessing your computer If you thought you were pretty clever knowing that spyware refers to pieces of malicious code put on computers in order for cybercriminals to steal your passwords and other IDs, think again. These days it has a much more literal sense, at least if the latest documents leaked by former US National Security Agency (NSA) contractor Edward Snowden to the  Der Spiegel  newspaper are to be believed. The documents allege that spies are regularly using tools more usually associated with cybercriminals. It is alleged UK spy agency GCHQ operatives created fake web pages that injected malware into the computers of engineers running one of Belgium's largest telecommunications companies in order to be able to access its systems. ""We have to realise that a number of GCHQ staff are indeed hackers,  but licensed by the state and protected by the Intelligence Services Act 1994 and ministerial warrant,"" said digital forensic expert Prof Peter Sommer. ""They will deploy every type of hacker trick to achieve their aims."" It is a view endorsed by Dwayne Melancon, chief technology officer of security firm Tripwire and a man used to looking at malicious code as part of his daily job.  ""It seems you can't throw a rock these days without hitting a nation state surveillance operation,"" he said. It raised some pretty fundamental questions about whom we trust online, said Prof Alan Woodward, security expert and lecturer at Surrey University, who has undertaken consultancy work for GCHQ. ""When the criminals start to look like law enforcement, that is a very dangerous practice,"" he said. ""Where do you draw the line? Is it with engineers who control machines or should they be allowed to have malware on everyone's PC 'just in case' they want to use it as a route to some high value target?"" Bespoke malware   image caption The police are also using the tools of the cybercriminals There is now a growing body of evidence to suggest that the use of malware is standard practice for the police as well as the intelligence services. In the summer it was revealed that the FBI used mobile malware to infect and control a suspect's handset. And in September the FBI admitted that it had planted hidden code on the dark net, a part of the internet favoured by cybercriminals because it is unreachable by standard search engines. Security researchers who dissected the code found it exploited a security hole in Firefox, which reported back to a mysterious server in northern Virginia.  Meanwhile leaked German police documents suggest that the Federal Criminal Police Office is working on its own surveillance software, which it hopes to have ready by the end of 2014.  Accidental infection Prof Sommer said: ""I'd hope that the intelligence service uses highly targeted malware.  ""So if they target someone specifically, they send an email with a booby trap - but they will only be sending it to the target and the malware wouldn't have any self-replicating properties."" But Mr Melancon is not so sure, particularly if the authorities are using so-called ""watering hole"" websites, which are popular with specific groups of users. In the Belgian case, GCHQ is alleged to have targeted LinkedIn and tech news site Slashdot in order to lure the engineers it was targeting. ""Such sites are notoriously indiscriminate,"" said Mr Melancon. "" You can limit the risk of accidental infection of uninvolved persons, but you can't eliminate that risk entirely.  ""Collateral damage and inadvertent surveillance of non-targeted individuals is almost certain.""  Legal framework The other big question raised by the allegations published by Der Spiegel is just whom the spooks are after. If you hear the word ""target"" from an intelligence agency, you probably assume they are referring to a terrorist or some other individual intent on harm.  What the Belgian case reveals is that engineers can also be targets. So is it ethical to put malware on the computer of an innocent employee who just happens to have access to a computer system you may want to look at? ""If the result is damaging or destroying data or property, then it could certainly be deemed unethical by a reasonable person.   ""Likewise, violating the civil liberties of an individual crosses the ethical line. You can rationalise damage to engineers by lumping them into a collective as part of 'their organisation', but this is very subjective,"" said Mr Melancon. For its part, GCHQ offered a pretty standard response to the particular allegations about breaking into Belgian servers. ""All GCHQ's work is carried out in accordance with a strict legal and policy framework, which ensure that our activities are authorised, necessary and proportionate, and that there is rigorous oversight, including from the secretary of state, the Interception and intelligence services commissioners and the Intelligence and Security Committee,"" it said. The only way to be sure you too do not become a ""target"" is to ""consider all networks untrustworthy"", according to Robert Hansen, technical evangelist at WhiteHat Security. ""Unfortunately, there isn't much hope for the individual because most of the things that would otherwise secure the user have historically been controlled by groups that have close ties to the government,"" he said. He is talking about the companies that register websites and encryption certificates. Johnny English? Sir Tim Berners Lee, inventor of the world wide web, has described attempts by spy agencies to crack encryption as ""appalling and foolish"". But through it all the general public seems to have been remarkably sanguine. Prof Sommer said: ""In Germany and the US people are outraged but in the UK that is less the case.  ""People are rather proud of what GCHQ did during the war and they think it probably is not going to affect me."" What the Snowden leaks have dispelled once and for all is any lurking suspicion that the security forces are some bumbling Johnny English sort of outfit. ""The fact is that intelligence agencies are using advanced techniques actually more advanced than those used by criminals,"" said Amichai Shulman, chief technology officer of security firm Imperva. ""We have enough proof now that governments do have the necessary technology and personnel that can effectively fight cybercrime. They just chose to put it to a different use."""

The German state of Bavaria has admitted using the spyware, but claimed it had acted within the law. Three other states have also confirmed they have used spyware in order to investigate serious criminal offences, a German newspaper reports. Use of the software was exposed by a German hacker group. The Berlin-based  Chaos Computer Club  (CCC) said it had analysed a ""lawful interception"" malware programme called Federal Trojan, used by the German police force. They found that, once installed, the programme allows its operators to monitor exactly what the user is looking at - from which websites they have visited, to the emails they send and receive and the calls made through Skype. ""The malware cannot only siphon away intimate data but also offers a remote control or backdoor functionality for uploading and executing arbitrary other programs,"" the group wrote on its website. The program, it said, had ""significant design and implementation flaws"", which made ""all of the functionality available to anyone on the internet"". Strong feelings The CCC had analysed a laptop allegedly belonging to a man accused of illegally exporting pharmaceuticals. His lawyer claims the Trojan program was installed on his client's computer when it passed through airport customs. Bavaria Interior Minister Joachim Herrman has confirmed that state officials have been using the software since 2009 - though he made no mention of any specific incidents - and insisted that they had acted within the law. However, he promised a review of the software's use. The German broadcaster  Deutsche Welle  reported on Tuesday that three other states - Baden-Wurttemberg, Brandenburg and Lower Saxony had confirmed using spyware, although it is not clear if all four states had used the same software. Justice Minister Sabine Leutheusser-Schnarrenberger has called on the federal and state governments to launch an investigation into the matter. ""Trying to play down or trivialise the matter won't do,"" she said. ""The citizen, in both the public and private spheres, must be protected from snooping through strict state control mechanisms."" The BBC's Stephen Evans says the incident has sparked a row because Germans, given the country's Nazi and Communist past, feel strongly about spying on citizens.

Published 4 November 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption WhatsApp is one of the biggest instant messaging apps in the world With WhatsApp confirming that its software was used to install spyware on phones, many are considering deleting the popular messaging app. However, experts say this is not the answer. There has been considerable outrage and worry in many countries including India, after WhatsApp confirmed that some of its users were targeted with spyware.  Some in the country have pointed fingers at the government, accusing them of being behind the hack, given that the group accused of creating the software, NSO Group, reportedly sells only to governments.  WhatsApp has sued the company over the allegations, which it has strongly rejected. The Indian government has also denied involvement.  Some users have been looking at options other than WhatsApp, including messaging apps like Signal or Telegram, believing that they are more secure. But experts say that WhatsApp, an app used by approximately 1.5 billion people in 180 countries and 400 million in India, is bearing the brunt of a hack that is not completely its fault.  While a vulnerability in the app's video-calling feature allowed the spyware to go through without user intervention, it ultimately took over the phone because of gaps in the phone's operating systems. ""The vulnerabilities the spyware exploited were at the level of the operating system, be it Android or Apple,"" Vinay Kesari, a technology lawyer specialising in privacy, said.  ""If there's spyware in your handset, everything that is readable or even whatever that comes through your camera or mic is at risk,"" technology writer Prasanto K Roy said.  image copyright Getty Images image caption WhatsApp is a popular messaging app in India WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are encrypted end-to-end. This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device. ""In this case, it doesn't matter if the app is end-to-end encrypted or not - once spyware is on your handset, hackers are able to see whatever is on your phone as you see it - this is already decrypted and in a readable form at this stage,"" Mr Kesari said.  ""You may as well have unlocked your phone and handed it over,"" he added. ""But importantly, this breach shows just how vulnerable operating systems are."" Much of the chatter has focused on switching to other messaging apps, particularly Signal, which is known for its open source code - but does that mean your phone would be better protected against spyware? Not necessarily, they say. ""With Signal, there is an added layer of transparency because they release their code to the public - so if you are a sophisticated coder, and the company says they have fixed a bug, you can access the code and see for yourself,"" Mr Kesari said.  ""But that doesn't mean the app has an added layer of protection against such attacks."" Mr Roy told the BBC that the attack went beyond the app.  image copyright Getty Images image caption India is one of the fastest-growing internet markets in the world ""For those whose handsets were compromised, all their information was at risk - not just WhatsApp,"" Mr Roy said.  As of now, there is no reason to believe that WhatsApp is ""any less safe"" than other apps, he added.

spyware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50249859|"'I was a victim of the WhatsApp hack' By Joe Tidy Cyber-security reporter, BBC News Published 31 October 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing In April, Faustin Rukundo received a mysterious call over WhatsApp from a number he did not recognise.  He answered, but the line was silent and then it went dead. He tried calling back but nobody answered. He didn't know it but his phone had been compromised. As a Rwandan exile living in Leeds, Mr Rukundo was already privacy conscious. He searched for the number online and found the dialling code was from Sweden.  Strange, he thought. But he soon forgot about it.  Then the number called once more. Again nobody picked up.  There were also missed calls from other numbers he did not recognise and he began to get worried about his family's safety, so he bought a new phone.  Within a day, the unknown number called again.  ""I tried to answer and they hung up before I heard any voice,"" Mr Rukundo told the BBC.  ""Whenever I called back, no-one answered. I realised something was wrong when I started seeing files missing from the phone. ""I spoke to my colleagues at the Rwanda National Congress and they too had similar experiences. They were getting missed calls from the same numbers as me."" The Rwanda National Congress is a group that opposes the Rwandan regime. It was not until May, when Mr Rukundo read reports that WhatsApp had been hacked, that he realised what had happened.  ""I first read the story about the WhatsApp hack on the BBC and thought, 'Wow, this could explain what's happened to me,'"" he said. ""I changed my phone and realised my mistake. They were following my number around and putting the spy software on each new device by calling the same number.""   image copyright Reuters image caption Victims did not need to answer the call For months, Mr Rukundo was convinced that he and his colleagues were some of the estimated 1,400 people targeted by attackers exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp. But it was only confirmed to him this week following a call from Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto. For six months, the organisation has been working with Facebook to investigate the hack and find out who was affected.  Researchers there say: ""As part of our investigation into the incident, Citizen Lab has identified over 100 cases of abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe."" Mr Rukundo's profile as an outspoken critic of the Rwandan regime is consistent with the sort of people who were targets for this spyware. It was allegedly built and sold by the Israel-based NSO Group and sold to governments around the world. Hackers used the software to spy on journalists, human rights activists, political dissidents and diplomats. Mr Rukundo says he has not had any calls since the original hack, but the experience has made him and his family feel paranoid and scared. ""Honestly, even before they confirmed this, we were gutted and terrified. It looks like they only bugged my phone for around two weeks but they had access to everything,"" he told the BBC. ""Not only my activity during that time but my whole email history and all my contacts and connections. Everything is watched, the computers, our phones, nothing is safe. Even when we talk, they could be listening. I still don't feel safe."" Mr Rukundo fled Rwanda in 2005 when critics of the government were being arrested and jailed. He says he fought to have his wife released after she was kidnapped and detained for two months on a family visit in 2007. Facebook, the owner of WhatsApp, is attempting to sue the NSO Group. The NSO Group denies any wrongdoing. In court documents, Facebook accuses the company of exploiting a then-unknown vulnerability in WhatsApp. The app is used by approximately 1.5 billion people in 180 countries.  The service is popular for its end-to-end encryption, which means messages are scrambled as they travel across the internet, making them unreadable if intercepted. The filing at the US District Court of Northern California describes how the spyware was allegedly installed.  The powerful software known as Pegasus is an NSO Group product that can remotely and covertly extract valuable intelligence from mobile devices, by sharing all phone activity including communications and location data with the attacker.  WhatsApp discovers 'targeted' surveillance attack WhatsApp sues Israeli firm over phone hacking claims In previous spyware attacks, victims have been tricked into downloading the software by clicking on booby-trapped web links. But with the WhatsApp hack, Facebook alleges that it was installed on victims' phones without them taking any action at all.  The company says that between January 2018 and May 2019, NSO Group created WhatsApp accounts using telephone numbers registered in different counties, including Cyprus, Israel, Brazil, Indonesia, Sweden and the Netherlands. Then in April and May, the victims were attacked with a phone call over WhatsApp, it is claimed. The filing says: ""To avoid the technical restrictions built into WhatsApp Signaling Servers, defendants formatted call initiation messages containing malicious code to appear like a legitimate call and concealed the code within call settings. ""Disguising the malicious code as call settings enabled defendants to deliver it to the target device and made the malicious code appear as if it originated from WhatsApp Signaling Servers."" image copyright AFP The victims would be completely unaware that they had been bugged. In some cases the only thing they noticed were mysterious missed calls in WhatsApp logs.  The document states that Facebook: believes the hack was an abuse of its computer network wants an injunction stopping the NSO Group having any access to its platforms. accepts that NSO Group was allegedly carrying out the hacks on behalf of its customers, but Facebook is going after the company as the architects who created the software NSO Group has been accused of supplying the spyware that let the killers of journalist Jamal Khashoggi track him down.  NSO Group denies involvement in that incident and says it will fight these latest allegations. ""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute today's allegations and will vigorously fight them,"" the company said in a statement to the BBC.  ""The sole purpose of NSO Group is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime.""

WhatsApp said that it had no reason to believe users' phones were affected. News of the new issue came  soon after WhatsApp admitted that its software was used  to install spyware on phones. Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, had announced the fix for the new vulnerability in the system a few days ago. Pegasus breach: Will quitting WhatsApp make your phone safer? WhatsApp: Indians among those 'targeted' by spyware Cert said that if users opened the video file, the software installed itself on the phone - in similar fashion to  the Pegasus malware , which is believed to have been used against journalists and activists.  The agency added that the vulnerability would have allowed attackers to access phones and make changes to the device, no matter where it was geographically located.  The issue would have required requires users to open the video file, unlike the more sophisticated Pegasus which activated itself through a vulnerability in WhatsApp's video calling function and did not require the call to be answered. The messaging app has also said it has issued a security update that should take care of the issue.  India has 400 million WhatsApp users, making the country its biggest market.

Residents of Bnei Brak, just outside Tel Aviv, will only be allowed out in exceptional circumstances. Only some key workers will be allowed in. A senior health official said almost 40% of the town probably had the virus, though his claim was refuted. Overall, more than 7,000 Israelis have been infected and 37 have died. media caption Israel's coronavirus patient number 74 posts about her experience on social media Across the country, people have been told to stay within a 100-metre (330 ft) radius of their homes; public gatherings have been banned; and anyone going outdoors has been told to cover their face with a mask or scarf. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is in voluntary self-isolation despite testing negative for the disease, has warned that further restrictions might be imposed to try to curb the spread of the virus. Growing disquiet Bnei Brak was declared a ""restricted zone"" at a cabinet meeting on Thursday night. Earlier, police set up cordons around the town to reduce the flow of traffic moving in and out. The latest measures mean residents will only be allowed out of the town on a case-by-case basis. Non-residents - other than security forces, essential services workers and journalists - will not be allowed in. Coronavirus: A ticking time-bomb for the Middle East Israeli spyware firm pitches to be Covid-19 saviour About 4,500 elderly residents - those deemed most at risk - will be evacuated from the town and quarantined in specially designated hotels, according to the Jerusalem Post newspaper. Soldiers from the Israeli military's Paratroopers Brigade were being deployed to help the Homefront Command, the paper said. Bnei Brak is only second to the much larger city of Jerusalem in terms of the total number of coronavirus cases. On Thursday, the head of the Maccabi health service used by about half the 200,000-strong population of Bnei Brak told a parliamentary committee that about 38% of residents were likely to have the virus, and that there were probably tens of thousands of cases which had not been officially confirmed. However, Israeli media later reported that according to the Ministry of Health and Maccabi officials the figure was the result of a miscalculation. There has been growing disquiet in Israel about the slowness of some ultra-Orthodox communities to adopt official measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Many ultra-Orthodox live within large families in crowded neighbourhoods. Their access to the internet and social media is also limited for religious reasons, meaning news and information from the outside world is comparatively poor. In some strictly religious communities, gatherings for prayer and celebrations including weddings have continued to take place, despite the nationwide ban.  However, two days ago Prime Minister Netanyahu noted that there had been a ""very positive shift"" in the attitude of the ultra-Orthodox towards the seriousness of the virus. Correction 9 April 2020: This article has been amended to include an assertion that the claim by the Maccabi health service official about the likely infection rate in Bnei Brak was based on an erroneous calculation.

Rory Cellan-Jones Technology correspondent @BBCRoryCJ on Twitter Published 17 May 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Reuters It was the week when we learned that a missed WhatsApp call could plant spyware on your phone and when San Francisco moved to ban facial recognition technology.  On Tech Tent we explore our attitudes to technology which can catch criminals - but also be used to track our every move. Listen to  the latest  Tech Tent  podcast on BBC Sounds When WhatsApp's owner Facebook spotted a flaw in the app, which allowed an intruder to plant spyware on a phone with one missed call, it was unusually open about who might be behind it. The firm briefed journalists that the attack had ""all the hallmarks"" of a private company that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over mobile phones. It was widely assumed that the company in question was Israel's NSO Group, which has previously been accused of selling spyware called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists.  The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab, which monitors digital attacks against civil society, has been tracking the NSO Group for some years.  Its senior researcher John Scott-Railton tells Tech Tent that Facebook's decision to be so upfront about who was responsible, suggests that it was ""pretty fed up with the behaviour of the private spyware company"". He says Citizen Lab had previously seen NSO's Pegasus spyware used to track dozens of journalists, lawyers and every kind of activist in Mexico, via the old-fashioned method of persuading them to click on a link. Public safety But last Sunday they had spotted the new method exploiting the flaw in WhatsApp being used to target - unsuccessfully - a London-based human rights lawyer who works with some of the Mexico activists. image copyright Getty Images image caption Some people were caught out by being tricked into clicking on a booby-trapped link He says the spyware is quite insidious: ""Once it gets on to a phone, that phone is basically like a spy in the victim's pockets, the microphone can be turned on, encrypted chats can be taken off the phone, private photographs, and so on."" NSO Group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour.  The Israeli firm said in a statement: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror.  ""The company does not operate the system and, after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions.""  Since earlier this year, the company has been majority owned by Novalpina, a London-based private equity group whose chairman Stephen Peel is now on the board of NSO. We asked him for an interview. He was not available but his PR team pointed us to an open letter written in April - before the WhatsApp hack emerged - to a number of NGOs including Citizen Lab. At some length it defends the previous conduct of the Israeli firm and promises that under Novalpina's ownership there will be a constant focus on respecting human rights: ""We expect each company within our portfolio to act with integrity and in a manner that is socially responsible."" Face finding Another company under the spotlight over surveillance technology is Amazon. At its annual general meeting next week, its shareholders will debate a motion calling on the company to stop selling its facial recognition system to the US government. image copyright Getty Images image caption Police facial recognition systems have been shown to do poorly when analysing non-white faces The vote comes just after San Francisco became the first city to ban its public bodies from using facial recognition, amid mounting disquiet about intrusive surveillance in public places. Mary Beth Gallagher, representing Catholic institutions investing in Amazon, says there are concerns both about the quality of the technology and the way it could be used: ""Even if it's 100% accurate we don't want it to be used by law enforcement because of the impact it could have on society."" Just like NSO, Amazon insists its technology is used in really positive ways, such as helping to find victims of child trafficking.  But, asked whether it should be monitoring potential misuse of facial recognition by its clients, Amazon Web Services tech evangelist Ian Massingham insists it is not their job: ""The  right organisations to handle those issues are policy-makers and government."" Surveillance technology - whether that is facial recognition or spyware - is a very lucrative industry, shrouded in secrecy. But the companies behind it can themselves expect far closer monitoring from now on.

It was ""a serious issue of national security"", and ""requires measures, including data localisation"", officials were quoted as saying. Experts called it a ""bizarre response"".  ""This makes no sense at all. The location of the data had nothing to do with the Pegasus breach,"" technology expert Prasanto K Roy told the BBC.  ""WhatsApp was very transparent about the breach and reported it to the authorities. What is important now, is to find out who did it and how."" WhatsApp: Indians among those 'targeted' by spyware Pegasus breach: India denies WhatsApp hack amid outrage Why India wants to track WhatsApp messages ""Data localisation completely goes against the whole concept of the internet which is a global network,"" he added. Reports have quoted government officials as saying that they wanted user data stored locally as  the Pegasus breach ""compromised national security "". What was the Pegasus breach all about? Hackers were able to install surveillance software on phones and other devices by using a major vulnerability in the messaging app. Targets received video or voice call requests from an unknown number - which even if ignored, allowed the spyware, known as Pegasus, to be installed on the device.  This allowed users to remotely access everything on the phone, including text messages and location. WhatsApp fixed the vulnerability as soon as it was discovered and informed affected users. It also filed a lawsuit against Israeli firm NSO Group, alleging it was behind the cyber-attacks that infected devices in April and May. NSO Group, which makes software for surveillance, says it only works with government agencies and strongly denied responsibility for the attacks. image copyright Getty Images image caption Indian activists and politicians have pointed fingers at the state Activists and politicians pointed fingers at the state after WhatsApp revealed Indian journalists and activists were among those targeted. The government has denied the claims. However, it has also repeatedly refused to discuss the issue in parliament.  It refused to answer questions about who had authorised the attacks and instead cited a controversial law that specified the right of agencies to monitor and decrypt information in national security interest. It also tried to stop a parliamentary committee on cyber security from discussing the matter, saying it did not fall under the purview of the panel.

Amy says it all started when her husband seemed to know intimate details about her friends. ""He would drop snippets into conversations, such as knowing about Sarah's baby. Really private things that he shouldn't have known about. If I asked how he knew these things, he'd say I'd told him and accuse me of losing it,"" she says. Amy - not her real name - also began to wonder how he seemed to know where she was all the time. ""Sometimes he would say he saw me at a cafe where I was meeting my friends and say he was just passing by chance. I started to question everything and trust no-one, even my friends,"" she says. For months, these incidents built up, turning an abusive marriage into a nightmare that came to a chilling conclusion after a Halloween family trip. ""We'd been to visit a pumpkin patch and were having a rare good weekend, which basically means my husband hadn't taken anything out on me. Our six-year-old son was playing on the floor and was so happy,"" Amy says. ""My husband passed me his phone to show me a picture he'd taken at the farm and in that split-second I saw an alert pop up on his screen. It read, 'Daily report on Amy's Mac is ready to view.' ""I felt this chill go through me and I stopped breathing for a minute. I had to excuse myself and pretended I needed the bathroom. I had to be there for my son and pretend that I hadn't seen anything. ""The first moment I could, I went to the library to use the computer and look up the spyware he'd used. That's when everything made sense after months of thinking I was going crazy."" Stalkerware - also known as spouseware - are powerful surveillance software programs typically sold openly online. On a device, all messages can be read, screen activity recorded, GPS locations tracked and cameras used to spy on what an individual is doing.

Kaspersky researchers say their protection technologies have detected stalkerware on 37,532 devices so far this year.  And principal security researcher David Emm says this is the ""tip of a very large iceberg"". ""Most people will routinely protect a laptop or desktop, not that many people actually protect a mobile device,"" he says. ""This information is coming back from installations of our product on [smartphones]... so this figure doesn't even go close to what the total would be."" Webwise: An introduction to spyware The apps that let parents 'spy' on their kids Spyware use in domestic violence 'escalating' Kaspersky's findings indicate Russia is the country with the highest levels of stalkerware activity. India, Brazil, the United States and Germany complete the top five, with the UK in eighth place with 730 detections. Another security company says there are practical steps people can take if they suspect they are already being spied on. ""It's always advisable to check which apps are on your phone and conduct a virus scan where necessary and if there are any apps on your device that you do not recognise it is worth searching online for reviews and deleting them,"" says Jake Moore, from Eset. ""As a general rule, if you aren't using an app, delete it."" Once Amy realised her computer had been compromised, she developed a severe mistrust of technology, which she is only just overcoming. Charities say this is a common psychological response to such a trauma.  Jessica was another victim of stalkerware. Her ex-husband routinely spied on her through her phone's microphone and would play mind games by repeating specific phrases she and her friends had used in private conversations. It's been years since she escaped the relationship but she still leaves her phone locked in the car when seeing friends. image copyright Getty Images image caption Stalkerware is often used to monitor victim's locations and messages Gemma Toynton, from domestic abuse charity Safer Places, says she see this long-term effect a lot in her cases.  ""It reduces someone's trust,"" she says. ""It makes them see a phone or laptop as a weapon, because that's what it's been used for. ""Technology has become, in their minds like a net around them and a lot of people do withdraw from using the internet. ""It really does impact your whole life. The fact that this stalkerware is on the rise is a real concern."" Amy, who is from the US, is now divorced and lives many miles away from her ex-husband.  She has a restraining order preventing him from direct contact with her and he is legally allowed to communicate logistics about their son's care via written letter only.

I bought it online and installed it on to my work phone. It took me about an hour and I used the 24-hour live support offered by the company when I encountered any problems. Spyware companies advertise their services as ""employee monitoring"" or ""parental control"" products.  In many countries, including the UK, using the spyware on a spouse without their permission is illegal, so many of the companies' websites are littered with disclaimers advising against this. However, some of the same websites link to articles, seemingly written by associates, recommending the software as a spy tool for ""cheatings wives and husbands"".  In a live chat with the company whose product I was testing, I directly told them: ""I want to install this on my wife's phone, will it be secret?""  The customer service-representative responded: ""The application will start to work in stealth mode right after installation. I'll be happy to help."" I also downloaded five of the top cyber-security products on to the infected mobile and carried out a free scan.  All of them gave alerts for ""potentially harmful software"".  The Crown Prosecution Service says there aren't specific laws related to the use of stalkerware but any criminal activity like this can be prosecuted by a number of means including the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Amy says more should be done to legislate against the use of these technologies.  ""They need to stop hiding behind plausible deniability,"" she says.  ""There is a wink that's given when they send this little disclaimer that says, 'We don't approve of you spying on wives.' They know what their customers are doing though.

Smartphones using Android 2.3.7 and older, and iPhone iOS 8 or older, are those affected by the update.  The operating systems that WhatsApp is dropping support for are legacy operating systems, which are no longer updated or installed on new devices. Most users will simply be able to update their operating systems in order to continue using the messaging service.

""This is likely to disproportionally impact the long-tail of its users, particularly in growth markets where there is a high proportion of older devices."" WhatsApp,  which was one of the most-downloaded apps of the decade , first warned users that these changes would happen back in 2017.

But within months, the live-in relationship began to unravel - there were frequent fights, mostly over what she was posting on the internet. ""I had no idea what would trigger him. Whenever I would share a photo or a selfie on social media, he would get upset about who's liking my photo, who's commenting on it,"" Ms Harikumar told the BBC.  Since she didn't want to make him angry, she trimmed her friends' list, unfriended her exes and restricted access to male friends.  ""Even when he was not present, I was thinking for him - before putting a post, I was trying to anticipate how he would react? Soon, I was putting the same restrictions on my life offline too. I was walking on eggshells.""  But that didn't help - he still found things to get angry about. ""One day, he got upset by a random tweet that someone had put out saying 'I'll do anything for a person with a nose stud'. A friend with a sizeable number of followers tagged me and commented, 'Then you should look at Indu.' ""I had not seen the tweet, but my partner sent me a message saying 'you have pimps in high places',"" she says, adding that it was not the only abuse she'd faced online. Ms Harikumar's latest crowd-sourced Instagram art project - LoveSexandTech - draws from her own personal experiences and those of other women of ""online abuse"". It's supported by Take Back the Tech, a global campaign to make digital space safer for women. image copyright Indu Harikumar Online abuse is pervasive globally and a lot of it is directed at women. They are trolled for their politics or opinions, many often complain of receiving threats of rapes and sexual assault. In 2017,  Amnesty International  polled 4,000 women from eight countries and found that 76% of women who were abused on social media restricted their use - 32% said they had stopped expressing opinions on some issues. In India too, the report said, that increasing access to the internet had resulted in more women facing online abuse for participating in public life and sharing their opinions on social media platforms.  Campaigners say online abuse has the power to ""belittle, demean, intimidate and eventually silence women"".  But the nameless, faceless trolls are one thing, a much bigger problem is how does one deal with abuse from their loved ones?  The artist painting women's breast stories Gaslighting: The 'perfect' romance that became a nightmare India 'fails' victims of abuse  That is what LoveSexandTech is documenting - how gender-based violence in intimate relationships leads to a shrinkage of the space women occupy online. Ms Harikumar says when she first put out a post in August asking women to share their stories about ""restrictions, surveillance and control placed by intimate partners"", she didn't think she would get many responses. She initially called her project Love, Sex and Violence but then ""I realised that in India, a lot of violations are not even considered violence, especially the emotional ones"". So, she spelt it out in greater details, explaining that ""this could be anything from the threat to make a chat you shared with them public or with friends, threatening to leak your nude photos or leaking them, causing you emotional, physical or sexual harm for talking to someone online or posting something that they don't approve of, or adding spyware to your devices"". Within days, Ms Harikumar says, lots of women responded with their stories of having faced ""gaslighting, control, slut-shaming, emotional violence and manipulation"".  image copyright Indu Harikumar ""I didn't think I'd get such a lot of stories,"" she says, adding that many women said they had suppressed their trauma for long and found that sharing their stories was ""cathartic"". At the same time, they wanted their stories to serve as a warning to others who found themselves in a similar situation. One woman, who wrote in saying she was ""very conscious of her body"", spoke about her shock on finding out that her lover had shared her nude photo online without her consent. ""Three weeks after he'd shared it, he showed it to me saying 'hope you take it in the right spirit'. He was pleased that so many men said they desired me sexually.  ""He said, 'These men can only desire you, but I alone can have you.' I called him a pervert. He said he did it because he wanted me to feel good about my body. But I felt so violated."" Another wrote in saying she stopped posting selfies because every time she posted one, her boyfriend would berate her, telling her it was her way of seeking validation. Yet another said her partner badgered her until she shared her email password with him saying ""you're hiding something or you're talking to other men"". And another woman said her partner used her thumb to unlock her phone as she slept and later shamed her over a video she had watched online. image copyright Indu Harikumar Almost all the women, Ms Harikumar says, narrated experiences similar to her own - that in an attempt to make their relationship work, they'd stopped talking to their exes, deleted them from their friends' list, and stopped posting selfies. They had also removed photos showing cleavage, or where they were smoking or drinking. ""They were deleting their history in an attempt to appear good. Most women take refuge in the 'good girl narrative'. It's universal - it keeps them safe. We are told women can only be of two kinds - Mother Mary or a slut.  ""So, we think if we are good, things will pan out okay. We often blame ourselves when things go wrong."" But what is heartening, she says, is that the women who ""sent in their stories said they'd realised that they were being abused and stood up to their abusers"". One woman wrote in about how she stood up to her ex-boyfriend when he threatened to send her photos to her dad. ""I'll tell him your daughter is a slut,"" he said.  Another said her ex-boyfriend threatened to share her nudes online when she broke up with him. He backed down when she threatened to call the police on him. ""The worst thing is if you don't stand up to your abuser, then more than feeling hatred for them, you feel anger towards yourself. You blame yourself for not standing up for yourself,"" Ms Harikumar says. Through LoveSexandTech, she says, she is trying to document stories of women acknowledging the abuse, standing up to their abusers, and taking back control of technology to reclaim the virtual space that is rightfully theirs.

WhatsApp has filed a lawsuit against Israeli firm NSO Group, alleging it was behind the cyber-attacks that infected devices in April and May. NSO Group, which makes software for surveillance, says it only works with government agencies. The government has denied the claims.  ""These attempts to malign the government of India for the reported breach are completely misleading,"" a government statement read, adding that it would take ""strict action"" against those responsible for the attack. India has also asked WhatsApp for a detailed explanation, Information and Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said in a statement on Twitter.  Government of India is concerned at the breach of privacy of citizens of India on the messaging platform Whatsapp. We have asked Whatsapp to explain the kind of breach and what it is doing to safeguard the privacy of millions of Indian citizens. 1/4  pic.twitter.com/YI9Fg1fWro — Ravi Shankar Prasad (@rsprasad)  October 31, 2019   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter NSO Group has also denied the allegations against them. ""In the strongest possible terms, we dispute the allegations and vigorously fight them,"" NSO Group said in a statement to the BBC. ""The sole purpose of NSO is to provide technology to licensed government intelligence and law enforcement agencies to help them fight terrorism and serious crime,"" it added.  How did the hack take place? Hackers were able to remotely install surveillance software on phones and other devices by using a major vulnerability in the messaging app. Targets received video or voice call requests from an unknown number - which even if ignored, allowed the spyware, known as Pegasus, to be installed on the device. This allowed users to remotely access everything on the phone, including text messages and location. WhatsApp has not disclosed the number of Indians targeted.  ""While I cannot reveal their identities and the exact number, I can say that it is not an insignificant number,"" WhatsApp spokesperson Carl Woog told The Indian Express newspaper. Who has been targeted? Indian news site Scroll says it has confirmed that at least 17 individuals, including  activists, scholars and journalists, were affected by the breach .  ""The profile of the private Indian citizens targeted in this case suggests the involvement of state agencies in India,"" technology writer Prasanto K Roy told the BBC. ""These people are all activists, journalists and lawyers who work with or represent tribal people and dalits (formerly untouchables) in sensitive areas where people have clashed with the state."" image copyright Getty Images Mr Roy added that the list of people targeted so far is very specific. ""I can't think of a single foreign government, not even Pakistan, who would be interested in these particular private citizens."" Lawyer Nihalsing Rathod, who has defended human rights activists arrested after caste-based violence broke out in the western state of Maharashtra in August 2018, told BBC Marathi that his phone had been targeted.  The arrests of the activists had been sharply criticised by many as a ""witch hunt"" against those who challenged the governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Another of those targeted  is Bela Bhatia, a writer and human rights lawyer who has alleged constant harassment by police in the volatile central state of Chhattisgarh.  What is India's relationship with WhatsApp? With 400 million users, India is the biggest market for the Facebook-owned company. However, it is not the first time that the messaging platform has found itself in trouble with local authorities.  A spate of lynchings driven by rumours of child kidnappings circulating on WhatsApp prompted Indian authorities to demand that the company do something to curb the spread of misinformation on its platform.  WhatsApp: Indians among those 'targeted' by spyware Why India wants to track WhatsApp messages WhatsApp discovers 'targeted' surveillance attack WhatsApp then took several steps, including advertising in newspapers and limiting the number of forwards a single user could send to five. It also marked messages that had been forwarded with a label.  Since then, the government has gone a step further by saying that it would introduce new rules in January 2020 that would allow it to monitor, intercept and trace social media messages. In response, WhatsApp has said this would not be possible, ""given the end-to-end encryption"" the app uses.  What has WhatsApp done since the breach? Soon after it discovered the cyber-attacks in May, the company rolled out a fix, adding ""new protections"" to their systems and issuing updates. Cyber-experts at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab helped WhatsApp identify more than 100 cases of ""abusive targeting of human rights defenders and journalists in at least 20 countries across the globe, ranging from Africa, Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and North America"". Its decision to sue NSO Group is the first time an encrypted messaging provider has taken legal action of this kind WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are encrypted end-to-end. This means they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device.

After Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in 1979, followed by Jordan's in 1994, this makes the UAE only the third Arab country to normalise relations. It is the first of the six Arab Gulf states to do so. Oman. Bahrain and possibly Morocco are widely expected to follow. Discreet contacts between the UAE and Israel had been under way for years but still, the details and timing of this normalisation deal were kept secret right up to the last minute. There were no consultations between the UAE foreign ministry in Abu Dhabi and its Arab neighbours. Almost everyone was taken by surprise, most of all the Palestinians, who called it ""a stab in the back"" since they have yet to come close to getting a state of their own or ending Israeli occupation.  ""For the Palestinians, there is zero upside here,"" comments Emile Hokayem from the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies. For the UAE's de facto ruler Crown Prince Sheikh Mohammed Bin Zayed (known as MBZ), this deal is something of a gamble but one with the odds heavily in his favour.  The risk is it could make the UAE leadership highly unpopular in the wider Arab world where some social media postings have been calling it ""a sell-out"". Were the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to renege on his promise to temporarily shelve annexation of parts of the West Bank then that would be extremely embarrassing for the Emiratis and possibly see the whole deal unravel.  media caption Israel annexation: What is the West Bank? But such a move would also draw disapproval from the White House and besides, popular street protests are not usually tolerated in the Gulf.  ""In the short term, the pitfalls for the UAE are very limited,"" says Mr Hokayem. ""This deal is not going to affect the UAE regime's stability. It reflects the changing geopolitics of the region and it buys the UAE a lot of goodwill in the US, where its image has been tarnished by its involvement in the Yemen war."" Israel and UAE strike historic peace deal What does Trumpâs Mid-East plan say on key issues? Explainer: Israel, annexation and the West Bank So what is behind this deal and what's in it for this relatively young Gulf nation and former British protectorate that only became a sovereign nation in 1971? In short, it is two things - strategic advantage and technology.  The UAE, along with Bahrain and Saudi Arabia, has a deep mistrust, even a fear, of its giant, heavily-armed neighbour across the water: Iran.  image copyright EPA image caption Palestinians condemned the UAE's decision to normalise relations with Israel Gulf Arab leaders look at the map of the region and they note how, despite crippling sanctions, Iran's strategic presence has advanced rapidly across the Middle East ever since the bulwark of Saddam Hussein's regime was removed in Iraq.  Where once Iran was largely confined to its national borders, today it has proxy militias in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen. Israel shares this concern, especially when it comes to Iran's secretive nuclear programme.  Then there is what is known as ""Islamism"" or ""political Islam"", a transnational concept often embodied by the Muslim Brotherhood and one which certain Gulf Arab rulers view as an existential threat to their dynastic monarchies. No-one dislikes the Muslim Brotherhood more fervently than the UAE crown prince and this has led to the UAE backing anti-Muslim Brotherhood factions as far away as Libya while seeing its interests clash increasingly with those of Turkey's Islamist government.  In practice, this has led to the formation of an unofficial partnership of conservative Middle Eastern governments, a de facto club to which Israel, with its formidable intelligence capabilities, is now being admitted as an associate member. And there is technology, including biotech, healthcare, defence and cyber surveillance. Here, the UAE already has form, having purchased Israeli-manufactured spyware some years ago to keep an eye on its own citizens. The UAE has deep pockets - it has vast oil reserves and a per capita GDP of nearly $40,000 (Â£30,000). It also has ambitions globally, and beyond, having just become the first Arab country to send a mission to Mars.  media caption Jared Kushner: ""This is a dramatic breakthrough that will make the Middle East safer"" Israel is by far the most technologically advanced country in the Middle East, with cutting-edge inventions. If this alliance works out it could propel the UAE to a new level of prosperity and international prestige, while safeguarding future jobs for its citizens.  Israel's overtures to the Gulf go back some way. In 1995, shortly before Israel's Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated by a Jewish extremist, he sent his Foreign Minister Shimon Peres on an official visit to Oman and Qatar. Low-key Israeli trade offices then opened up in both countries' capitals. I remember calling up their office in Muscat for a comment - the Israeli representative inadvertently answered the phone with the Hebrew greeting ""Shalom"" before quickly changing it to the Arabic ""Salaamu aleikum"".  The trade initiative withered away after Mr Netanyahu became prime minister, Israel intervened in Lebanon and the second Palestinian intifada erupted. But more recently quiet diplomacy between Israel and the Gulf states has accelerated as a fear of Iranian expansionism has become the prime preoccupation. Bahrain, Oman and Qatar may well follow the UAE if this month's announcement passes without major incident. image copyright Anadolu Agency image caption Oman does not have official relations with Israel, but senior officials are in contact with each other Saudi Arabia may take longer. But back in 2002 it was the Saudis who launched the Crown Prince Abdullah Peace Plan at the Beirut Arab summit, offering Israel full recognition in exchange for a return to its pre-1967 borders. The deal briefly put Israeli PM Ariel Sharon on the spot but days later Hamas carried out bombings and all talks were off. Today the Middle East is a very different place and what was then unthinkable is now a reality.  ""Guess what were the most searched-for words online in the UAE immediately after the deal was announced?"" said an Emirati official. ""It was 'hotels in Israel'. A lot of people can't wait to visit!""

The government in Delhi said the apps were ""prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order"". TikTok denied sharing any data with the Chinese government. Beijing said it was ""strongly concerned"" about the ban.  Experts describe the ban as a political move amid rising bilateral tensions. TikTok star faces uncertain future after app ban Anti-China sentiment has been high in India since the clashes earlier this month  at the disputed border between the two nuclear-armed neighbours left 20 Indian troops dead .  China gave no details on whether there were any Chinese casualties. The fighting occurred in the Himalayan region of Ladakh, where both countries have increased deployment close to the disputed border.  Calls to boycott Chinese goods soon emerged, and the government issued directives to cancel or limit Chinese contracts with public sector companies.  But the ban on the apps took many by surprise. The list includes the microblogging platform Weibo, the strategy game Clash of Kings, Alibaba's UC Browser, and e-commerce apps Club Factory and Shein. The app makers have said they are in talks with the Indian government, while Beijing has asked India to reconsider its decision. ""We want to stress that Chinese government always asks Chinese businesses to abide by international and local laws-regulations. Indian government has a responsibility to uphold the legal rights of international investors including Chinese ones,"" ANI news agency quotes Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian as saying. What prompted the ban? India's Ministry of Information Technology has said the ban was the result of ""many complaints from various sources"" about apps that were ""stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner"". Many of the Chinese apps have been linked to controversies over data privacy, and have been accused of sharing sensitive information with the Chinese government. US senators have even called for an investigation into TikTok, which fiercely rejects such claims. media caption Geet The Indian government said in its statement that, ""the compilation of these data, its mining and profiling by elements hostile to national security and defence of India, which ultimately impinges upon the sovereignty and integrity of India, is a matter of very deep and immediate concern which requires emergency measures"". This isn't the first time Chinese apps have been banned in India. In 2017, Alibaba's UC Browser came under scrutiny for allegedly leaking mobile data of Indian users. And that year, India's defence ministry asked all armed personnel and officers to uninstall 42 Chinese apps it classified as ""spyware"", according to media reports.  Some, however, believe that the timing of the ban - amid escalating tensions - is not coincidental, but rather a response to the events at the border. ""This is a purely political move,"" Nikhil Pahwa, the editor of MediaNama, a media watchdog, told the BBC. ""I don't think it will affect the apps - maybe the number of the users [will drop] but it will only have a minor impact on [their] revenue,"" Mr Pahwa said. So what is the impact of the ban? The ban is already affecting millions of users across India, who are unable to use the blacklisted apps. ""As China has shown, governments can indeed block apps - not just remove them from the app stores, which has already happened in India, so you can't install them afresh or upgrade an existing install,"" says tech policy expert Prasanto K Roy.  He adds that although there are ways to get around the ban, it will ""effectively kill"" popular apps. ""If over 95% of 100 million users exit, that kills the 'network effect' and most of the content, and hence an app like TikTok is no longer attractive."" India is TikTok's biggest foreign market, with an estimated 120 million active users. TikTok allows users to publish and share short videos.  In the years since it has launched in India, the app has become a platform for Indians of all ages and classes - from police constables to housewives - who  dance, sing and perform for their followers. The app has turned many ordinary Indians into social media stars.   media caption The engineer whose floral headpieces went viral And Mr Roy says the ban will hurt all Indians who were making money and business connections through these apps. ""The thousands of TikTok influencers who were making a living off the platform and the many Indian traders and businessmen who need to connect to people in China and do that over WeChat âthis cuts them off."" He agrees that there is cause for concern around how the apps treat user data, but he says the response should be in the form of a privacy law, which India doesn't have.  ""It's a soft strike at the Chinese, payback for the claimed border violations and recent violent conflict,"" he adds. What do the app-makers say? TikTok's parent company, ByteDance, told the BBC, it is ""committed to working with the [Indian] government to demonstrate our dedication to user security and our commitment to the country overall. Nikhil Gandhi, TikTok's India head, said on Twitter that the company had been invited to meet ""concerned government stakeholders for an opportunity to respond and submit clarifications."" Other app makers are yet to respond to the ban. Experts say that most of these firms will try to lobby policy makers but they are not likely to be allowed as long as tensions continue at the border and anti-China sentiments remain high in the country.

The security bug was delivered using malicious Flash files embedded in Microsoft Word documents, sent as an email attachment to targets.  When the document was opened, the FinSpy malware would secretly install itself. The vulnerability was discovered by Russian security firm  Kaspersky Lab . The flaw was discovered by Kaspersky Lab researchers on 10 October. They found that the attacker - thought to be a group called BlackOasis - was targeting the governments of various countries who are members of the United Nations, as well as oil and gas companies in several regions. In the UK, activists and several non-governmental organisations (NGOs) were targeted by the attackers, but not government agencies.  Kaspersky contacted Adobe on the same day it discovered the exploit, and Adobe  published the patch  on Monday 16 October.  What is FinSpy? FinSpy is a surveillance software product developed by Anglo-German firm Gamma International. It is a legal spying tool that is used by law enforcement agencies around the world for lawful surveillance during criminal and anti-terror investigations.  ""What is unusual about BlackOasis is that they are using legal surveillance tools to hit other nation states,"" Costin Raiu, the director of Kaspersky's Global Research & Analysis Team told the BBC. ""This is unusual because everybody was using these tools for lawful surveillance in their own countries."" Due to the numerous security issues relating to Adobe Flash, the software is now  gradually being phased out . However, some older websites still use it, so web browsers now come with protections to prevent attackers from exploiting Flash to sneakily install malware on consumers' computers. This has proved effective in curtailing Flash exploits in the web browser, so to make the attack work, BlackOasis appeared to have embedded a Flash file in a Microsoft Word document, because this stops the typical protections from working. Mr Raiu thinks that Microsoft should consider blocking certain types of files from launching when Word documents are opened. He recommended that consumers install the patch for Flash even if they don't think they are using it on their computers, because it might still be installed.  ""The most worrying thing in this story is that tools produced by these companies specialising in lawful surveillance are being used to fuel cross-country espionage and contribute to the increasing climate of world cyber war,"" said Mr Raiu. ""The creator of the tool is a UK company, and then it is used to spy on British targets. I just find the whole concept a bit worrying.""

WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, said the attack targeted a ""select number"" of users and was orchestrated by ""an advanced cyber-actor"".  A fix was rolled out on Friday.  On Monday, WhatsApp urged all of its 1.5 billion users to update their apps as an added precaution.  The surveillance software involved was developed by Israeli firm  NSO Group , according to a report in the  Financial Times .  Why the WhatsApp spies may have eyes on Iran Facebook first discovered the flaw in WhatsApp earlier in May. WhatsApp promotes itself as a ""secure"" communications app because messages are  end-to-end encrypted , meaning they should only be displayed in a legible form on the sender or recipient's device.  However, the surveillance software would have let an attacker read the messages on the target's device. Some users of the app have questioned why the app store notes associated with the latest update are not explicit about the fix. image copyright Twitter ""Journalists, lawyers, activists and human rights defenders"" are most likely to have been targeted, said  Ahmed Zidan  from the non-profit Committee to Protect Journalists. How do I update WhatsApp? Android Open the  Google Play  store Tap the menu at the top left of the screen Tap My Apps & Games If WhatsApp has recently been updated, it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated, the button will say Update. Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on Android is 2.19.134 iOS Open the  App Store At the bottom of the screen, tap Updates If WhatsApp has recently been updated, it will appear in the list of apps with a button that says Open If WhatsApp has not been automatically updated, the button will say Update. Tap Update to install the new version The latest version of WhatsApp on iOS is 2.19.51 How was the security flaw used? It involved attackers using WhatsApp's voice calling function to ring a target's device.  Even if the call was not picked up, the surveillance software could be installed. According to the FT report, the call would often disappear from the device's call log.  WhatsApp told the BBC its security team was the first to identify the flaw. It shared that information with human rights groups, selected security vendors and the US Department of Justice earlier this month.  ""The attack has all the hallmarks of a private company reportedly that works with governments to deliver spyware that takes over the functions of mobile phone operating systems,â the company said on Monday in a briefing document note for journalists.  What is encryption? What we know about the secretive NSO Group The firm also published an  advisory to security specialists , in which it described the flaw as: ""A buffer overflow vulnerability in WhatsApp VOIP [voice over internet protocol] stack allowed remote code execution via specially crafted series of SRTCP [secure real-time transport protocol] packets sent to a target phone number.â  Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey said it was a ""pretty old-fashioned"" method of attack. ""A buffer overflow is where a program runs into memory it should not have access to.  It overflows the memory it should have and hence has access to memory in which malicious code can potentially be run,"" he explained. ""If you are able to pass some code through the app, you can run your own code in that area. ""In VOIP there is an initial process that dials up and establishes the call, and the flaw was in that bit. Consequently you did not need to answer the call for the attack to work."" Who is behind the software? The NSO Group is an Israeli company that has been referred to in the past as a ""cyber-arms dealer"".  While some cyber-security companies report the flaws they find so that they can be fixed, others keep problems to themselves so they can be exploited or sold to law enforcement.  The NSO Group is  part-owned by the London-based private equity firm Novalpina Capital , which acquired a stake in February. NSO's flagship software, Pegasus, has the ability to collect intimate data from a target device, including capturing data through the microphone and camera, and gathering location data.  In a statement, the group said: ""NSO's technology is licensed to authorised government agencies for the sole purpose of fighting crime and terror.  On the frontline of India's WhatsApp fake news war WhatsApp sets new rules after mob killings ""The company does not operate the system, and after a rigorous licensing and vetting process, intelligence and law enforcement determine how to use the technology to support their public safety missions. We investigate any credible allegations of misuse and if necessary, we take action, including shutting down the system.  ""Under no circumstances would NSO be involved in the operating or identifying of targets of its technology, which is solely operated by intelligence and law enforcement agencies. NSO would not or could not use its technology in its own right to target any person or organisation."" Who has been targeted? WhatsApp said it was too early to know how many users had been affected by the vulnerability, although it added that suspected attacks were highly-targeted.   According to the  New York Times , one of the people targeted was a London-based lawyer involved in a lawsuit against the NSO Group. Amnesty International, which said it had been targeted by tools created by the NSO Group in the past, said this attack was one human rights groups had long feared was possible. ""They're able to infect your phone without you actually taking an action,"" said Danna Ingleton, deputy programme director for Amnesty Tech. She said there was mounting evidence that the tools were being used by regimes to keep prominent activists and journalists under surveillance. ""There needs to be some accountability for this, it can't just continue to be a wild west, secretive industry."" On Tuesday, a Tel Aviv court will hear a petition led by Amnesty International that calls for Israel's Ministry of Defence to revoke the NSO Group's licence to export its products. What are the unanswered questions? How many people were targeted?  WhatsApp says it is too early in its investigation to say how many people were targeted, or how long the flaw was present in the app Does updating WhatsApp remove the spyware?

Germany, perhaps the most privacy conscious nation on earth, is considering a mobile phone app that would trace the contacts of anyone infected with Covid-19.  Earlier this week the British Prime Minister  shared a picture of an online Cabinet meeting , complete with the Zoom meeting ID and the usernames of ministers. And millions of us are sharing views of our kitchens over this and other video-conferencing apps, without apparently being too concerned about poor privacy controls. Meanwhile, the National Health Service in England has sent out a document that appears to mark a shift in its policy on patient data,  giving staff more latitude to share information relating to the coronavirus . In particular, it mentions the use of data to understand trends in the spread and impact of the virus and ""and the management of patients with or at risk of Covid-19 including: locating, contacting, screening, flagging and monitoring such patients"".  In other words, hospital staff and GPs, who until now may have been cautious almost to the point of paranoia about data protection, can chill out a little.  Stream  or  download  the latest  Tech Tent  podcast Listen live every Friday at 14:00 GMT on the BBC World Service As someone who has previously been asked by my optician to take pictures on my phone of an eye scan and take them to a hospital doctor because they were not permitted to email them, the new policy seems sensible. So are we becoming more relaxed about privacy because of the pandemic, or are we in danger of allowing governments and corporations to trample over our rights using the excuse of the emergency? The former Portuguese Europe Minister Bruno Macaes, now a writer and commentator, made it clear where he stands in this startling tweet: The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter The idea that any concern about privacy in the battle against the virus is not only irrelevant but could prove fatal is at one extreme of this argument.  At the other are some privacy campaigners, who appear to think that any form of monitoring people with the virus risks the creation of a surveillance state. We can see this battle playing out in the debate over the contact-tracing apps now being considered by a number of European countries, including the UK.  A press conference with a consortium of European scientists aiding their development began with a clear declaration about putting privacy at their core. Hans-Christian Boos, an AI entrepreneur and adviser to Chancellor Merkel, is one of the initiative's leaders. He said one of the motivating factors was to address the question: ""Can we really build proximity-tracing while preserving privacy completely?""  It is possible, they concluded, if the system is built round the use of Bluetooth signals and anonymous IDs. Singapore's TraceTogether, which already does this, is being cited as a good example. But some countries are taking a less cautious approach.  Russia's Social Monitoring app for citizens who have tested positive for Covid-19 , will request access to calls, location, camera, storage, network information and other data to check they do not leave their home while contagious. Taiwan has been using network data to monitor citizens in quarantine,  in one case resulting in a man getting a visit from the police 45 minutes  after his phone went flat. And perhaps the most extreme option is a software tool being touted by the Israeli spyware firm NSO Group.  It envisages governments telling mobile phone operators to hand over all their data on the movements of every subscriber .  When I asked an NHS official whether such an approach would be feasible here, I could almost hear him turn white over the phone.  A SIMPLE GUIDE:   How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:  The rules on self-isolation and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:  Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:  Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:  The 20-second hand wash The team working on an app for the UK is acutely conscious that it needs to retain the trust of the public if they are to achieve a target of getting about 60% of the population to install it when released.  Telling citizens their government will be logging their every move would be a clear deterrent . But here's the problem. Getting apps and other technology solutions out there fast, while cutting a few privacy corners, could mean that lockdowns and the other restrictions on daily life might be be eased earlier.  Countries like the UK which are more cautious about privacy are likely to be slower in rolling out contact-tracing technology - and that may mean they are locked down for longer. So, might the public be willing to trade one kind of freedom -  the right to privacy - for another - the right to leave their homes and return to work?  As with so many areas of our lives, the virus is forcing us to confront difficult questions about our priorities.

Since Disney+ went live, attackers have stolen thousands of customers' accounts and put them up for sale on the dark web,  according to a report .  People waited on telephone and online chat lines for hours, and many still say that Disney has yet to sort their problems.  But the firm says it does not believe its systems have been compromised. ""Disney takes the privacy and security of our users' data very seriously and there is no indication of a security breach on Disney+,"" a spokesman said. The statement indicates that members' details have been stolen by other means. That could involve spyware on users' devices or the re-use of login details stolen from elsewhere. Disney's answer to Netflix, Disney+ is an online platform where fans can view its movies, short films and TV shows, including the Marvel and Star Wars franchises.  Ten million people signed up in its first week.  Disney+ has not yet launched in the UK, but is available in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands. Dark web On 12 November, its first day live, people had technical problems and many complained on social media. Others said they were locked out of their accounts, and since they contacted Disney they have not heard back.  According to  an investigation by Zdnet , thousands of user accounts went on sale on the dark web.  Only hours after the service launched, hackers were selling Disney+ accounts for as little as $3 (Â£2.30). A subscription to the service costs $7 (Â£5.40) a month.  With the help of a cyber-security researcher, the BBC also found several hacked customer accounts for sale on the dark web.  image caption More than 4,000 customer accounts appeared in the search Thousands of these stolen accounts show what kind of subscription the person signed up with and when it expires.  Customers say they saw their emails and passwords changed.  image caption Ads on the dark web for stolen Disney+ accounts Many say they used unique userIDs and passwords to access the streaming platform.  But Jason Hill, a lead researcher with CyberInt, says it looks like many were stolen because people use the same passwords for different sites.  Mr Hill said that hackers can lift someone's password from a different site which has previously been hacked and then try it on a new site, like Disney+. If it works, they steal the account. ""Whilst many may consider having a unique password for each online service to be difficult to manage, password managers simplify this process and allow you to generate and securely store unique difficult-to-guess passwords,"" he said.  The streaming service does not have two-factor authentication.  This is when a separate password is sent upon login, to verify an account identity.  So not only does this suck but it also goes towards something I was noticing with Disney+ the security seems from the same era as the first lion king film. That is to say lacking.

Turkish media identified Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb as being part of a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents who flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance from the city's Saudi consulate on 2 October. He is said to have spent two years working in London, with a source describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence to US news network CNN. And now BBC Arabic can reveal he was trained how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Saudi Arabia profile  The source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, has visually confirmed his identity from pictures circulated in the media in the days since Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. According to him, Mr Mutreb was introduced as ""an intelligence security operative"". The spyware trainers, however, nicknamed him ""dark face"". ""Because he looked always grumpy, like he was on the sad sideâ¦ he was very silent,"" the source added. Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to Mr Khashoggi, insisting he left the consulate soon after getting routine paperwork. Trained to target citizens The European surveillance expert described how Mr Mutreb spent two weeks on a course with him in 2011, learning how to use the technology his company was providing the Saudi government so that it could carry out targeted attacks on the phones and computers of its own citizens.  ""The training involved things like infecting a computer from potential targets of interest for intelligence and extracting information, so digital evidence, information about this person of interest. image copyright AFP image caption CCTV footage from Istanbul airport purports to show Maher Mutreb on 2 October ""This information might have been basically everything from [their] GPS position, conversation, microphone audio around the device itself, camera pictures, files on disk, emails, contacts, everything that was on the device itself."" During the training, which was in a military compound in the suburbs of Riyadh, the surveillance expert says Mr Mutreb ""used to come and go"" and ""almost didn't speak at all"". ""He wasn't one of the guys who was particularly skilled on the technical side,"" the spyware trainer explained.  ""The group was split between those doing physical intelligenceâ¦ so cameras, microphones etc, and another group of people that were doing digital surveillanceâ¦ I believe that this guy was more on the physical surveillance than the digital surveillance."" image copyright Getty Images image caption A man identified as Maher Mutreb can be seen in the far right of a photo from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March The tools he was trained in, the source said, were similar to other tools which, according to Citizenlab and Amnesty International, were recently used against several of Mr Khashoggi's friends. Paper trail Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London.  A document published by the British government in 2007  listed a man with that name as first secretary. However, he has also been named as a Saudi intelligence officer by several individuals, and some leaked documents. CNN spoke to a Saudi source in London who said he knew Mr Mutreb , describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers - lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court. On October 12 Wikileaks tweeted the Khashoggi Files, which included emails with the name of Mutreb and five other men who were supposed to have attended a course in Italy in 2011, run by an Italian company called Hacking Team. The emails were part of a dump of 400GB of data first released by Wikileaks in July 2015, which Hacking Team say was stolen from their internal network.  The emails also included conversations that suggested the intelligence agencies Hacking Team worked with used it to spy on activists and journalists.

""Then they came for me, and there was no one left to speak for me."" Professor Teltumbde often quoted these iconic words from German Lutheran Pastor Martin Niemoller, criticising silence when faced with evil, in his books and speeches. On Wednesday, when he turns 70 in a Mumbai jail where he's been imprisoned for 90 days, his family and friends are trying to ensure that he's not greeted with silence. Scores of letters and cards wishing him well on his birthday are expected to be delivered at Taloja jail where he's being held. ""Anand is a respected academic who's been shut away for completely dubious reasons,"" Balmurli Natrajan, professor of anthropology at William Paterson University in New Jersey, who is among the people writing a letter to Prof Teltumbde, told the BBC. ""We want him to know that we are constantly thinking of him, reading his books."" Counted among India's best-known public intellectuals, Prof Teltumbde has authored 30 books and is known for his incisive writing on India's harsh caste system. Born to a Dalit (formerly untouchables in India's rigid caste system) family, he worked in top positions in some of India's biggest oil companies before moving to academia. At present, he's head of the Big Data programme at the prestigious Goa Institute of Management. A trenchant critic of the government, he's described Prime Minister Narendra Modi as ""more dangerous than Hitler and Mussolini"" and a ""narcissist par excellence"". image copyright Siddhesh Gautam image caption Dalit artist Siddhesh Gautam's drawing of Prof Teltumbde and 10 other activists jailed in connection with the Bhima Koregaon violence On 14 April, when  Prof Teltumbde turned himself in to federal investigators  on court orders, he joined 10 other activists, poets and lawyers who have been arrested in connection with what is known as the Bhima Koregaon case.  They are being held under the UAPA (Unlawful Activities Prevention Act) - an anti-terrorism law that makes it almost impossible to get bail. Police accuse them of instigating caste violence at a Dalit rally in Bhima Koregaon village in the western state of Maharashtra on 1 January 2018.  Although those detained weren't present in the village at the time, police blamed the violence on their speeches at a meeting the night before. They are also accused of working in tandem with the Naxalites - banned ultra-left Maoist rebels - to ""overthrow the government and cause chaos in India"". Indian academic surrenders over violence charges But Indian and international campaigners and rights organisations working for their release say they've been jailed for criticising the state. ""All the 11 activists have worked relentlessly to protect the rights of some of India's most marginalised people, including Dalits and tribals,"" Amnesty International said in one of the several statements it has put out in the past few months calling for their release. Human Rights Watch  has called the detentions ""wrongful"" and ""politically motivated"" and questioned why the government did not investigate the allegations that Hindu nationalist leaders may have had a role in the Bhima Koregaon violence?  In May, the European Parliament Subcommittee on Human Rights wrote to Home Minister Amit Shah saying it was alarmed by the ""intimidation and harassment of human rights defenders"" by the authorities. The letter also urged India to immediately release all prisoners  in view of the coronavirus pandemic - most of the detainees are elderly with underlying health conditions and thus at serious risk of catching the infection in overcrowded jails.  image copyright Getty Images image caption A day after a Dalit rally was attacked in Bhima Koregaon in January 2018, protests spilled out onto the streets of Mumbai Prof Natrajan says India has always been ""a marketplace of ideas"", pointing out that Nobel laureate Amartya Sen once called Indians ""argumentative"". But in the past eight years, the space for argument and debate has been shrinking. Prof Teltumbde, he says, has been setting the contours of key debates on globalisation and politics of caste and religion for the past 30 years. ""He's been calling out caste deniers and Hindu triumphalism. He's dared to point fingers at the powerful classes - he's telling them, 'here's what you're doing and how it's put a majority of Indian people in misery'. And that makes him a dangerous man."" Prof Teltumbde, says his wife Rama, was shocked when his name first came up two years back in the list of accused in the Bhima Koregaon case. ""We hadn't even imagined it in our worst dreams that something like this could ever happen to us,"" she told me on the phone from Mumbai. ""My husband is not a criminal,"" she says, her voice breaking with emotion. ""He's an academic, a workaholic who spent 14-15 hours daily reading, writing and teaching."" In his free time, she says, he would try to help the poor and the marginalised because he wanted to see an India that's better, more just. ""To be thrown into jail for that is a very high price to pay."" Since her husband has been jailed, Mrs Teltumbde has been allowed a weekly two-minute phone call with him. India jails pregnant student despite Covid-19 risk ""I always ask him how's his health? And how's the prison food because I know the food there is very bad. He doesn't want to worry us, so he always says he's fine. And then he asks about his mother and our daughters."" Mrs Teltumbde is the granddaughter of Bhimrao Ambedkar - the author of India's constitution and an icon to millions of Dalits - and says she believes that her grandfather wouldn't recognise today's India. ""I don't think he envisaged this kind of India where people are arrested for speaking their mind. We live in a democracy and freedom of speech is a right guaranteed under the constitution."" But critics say it's a right that is under grave threat in today's India. Those criticising PM Modi are attacked on social media by nationalist trolls, and activists and students opposing the government are being jailed. Most of the dissenters are charged under UAPA and being held in prison without bail. Earlier this year, police in Delhi arrested several students who had protested against a controversial new citizenship law that critics say discriminates against Muslims. They were labelled as ""anti-nationals working to break up India"" by news channels friendly to the government. Female activists were slut-shamed on social media. While most continue to languish in overcrowded prisons,  Safoora Zargar, a pregnant female student , was freed after three months in jail following global condemnation.  image caption A letter written by a 10-year-old student to Prof Anand Teltumbde on his birthday ""The government is playing with the liberties of people by arresting them under flimsy charges,"" says Mihir Desai, Prof Teltumbde's lawyer. ""The central charge against Prof Teltumbde,"" he says, ""is that he was helping the Naxalites by getting them recruits and spreading their ideology and that he was taking money from them."" But when they raided his house, he says, they did not find any arms or cash. The only evidence the police have put forth so far are four ""letters"" that they waved at a press conference. Mr Desai says they are typed and unsigned and there are no addresses or email addresses on them. He says they are not written by Prof Teltumbde or addressed to him - the one thing they all have in common is the mention of an ""Anand"" which is a common Indian name. ""These letters appear to be manufactured,"" he says adding that ""even if they are real, how do they prove that this Anand is Prof Teltumbde? Also, anyone can write anything to anyone, but is that proof? These can't exist as evidence."" The evidence is unlikely to stand scrutiny in court, Mr Desai says, but it's the process that's the punishment. ""If a person is jailed for 10 years while the case goes on, their life is ruined.""  As Prof Teltumbde completes three months in prison, his wife Rama says their only demand is for him to be freed on bail and the government to start the trial soon so that ""his name can be cleared"". A day before he was taken into custody,  Prof Teltumbde wrote an open letter  where he detailed the harassment he says he's faced in the past two years - he wrote about how his home was raided, his Wikipedia page was vandalised, and how the  government inserted Israeli spyware on his phone .  ""As I see my India being ruined, it is with a feeble hope that I write to you at such a grim momentâ¦ I do not know when I shall be able to talk to you again. ""However, I earnestly hope that you will speak out before your turn comes,"" he wrote. By jailing him, Prof Natrajan says, the government is trying to crush the very people who are trying to reason and debate. ""But mark my words, Anand will not be crushed. You can jail people, torture them, kill them, but you cannot beat ideas.""

They said Mohammed bin Salman should also be investigated for ""continuous, direct and personal efforts to target perceived opponents"". A message from a phone number used by the prince has been implicated in a breach of Mr Bezos's data. The kingdom's US embassy has denied the ""absurd"" story. But the independent UN experts - Agnes Callamard, special rapporteur on summary executions and extrajudicial killings, and David Kaye, special rapporteur on freedom of expression - said the crown prince's ""possible involvement"" had to be investigated. Relations between Saudi Arabia and Mr Bezos - who also owns the Washington Post - worsened after Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of the Saudi government and one of the newspaper's staff, was murdered in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in 2018. Saudis sentence five over Khashoggi murder How Saudi Arabia's crown prince rose to power The killing took place months after the alleged cyber-hack took place. Mr Bezos's phone was hacked after he received a WhatsApp message in May 2018 that was sent from the crown prince's personal account,  according to the Guardian newspaper, which broke the story. An investigation into the data breach reportedly found that the billionaire's phone began secretly sharing huge amounts of data after he received the encrypted video file. What did the experts say? In a statement, Ms Callamard and Mr Kaye said: ""The information we have received suggests the possible involvement of the crown prince in surveillance of Mr Bezos, in an effort to influence, if not silence, the Washington Post's reporting on Saudi Arabia."" It said the allegations reinforced ""other reporting pointing to a pattern of targeted surveillance of perceived opponents and those of broader strategic importance to the Saudi authorities"". Was Jeff Bezos the weak link in cyber-security? Saudi Arabia accused over Bezos hack What happened to Jamal Khashoggi? The experts linked the case heavily to the Khashoggi murder, saying the Post reporter's phone had been hacked at the same time as Mr Bezos's. They said there had been ""a massive, clandestine online campaign against Mr Bezos and Amazon, apparently targeting him principally as the owner of the Washington Post"". The statement also called for ""rigorous control"" of the ""unconstrained marketing, sale and use of spyware"". How did the alleged hack take place? The UN experts cited ""a 2019 forensic analysis of Mr Bezos' iPhone that assessed with 'medium to high confidence' that his phone was infiltrated on 1 May 2018 via an MP4 video file sent from a WhatsApp account utilised personally by Mohammed bin Salman"". media caption Mohammed bin Salman is asked: ""Did you order the murder of Jamal Khashoggi?"" The crown prince and Mr Bezos had reportedly exchanged numbers a month earlier and within hours of the MP4's arrival, there was a ""massive and unprecedented exfiltration of data"" from Mr Bezos's phone. The analysis cited by the experts says the crown prince then ""sent WhatsApp messages to Mr Bezos... in which he allegedly revealed private and confidential information about Mr Bezos' personal life"". Private information was then leaked to the American tabloid, the National Enquirer. In February 2019 Mr Bezos accused it of ""extortion and blackmail"" after it published text messages between him and his girlfriend, former Fox television presenter Lauren SÃ¡nchez. A month earlier he and MacKenzie Bezos, his wife of 25 years, had announced that they planned to divorce having been separated for a ""long period"". What have the Saudis and Bezos said? The Twitter account of the kingdom's US embassy  issued an outright denial of the allegations against the crown prince. ""We call for an investigation on these claims so that we can have all the facts out,"" the embassy said. Mr Bezos has made no response to the UN experts' statement, but did tweet an image of himself with Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, along with the tag #Jamal: #Jamal   pic.twitter.com/8ej1rUBXVb — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos)  January 22, 2020   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter image copyright Reuters Phone hacking 'all too common' Analysis by Jane Wakefield, BBC News technology reporter A hack such as this was ""horribly easy to do once the vulnerability involved had been discovered,"" says computer expert Prof Alan Woodward. The seemingly innocent video would have contained malware that surreptitiously installed itself on the targeted phone. From there it would have been possible for the hacker to gain access to all the functions of the phone, from the GPS locator, to the camera, to the banking facilities and messaging apps. Such access is made possible via bugs in the code and, last year,  a security flaw in WhatsApp was revealed  that would have allowed hackers to hide malicious code inside video files.  Phone hacking is, says Prof Woodward, all too common in certain countries that are keen to keep an eye on journalists, dissidents and other activists perceived to be a threat to their regimes. So-called stalkerware is available off the shelf to these governments. But what about the involvement of the Saudi crown prince? Was it really him who installed the malware? It is unlikely that he set the phone up himself. So was his phone also being spied on? Or was he simply a vessel being used by the Saudi authorities? The plot thickens.

Peel said her decision came ""in light of a concerted lobbying campaign against my husband's recent investment"" referencing ""toxic, personal attacks"". Peel's husband is an owner of investment company Novalpina Capital Management International, which invests in controversial Israeli tech firm NSO. Amnesty International  has criticised  NSO's use of surveillance technology. In a statement, Serpentine Galleries said Peel ""will be sorely missed. The arts sector will be poorer without her immeasurable contributions to our cultural lives."" Peel said in her statement: ""The work of the Serpentine... cannot be allowed to be undermined by misguided personal attacks on me and my family. These attacks are based upon inaccurate media reports now subject to legal complaints.  ""I have decided I am better able to continue my work in supporting the arts, the advancement of human rights and freedom of expression by moving away from my current role."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Grayson Perry held an exhibition at the Serpentine in 2017 She added: ""The world of art is about free expression. But it is not about bullying and intimidation. I welcome debate and discussion about the realities of life in the digital age. There is a place for these debates, but they should be constructive, fair and factual - not based upon toxic personal attacks."" Mrs Peel owns one-third of the Novalpina holding company but her representatives stress she has only a single-digit percentage, indirect interest in the relevant fund and no role in operational or investment decisions. Novalpina began funding NSO Group Technologies earlier this year. 'Exemplary job' NSO has previously been  accused of selling spyware  called Pegasus to agencies which use it to monitor human rights activists. But the group insists that its products have been used by law enforcement agencies in the battle against terrorism and wider criminal behaviour. According to its own website,  NSO Group  ""provides the tools that support official authorities to lawfully address the most dangerous issues in today's world. Governments use our products to prevent terrorism, break up criminal operations, find missing persons, and assist search and rescue teams."" Following an exchange of letters with human rights organisation Amnesty,  Novalpina issued a statement  last week announcing ""a new framework"" to ""bring NSO Group in full alignment with UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights"". It continued: ""Novalpina and NSO will do whatever necessary to ensure NSO's technology is used only for its intended lawful purpose - the prevention of harm to our fundamental human rights to life, liberty and security from acts of terrorism and serious crime."" The University of Toronto's Citizen Lab monitors digital attacks against civil society and has been tracking the NSO Group for several years. In a letter published on Tuesday , Citizen Lab said it had ""sent multiple letters to Novalpina Capital LLP and NSO Group seeking specific answers regarding a number of concerns, including at least 31 reports of abusive targeting. These questions remain largely unanswered"". The Serpentine said it was ""with a mix of gratitude and regret that the board of trustees of the Serpentine Galleries has accepted the resignation of CEO Yana Peel. ""Since taking on the role in 2016, Yana has done an exemplary job furthering the mission, visibility, and financial standing of the Serpentine, increasing support and donations, overseeing ground-breaking exhibitions, and expanding the Serpentine's programme internationally year over year."" Peel oversaw programmes from artists such as Grayson Perry and Rose Wylie and commissioned touring exhibitions to Milan, Miami, Paris, Berlin, Chicago, New York and Hong Kong.  Correction 1 April 2020: An earlier version of this article said that Yana Peel was listed on company records as an indirect owner of Novalpina. This has been since amended to explain that at the time of publication she owned one-third of a holding company, Novalpina Capital Group. Ms Peel's representatives have explained this means she had no control or involvement in the Novalpina Capital investment fund, which acquired a stake in NSO Group.

Mr Itani was suspected of gathering information on Lebanese politicians with a view to passing it on to Israel.  Lebanon technically remains at war with Israel and collaborating is punishable by death.  Mr Itani was detained in November on charges of ""collaborating and communicating with the Israeli enemy"".

Trimaan Dhillon cut 24-year-old Alice Ruggles' throat after breaking into her Gateshead flat in October 2016. A review has found Northumbria Police and the Army failed to properly address signs of L/Cpl Dhillon's jealous and obsessive behaviour. Dhillon, 26, was jailed for a minimum of 22 years after a trial last year .  A  domestic homicide review , carried out by Gateshead Community Safety Board, concluded Miss Ruggles was subjected to ""significant stalking"" and that Army officials failed to record a previous domestic assault charge against Dhillon in Kent. The review heard Miss Ruggles, who was originally from Tur Langton, near Market Harborough in Leicestershire and worked for Sky, had contacted Northumbria Police about Dhillon's stalking in the days before her death. In one a call handler asked Miss Ruggles if she wanted him to be arrested, but she declined. The review found police should have made that decision and it should not have been left to the victim. The review noted that a police officer did contact Dhillon's barracks in Edinburgh and spoke to a superior, but not Military Police or Police Scotland, and Dhillon was then told by the regiment to stop contacting her or face arrest. But he ignored the warning and eventually drove 120 miles to Tyneside to murder Miss Ruggles. image caption Trimaan Dhillon, known as Harry, had been subject to a restraining order after attacking a previous partner The report concluded: ""The perpetrator's willingness to travel provided an indication of the level of his obsessive behaviour that was overlooked. ""In addition, there was a lack of clarity about the roles and responsibilities of the Home Office, police and armed forces, which led to some confusion about how best to deal with the perpetrator."" The review made 20 recommendations, including making it an offence to threaten to release intimate photos of an ex-partner, as Dhillon did when Miss Ruggles called off their relationship. It also urged the Home Office to review the effectiveness of the police 101 non-emergency number, after it emerged Miss Ruggles abandoned a call to Northumbria Police after being kept on hold for almost seven minutes. The review described the incident as a ""missed opportunity to support Alice"". Last year the the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC)  said two Northumbria officers had cases of misconduct to answer while another had performed unsatisfactorily . It also found the force treated the matter as harassment rather than stalking. The force has since apologised to Miss Ruggles' parents, Sue Hill and Clive Ruggles. The review also called on the Home Office to review the legality of spyware after concerns about the ease in which Dhillon was able to hack Miss Ruggles' social media accounts. Responding to the report, Ms Hill and Mr Ruggles said: ""Alice died in tragic circumstances and it is important that failings are acknowledged, lessons learned, and improvements made.   ""We hope that the Army will now realise that they have an important part to play when one of their soldiers is accused of criminal behaviour against a civilian and, like other agencies, will proceed to learn lessons from Alice's case."" image copyright Phil Mawson image caption Alice Ruggles' parents said they believed their daughter's death was preventable Brigadier Christopher Coles, head of Army personnel services group, said: ""We are committed to tacking domestic abuse and last year launched a strategy to help prevent domestic abuse in all its forms.  ""This includes prevention of abuse in the home and providing support to the families of service personnel who may be affected."" Northumbria Police's assistant chief constable Rachel Bacon said: ""With the help of Alice's family we are now leading the way in training officers in the best way to deal with these types of offences.

But the widow of one man who died after developing sepsis told the BBC she was ""angry"" at the delay in treating him with antibiotics. Hayley Scott said her husband, Simon, waited six days to get treated, despite his hospital notes suggesting he should have been on them from day two.

spyware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-48282092|"WhatsApp hack: Is any app or computer truly secure? Published 15 May 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright EPA WhatsApp has confirmed that a security flaw in the app let attackers install spy software on their targets' smartphones. That has left many of its 1.5 billion users wondering how safe the ""simple and secure"" messaging app really is. On Wednesday, chip-maker Intel confirmed that new problems discovered with some of its processors could reveal secret information to attacks. How trustworthy are apps and devices? Was WhatsApp's encryption broken? No. Messages on WhatsApp are end-to-end encrypted, meaning they are scrambled when they leave the sender's device. The messages can be decrypted by the recipient's device only. That means law enforcement, service providers and cyber-criminals cannot read any messages they intercept as they travel across the internet. However, there are some caveats.  Messages can be read before they are encrypted or after they are decrypted. That means any spyware dropped on the phone by an attacker could read the messages. media caption What is encryption? On Tuesday, news site  Bloomberg  published an opinion article calling WhatsApp's encryption ""pointless"", given the security breach. However, that viewpoint has been widely ridiculed by cyber-security experts. ""I don't think it's helpful to say end-to-end encryption is pointless just because a vulnerability is occasionally found,"" said Dr Jessica Barker from the cyber-security company Cygenta. ""Encryption is a good thing that does offer us protection in most cases."" Cyber-security is often a game of cat and mouse. End-to-end encryption makes it much harder for attackers to read messages, even if they do eventually find a way to access some of them. What about back-ups? WhatsApp gives the option to back up chats to Google Drive or iCloud but those back-up copies are not protected by the end-to-end encryption. An attacker could access old chats if they broke into a cloud storage account. How to stay safe on WhatsApp WhatsApp discovers 'targeted' surveillance attack Of course, even if users decide not to back up chats, the people they message may still upload a copy to their cloud storage. Should people stop using WhatsApp? Ultimately, any app could contain a security vulnerability that leaves a phone open to attackers. WhatsApp is owned by Facebook, which typically issues software fixes quickly. Of course, even large companies can make mistakes and Facebook has had its share of data and privacy breaches over the years. There is no guarantee a rival chat app would not experience a similar security lapse.  At least, following the disclosure of this flaw, WhatsApp is slightly more secure than it was a week ago. image copyright Signal image caption Signal is an open-source project Some rival chat apps are open-source projects, which means anybody can look at the code powering the app and suggest improvements. ""Open-source software has its value in that it be can tested more widely but it doesn't necessarily mean it's more secure,"" said Dr Barker. ""Vulnerabilities can still be found with any tech, so it's not the answer to our prayers."" And if someone did decide to switch to a rival chat app, they would still have to convince their contacts to do the same. A chat app without friends is not much use. Is any device ever safe? In theory, any device or service could be hacked. In fact, security researchers often joyfully pile in on companies that claim their products are ""unhackable"". They quickly discover vulnerabilities and the embarrassed companies retract their claims. If people are worried data may be stolen from their computer, one option is to ""air gap"" the device: disconnect it from the internet entirely. That stops remote hackers accessing the machine - but even an air gap would not stop an attacker with physical access to the device. Dr Barker stressed the importance of installing software updates for apps and operating systems. ""WhatsApp pushed out an update and consumers might not have realised that security fixes are often included in updates,"" she told BBC News. WhatsApp did not help the cause, however, by describing the latest update as adding ""full-size stickers"", and not mentioning the security breach. ""People need to be made aware that updates are really important. The quicker we can update our apps, the more secure we are,"" said Dr Barker. As always, there are simple security steps to remember: Install app and operating system security updates  Use a different password for every app or service Where possible, enable two-step authentication to stop attackers logging in to accounts Be careful about what apps you download Do not click links in emails or messages you are not expecting Related Topics Facebook Cyber-security WhatsApp More on this story WhatsApp discovers surveillance attack Published 14 May 2019"

The accusation follows a report in the New York Times that says they were targeted with spyware meant to be used against criminals and terrorists. The newspaper says messages examined by forensic analysts show the software was used against government critics. A Mexican government spokesman ""categorically"" denied the allegations. The report says that the software, known as Pegasus, was sold to Mexican federal agencies by Israeli company NSO Group on the condition that it only be used to investigate criminals and terrorists. The software can infiltrate smartphones and monitor calls, texts and other communications,  the New York Times said.  It can also activate a phone's microphone or camera, effectively turning the device into a personal bug. But instead of being used to track suspected criminals, the targets allegedly included investigative journalists, anti-corruption activists and even lawyers. How does the software work? A link is usually sent in a message to a smartphone. If the person taps on it, the spyware is installed, and huge amounts of private data - text messages, photos, emails, location data, even what is being picked up by the device's microphone and camera - is hacked Very little is known about NSO Group, the secretive Israel-based company behind Pegasus, but security researchers have called it a cyber arms dealer. The company was thought to be worth $1bn (Â£780m) in 2015 The company has acknowledged that it sells tools to governments but has given very little details about who its customers are. It has said, however, that it has no control over how its tools are used and for what purpose Read more here Nine people have now filed a criminal complaint. At a news conference in Mexico City, journalist Carmen Aristegui accused the state of criminal activity.  ""The agents of the Mexican state, far from doing what they should be doing legally, have used our resources, our taxes, our money to commit serious crimes,"" she said. A spokesman for President Enrique PeÃ±a Nieto rejected the allegations, saying that the government carries out intelligence work against the organised crime and threats to the national security in accordance with the country's laws, but that it does not include journalists or activists.

Pieces of global opinion Published 31 October 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock A review of the best commentary on and around the world... Today's must-read ""The FBI will not have to bug your living room; you will do it yourself.""  So says  Michael Price of Salon.com, the nervous new owner of a ""smart"" TV - a web-connected telly that recognises his face, listens to his voice, and could send that information (and more, including emails he receives) to a third party. ""Got that? Don't say personal or sensitive stuff in front of the TV,"" writes Price. ""I do not doubt that this data is important to providing customised content and convenience, but it is also incredibly personal, constitutionally protected information that should not be for sale to advertisers and should require a warrant for law enforcement to access."" The  Daily Mail  reports British IT consultant Jason Huntley found his LG smart TV had sent his children's names, unencrypted, over the internet ""because he had watched a family video on his set"". Price explains current laws offer very little privacy protection to the ""third party records"", including data stored in the cloud (although one federal court of appeals has found this rule unconstitutional with respect to email). Speaking about web-based ""smart"" devices, retired General David Petraeus, former head of the CIA, said in 2012 that ""Items of interest will be located, identified, monitor, and remotely controlled through technologies such as radio-frequency identification, sensor networks, tiny embedded servers and energy harvester."" That means, Price argues, as the ""Internet of Things"" matures, household appliances - even your socks - may be wired to interact online.  Of course, it is possible to disable data collection, but that immobilises many of the high-tech functions. ""This leaves consumers with an unacceptable choice between keeping up with technology and retaining their personal privacyâ¦ We should not have to channel surf worried that the TV is recording our behaviour for the benefit of advertisers and police. Companies need to become more mindful of consumer privacy when deciding whether to collect personal data."" Russia A Chinese partner in cyber-security  - Russia and China see eye-to-eye on their increased role in cyber-security, according to Elena Chernenko, Vladislav Novyii and Ivan Safronov in Russia's Kommersant. Both countries support the ""internationalisation"" of internet management, which includes the sovereign right of a government to control internet sites in ""its own national segment"" (the US does not recognize the existence of national segments). Russian President Vladimir Putin will visit Beijing next month, where he is expected to sign a bilateral agreement on cyber-security. This follows several collaborative deals between China and Russia in information technology and communications. In May, the Russian state telecom company signed a $60m (Â£37.5m) contract with Chinese company Huawei to build an underwater communication line in the Russian Far East.  Meanwhile, they say, any US-China partnership is mired in disagreement over US accusations of Chinese industrial and government cyber-espionage Japan An out-of-date economic playbook  - Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has pledged a number of ""third-arrow"" reforms to bring about Japan's resurgence, but Bloomberg's William Pesek says these would have been appropriate 10 to 15 years ago - more modern measures are necessary. Today Japan should provide more support for a start-up boom, the end of Amakudari - ""the equivalent of the revolving door that shifts Wall Street bankers into top Washington jobs and back"" - and more flexible immigration policies. Pesek also says a forward-thinking energy policy, reducing trade barriers and greater gender equality in public-sector leadership roles are necessary if Japan is finally going to turn things around. Libya Little progress three years after Muammar Gaddafi  - The past several months have been a turbulent period of violence, resulting in a divisive political situation, according to Gianluca Eramo of the Libya Herald. The author says in addition to local fighting, neighbouring countries and regional powers are manoeuvring and steering among Libyan militias to gain access, power and control.  ""The international community must urgently develop a concrete political strategy to support the legitimate aspirations of the Libyan people for security, dignity and democracy,"" said Eramo.  Political discourse that focuses on shared, open and fair transitional justice mechanisms can shift attention from the current tendency to look outside the country for political backing and support, says Eramo. ""It can therefore also help reduce the risk of external actors fuelling cycles of violence."" Zimbabwe Little help on Ebola from within  - Almost 40 years after Ebola was first identified, Africa does not have the capacity to play a pivotal role in fighting the virus, argues Brian Sedze of the Standard. The continent, he says, has not invested in research, believing some overseas country would do the research instead.  ""The continent seems to be completely outraged at the international community for what they believe is a lethargic reaction to efforts at containing the Ebola epidemic,"" Sedze adds. ""There are also murmurs of disapproval that the US provided 3,900 soldiers to help in the fight of Ebola instead of medical personnel."" The question, he asks, is how many doctors and nurses did Africa itself provide for this effort. The lack of personnel might be explained by the ever present dependency syndrome. ""While the world was doing all this for us, Africa was busy spending millions sponsoring tribal conflicts, billions of dollars on corruption, funding lavish lifestyles of its corrupt leaders, siphoning billions of dollars to tax havens and sponsoring warped priorities that only encourage political expedience at the cost of lives of its citizens,"" he concludes BBC Monitoring's quotes of the day Israeli columnists react to an unnamed senior US official insulting Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu in an  Atlantic magazine article  earlier this week. ""This is just the latest in a series of vindictive acts by the Obama administration because Israel has dared to reject its diktats... Netanyahu should be commended for withstanding the unreasonable pressure from Obama and Kerry, avoiding outright confrontations and in so doing, retaining the support of American public opinion and Congress."" - Isi Leibler in  Yisrael Hayom . ""The latest attack signals the policy the United States will adopt toward Netanyahu's government following the upcoming congressional elections and in the two years left for Obama at the White House. The tight security and intelligence cooperation will continue, but the diplomatic protection at the UN and international forums will not be immediate and granted."" - Barak Ravid in  Ha'aretz .â Have you found an interesting opinion piece about global issues that we missed?

The Detekt software was needed as standard anti-virus programs often missed spying software, it said. Amnesty said many governments used sophisticated spying tools that could grab images from webcams or listen via microphones to monitor people. It wants to see more regulation of the spying software used by governments. ""These spying tools are marketed on their ability to get round your bog-standard anti-virus,"" said Tanya O'Carroll, an adviser on technology and human rights at Amnesty International. The makers of spying software did extensive testing to ensure that the way they infected and lurked on a computer did not trigger security alerts, she added.  Free of charge Detekt has been developed over the past two years to spot the few telltale signs spying programs do leave. The intense scan it carries out on a hard drive means a computer cannot be used while Detekt is running. Four separate rights groups - Amnesty International, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Privacy International and Digitale Gesellschaft - have worked together to create the spyware spotter, which is available free of charge.  The group is now looking for help to keep Detekt up to date and expand the range of spying programs it can catch. The first version of Detekt has been written to run on Windows computers because the people most often being monitored use that software, said Ms O'Carroll.  Many repressive governments had been using spying software for some time and the programs were becoming increasingly popular with democratically elected governments too, said Ms Carroll. Spying software has been found on the computers of activists in Bahrain, Syria, Ethiopia, Vietnam, Germany, Tibet, North Korea and many other nations. ""It's easier to name the countries that are not using these spying tools than those that are,"" she said.  The trade in spyware used by governments is now a market worth about Â£3bn ($5bn) a year, said Ms O'Carroll, adding it was time for this trade to be better regulated.  Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey, who advises governments on security issues, wondered how easy it would be for Amnesty and its partners to maintain Detekt. ""It's not really their core business,"" he said. ""Are they going to keep updating the software because the spyware variants change daily?"" He also questioned how useful it would be against regimes that used specially written software rather than commercial versions that were well known and documented. ""If a technique is known about widely, those regimes will assume it's going to be ineffective and use another approach,"" he said.  Hidden code image copyright AFP image caption Kim Jong-un's North Korea has been accused of using spyware to keep an eye on critics Claudio Guarnieri, the German security researcher who created Detekt, said there was a growing roster of firms producing spying software.  ""People think the uses of spyware by governments are isolated cases. They are not,"" Mr Guarnieri told the BBC. ""Their discovery is isolated. ""Spyware is becoming the final solution for surveillance operations to overcome encryption.  ""The real problem is nobody really asked the public whether that's acceptable and some countries are legitimising their use without considering the consequences and inherent issues.""  'Strength in numbers' The software is spread in booby-trapped attachments on email messages, by seeding malware on compromised sites or with fake messaging software, said Mr Guarnieri. Karl Zetterlund, a senior researcher at security firm Sentor, said the needs of law enforcement were understandably different to those of the average cyberthief. ""Criminals are mainly interested in information that can somehow generate money. Law enforcement spyware may only need to collect a few pieces of identifying information, such as a net address, from the computer,"" he said.  ""Generally, policeware may be better at hiding, as normal malware often aims for strength in numbers and spreading is more important than passing under the radar."" There had also been cases in the past, he said, when computer security companies collaborated with governments to ignore spyware they found planted on machines.

The crackdown is aimed at making sure essential services such as water, energy, transport and health firms are safeguarded against hacking attempts. Firms will also be required to show they have a strategy to cover power failures and environmental disasters. Digital Minister Matt Hancock said any fines would be a last resort. They would not apply to firms which had put safeguards in place but still suffered an attack, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) said. 'Safest place in the world' Mr Hancock, who is launching a consultation on the plans, said: ""We want the UK to be the safest place in the world to live and be online, with our essential services and infrastructure prepared for the increasing risk of cyber-attack."" The DCMS said firms that take cyber-security seriously should already have measures in place to prevent attacks or systems failures. It said the consultation was aimed at determining how to implement the Network and Information Systems (NIS) directive which becomes law across the EU next May. It is separate from the  General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR ), which are aimed at protecting data, rather than services. The GDPR will replace the UK's Data Protection Act 1998 from 25 May next year and the government has confirmed that the UK's decision to leave the EU will not change this. Earlier this year, NHS services across England and Scotland were hit by a large-scale cyber-attack that disrupted hospital and GP appointments. And the threat to firms from cyber-attacks appears to have grown. Nearly half (46%) of British businesses discovered at least one cyber-security breach or attack in the past year,  a government survey earlier this year found. That proportion rose to two-thirds among medium and large companies. Most often, these breaches involved fraudulent emails being sent to staff or security issues relating to viruses, spyware or malware.

Or sending sexts? Or dealing drugs? There's an app for that.  In the United States, nearly 80% of teenagers own mobile phones. About half of those are smartphones - with access to the internet, games, cameras and social media.  That worries many parents. And those fears are fuelling a growing number of so-called parent apps - to track what kids are doing online.  TeenSafe can work as a personal CIA spy for parents.  The company urges parents to tell their children they are being monitored, but the app can work covertly and show what kids are posting on social media as well as deleted texts and messages sent via popular apps such as Kik, WhatsApp and Snapchat.  image copyright Teensafe image caption Teensafe allows parents to monitor their children's online activity, including deleted messages ""It's absolutely legal for a parent to do this discreetly,"" says TeenSafe's chief executive Rawdon Messenger.  ""The real question is, 'Is it justified?' and those are moral decisions a parent has to make. What we believe is that when it comes to protecting your child from these things - privacy is trumped by protection."" Boundary alerts Mr Messenger says he believes about half the families who use TeenSafe use it to spy on their kids.  TeenSafe operates in the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, and is hoping to expand to the UK soon. Since it started in 2011, it says it has had 800,000 people sign up for the service.  image copyright Mamabear image caption Mamabear's developers say their service is often used by parents who have just given their child their first smartphone Aside from tracking social media use and texting, other parent apps can actually monitor how fast someone is driving or moving in a vehicle as a passenger.  MamaBear offers that service, and co-founder Robyn Spoto says the app is used to link entire families and send alerts when someone is driving above the speed limit or has ventured outside a pre-determined boundary. It cannot be used covertly. ""Technology is your right-hand man to give you the information that you need so that you can have the right conversation,"" says Ms Spoto.  She adds that many families find it reassuring to get push notifications about their children's whereabouts.  Ms Spoto uses MamaBear for her parents and 10-year-old son, who does not have a phone but uses an iPod Touch.  But don't her own parents feel annoyed that their adult daughter gets push notifications every time they speed to work or come home at 01:00 from a party? Laughing, Ms Spoto says they're used to it.  ""It's not like I'm creeping on them,"" she says, adding that she likes the assurance of knowing they got home safely. Teenagers are typically better at using technology than their parents, and apps such as these can create a cat-and-mouse game of kids trying to avoid prying eyes.  But the parent apps are prepared - if your child does not call you back or turns the phone off, you can disable the phone so it only works to call mum or dad.  Stalker apps? image copyright Thinkstock Some call them the ""stalker apps"", worrying that data gathered by smartphone spyware could be misused by suspicious spouses or mistrustful bosses.  And it seems the US authorities share these concerns. Last year the FBI arrested a man for distributing an app called StealthGenie, which intercepted emails and texts as well as recorded phone calls.  image copyright Stealthgenie image caption StealthGenie promoted the fact that it could run on a device without its user being aware Prosecutors highlighted that the software was marketed as being ""undetectable"" and suggested it was designed for ""stalkers and domestic abusers"". In the first ever criminal conviction of its kind, Hammad Akbar  was subsequently fined  $500,000 (Â£332,840) after pleading guilty to advertising and selling the app. Smartphone monitoring services are, however, legal to use in the US, so long as the software is installed on a device used by either the customer's: child - who must be under 18 years old employee - so long as the worker has given their consent and been told they are being monitored Several available products highlight their restrictions in their small print, even if, occasionally, they also market their  ""cheating spouse""-catching potential . ""As far as the UK is concerned, the use of 'stalker apps' could very easily land you on the wrong side of the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and other applicable UK laws ,"" commented Vin Bange from the law firm Taylor Wessing. ""Domestic use is treated very differently to surveillance in the workplace - the latter is a complex area which requires close observation of the law and employee 'consent' cannot be seen as a silver bullet."" When asked if they think their parents are spying on them, a random group of teens at a busy shopping centre in Los Angeles thought it was highly unlikely.  Parents are too busy, they say. They trust them.  image copyright Thinkstock image caption It is increasingly common for young children to have access to internet-connected devices But when I visited a primary school in Los Angeles, where cyber-security expert Lou Rabon was addressing parents at his son's school, many of the parents were open to tracking their kids' every move. ""I would chip them like a dog if I could,"" one mother said.  Many of the parents there thought they were tech-savvy and were shocked to see how easy it was for Mr Rabon to pinpoint their geographic location by the photos they posted on Facebook - he then taught them how to turn off geo-tagging on their camera phones.  They groaned in horror as he showed online messages a predator had posted in a chat room posing as a depressed and lonely 14-year-old girl looking for friends.  'Blind trust' Mr Rabon, who is in the process of creating a parent app of his own, advises parents to use obscure passwords.  One mother told the story of her nine-year-old son who was taught by an older child on the school bus how to get around parental controls on his phone by using a commonly used password in the family.  ""Within minutes he had Googled the word 'sex' and my nine-year-old was on a porn site,"" she told parents at the meeting.  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Parents risk children circumventing the surveillance software they install ""He saw things we hoped he wouldn't see ever or for at least another 10 years.""  It doesn't bode well for parents trying to instil trust and independence in their children.  Mr Rabon says it's naive for parents to blindly trust their kids - and he agrees that in many ways it's a lousy time to be a teenager.  When asked if the next trend would be for teenagers to turn off their phones, he says it wouldn't work - the app he's creating would alert a group of parents if the children in a circle of friends all turned off their phones and would pinpoint their geographic location - ie the party's busted.  ""If you want to completely disconnect and raise your children in that world you've got to go to the jungles of the Amazon or something; in the world we live in today this pervasive ubiquitous technology is only going to expand,"" he says, adding that he doesn't want his sons raised in a bubble, but he can't ignore reality.  ""This technology could save lives so I think that it's absolutely a great thing to be able to track our kids.""

That proportion rose to two-thirds among medium and large companies. Most often, these breaches involved fraudulent emails being sent to staff or security issues relating to viruses, spyware or malware. The survey was completed by 1,500 UK businesses and included 30 in-depth interviews. The government said a ""sizeable proportion"" of the businesses still did not have ""basic protections"" in place. While many had enacted rudimentary technical controls, only one-third had a formal policy covering cybersecurity risks. Less than a third (29%) had assigned a specific board member to be responsible for cybersecurity. 'Box-ticking exercises' Businesses' susceptibility to cyber-attacks was a known issue, noted Prof Andrew Martin at the University of Oxford. ""A lot of businesses have responded to the problem with a box-ticking exercise or by paying an expensive consultant to make them feel better - it's far from clear that what people are doing is protecting them very well,"" he told the BBC. He added it remained difficult for most people to distinguish malicious emails or websites from safe ones. ""It's all very well to say don't open emails from an unknown source - but most of us couldn't do business if [we] didn't do that,"" he added. The government's survey indicates, however, that fewer businesses in 2017 consider cybersecurity to be of ""very low priority"". It said 74% now agreed it was a high priority issue for senior management. 'Alarming' rise in ransomware tracked Could hackers turn the lights out?

Phishing is a form of cyber-attack in which emails with malicious links or attachments are disguised as genuine.

spyware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-40286280|Company directors targeted by identity fraudsters By Kevin Peachey Personal finance reporter Published 15 June 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Company directors are the victims of one in five cases of identity fraud, according to fraud prevention organisation Cifas. They account for 19% of victims of these type of fraud cases, despite making up less than 9% of the UK population. Directors have been targeted directly by scams owing to the potential for con-artists to steal large sums. Fraud victims are most likely to be aged between 31 and 50, Cifas said. However, the biggest rise in 2016 from the previous year was among those aged 21 and under. The report, by Cifas and LexisNexis Risk Solutions, also warned that fraudsters were attempting to obtain credit files as a pre-cursor to committing identity fraud.  Some 47% of recorded identity frauds involving fraudulently obtained credit files from company directors took place in London and the South East of England. In comparison, Wales and the North East of England each accounted for 2% of these fraud cases.     Social engineering The vast majority of identity fraud takes place when a fraudster pretends to be an individual, so as to buy a product or take out a loan in their name.  Fraudsters get hold of the necessary personal material by stealing mail, computer hacking, obtaining data on the dark web, and exploiting personal information on social media, according to Cifas. They can also gather it though social engineering, where people give up personal information to someone pretending to be from their bank, the police or a retailer.  Cifas advises people to shred important paper documents - and use passwords, privacy settings and anti-virus software on their computers. How to protect yourself from identity crimes Limit the amount of personal information you give away on social networking sites. Your real friends know where you live and know your birthday Update your computer's firewall, anti-virus and anti-spyware programmes. Up to 80% of cyber threats can be removed by doing this Never share passwords or PINs (personal identification numbers) with others and do not write them down Use strong passwords and PINs - don't use your date of birth or your child's name, include a mix of upper and lower case letters, numbers and punctuation marks. Aim for a minimum of 10 characters in a password Do not use the same password or PIN for more than one account Shred all your financial documents before you throw them away Source: Cifas Related Topics Personal finance Fraud More on this story Three words to set alarm bells off for every firm Published 31 March 2017 The 'bogus boss' email scam costing firms millions Published 8 January 2016 Identity fraud at record levels in 2016 Published 15 March 2017

Listing the personal details of more than 3,000 individuals from the far western region of Xinjiang, it sets out in intricate detail the most intimate aspects of their daily lives. The painstaking records - made up of 137 pages of columns and rows - include how often people pray, how they dress, whom they contact and how their family members behave. China denies any wrongdoing, saying it is combating terrorism and religious extremism. The document is said to have come, at considerable personal risk, from  the same source inside Xinjiang that leaked a batch of highly sensitive material published last year . One of the world's leading experts on China's policies in Xinjiang, Dr Adrian Zenz, a senior fellow at the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation in Washington, believes the latest leak is genuine. ""This remarkable document presents the strongest evidence I've seen to date that Beijing is actively persecuting and punishing normal practices of traditional religious beliefs,"" he says. One of the camps mentioned in it, the ""Number Four Training Centre"" has been identified by Dr Zenz as among those visited by the BBC as part of a tour organised by the Chinese authorities in May last year. media caption The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" Much of the evidence uncovered by the BBC team appears to be corroborated by the new document, redacted for publication to protect the privacy of those included in it. It contains details of the investigations into 311 main individuals, listing their backgrounds, religious habits, and relationships with many hundreds of relatives, neighbours and friends. Verdicts written in a final column decide whether those already in internment should remain or be released, and whether some of those previously released need to return. 'I spent seven days of hell in Chinese camps' The leading Uighur geographer who vanished in China It is evidence that appears to directly contradict China's claim that the camps are merely schools. In an article analysing and verifying the document,  Dr Zenz argues that it also offers a far deeper understanding  of the real purpose of the system. It allows a glimpse inside the minds of those making the decisions, he says, laying bare the ""ideological and administrative micromechanics"" of the camps. Row 598 contains the case of a 38-year-old woman with the first name Helchem, sent to a re-education camp for one main reason: she was known to have worn a veil some years ago. It is just one of a number of cases of arbitrary, retrospective punishment. Others were interned simply for applying for a passport - proof that even the intention to travel abroad is now seen as a sign of radicalisation in Xinjiang. In row 66, a 34-year-old man with the first name Memettohti was interned for precisely this reason, despite being described as posing ""no practical risk"". And then there's the 28-year-old man Nurmemet in row 239, put into re-education for ""clicking on a web-link and unintentionally landing on a foreign website"". Again, his case notes describe no other issues with his behaviour. The 311 main individuals listed are all from Karakax County, close to the city of Hotan in southern Xinjiang, an area where more than 90% of the population is Uighur. Predominantly Muslim, the Uighurs are closer in appearance, language and culture to the peoples of Central Asia than to China's majority ethnicity, the Han Chinese. In recent decades the influx of millions of Han settlers into Xinjiang has led to rising ethnic tensions and a growing sense of economic exclusion among Uighurs. Those grievances have sometimes found expression in sporadic outbreaks of violence, fuelling a cycle of increasingly harsh security responses from Beijing.  It is for this reason that the Uighurs have become the target - along with Xinjiang's other Muslim minorities, like the Kazakhs and Kyrgyz - of the campaign of internment. The ""Karakax List"", as Dr Zenz calls the document, encapsulates the way the Chinese state now views almost any expression of religious belief as a signal of disloyalty. To root out that perceived disloyalty, he says, the state has had to find ways to penetrate deep into Uighur homes and hearts. In early 2017, when the internment campaign began in earnest, groups of loyal Communist Party workers, known as ""village-based work teams"", began to rake through Uighur society with a massive dragnet. With each member assigned a number of households, they visited, befriended and took detailed notes about the ""religious atmosphere"" in the homes; for example, how many Korans they had or whether religious rites were observed. The Karakax List appears to be the most substantial evidence of the way this detailed information gathering has been used to sweep people into the camps. It reveals, for example, how China has used the concept of ""guilt by association"" to incriminate and detain whole extended family networks in Xinjiang. For every main individual, the 11th column of the spreadsheet is used to record their family relationships and their social circle. China's hidden camps The long read: China's hidden camps Explainer: China's Muslim 'crackdown' Searching for truth in China's 're-education' camps China denies Muslim children separation campaign Alongside each relative or friend listed is a note of their own background; how often they pray, whether they've been interned, whether they've been abroad. In fact, the title of the document makes clear that the main individuals listed all have a relative currently living overseas - a category long seen as a key indicator of potential disloyalty, leading to almost certain internment. Rows 179, 315 and 345 contain a series of assessments for a 65-year-old man, Yusup. His record shows two daughters who ""wore veils and burkas in 2014 and 2015"", a son with Islamic political leanings and a family that displays ""obvious anti-Han sentiment"". His verdict is ""continued training"" - one of a number of examples of someone interned not just for their own actions and beliefs, but for those of their family. The information collected by the village teams is also fed into Xinjiang's big data system, called the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP). The IJOP contains the region's surveillance and policing records, culled from a vast network of cameras and the intrusive mobile spyware every citizen is forced to download. The IJOP, Dr Zenz suggests, can in turn use its AI brain to cross-reference these layers of data and send ""push notifications"" to the village teams to investigate a particular individual. image caption Adrian Zenz has analysed the leaked document The man found ""unintentionally landing on a foreign website"" may well have been interned thanks to the IJOP. In many cases though, there is little need for advanced technology, with the vast and vague catch-all term ""untrustworthy"" appearing multiple times in the document. It is listed as the sole reason for the internment of a total of 88 individuals. The concept, Dr Zenz argues, is proof that the system is designed not for those who have committed a crime, but for an entire demographic viewed as potentially suspicious.  China  says Xinjiang has policies that ""respect and ensure people's freedom of religious belief"". It also insists that what it calls a ""vocational training programme in Xinjiang"" is ""for the purposes of combating terrorism and religious extremism"", adding only people who have been convicted of crimes involving terrorism or religious extremism are being ""educated"" in these centres. However, many of the cases in the Karakax List give multiple reasons for internment; various combinations of religion, passport, family, contacts overseas or simply being untrustworthy. The most frequently listed is for violating China's strict family planning laws. In the eyes of the Chinese authorities it seems, having too many children is the clearest sign that Uighurs put their loyalty to culture and tradition above obedience to the secular state. China has long defended its actions in Xinjiang as part of an urgent response to the threat of extremism and terrorism. The Karakax List does contain some references to those kinds of crimes, with at least six entries for preparing, practicing or instigating terrorism and two cases of watching illegal videos. But the broader focus of those compiling the document appears to be faith itself, with more than 100 entries describing the ""religious atmosphere"" at home. The Karakax List has no stamps or other authenticating marks so, at face value, it is difficult to verify. It is thought to have been passed out of Xinjiang sometime before late June last year, along with a number of other sensitive papers. They ended up in the hands of an anonymous Uighur exile who passed all of them on, except for this one document. Only after the first batch was published last year was the Karakax List then forwarded to his conduit, another Uighur living in Amsterdam, Asiye Abdulaheb. She told the BBC that she is certain it is genuine. image caption Asiye Abdulaheb decided to speak out, despite the danger ""Regardless of whether there are official stamps on the document or not, this is information about real, live people,"" she says. ""It is private information about people that wouldn't be made public. So there is no way for the Chinese government to claim it is fake."" Like all Uighurs living overseas, Ms Abdulaheb lost contact with her family in Xinjiang when the internment campaign began, and she's been unable to contact them since. But she says she had no choice but to release the document, passing it to a group of international media organisations, including the BBC. ""Of course I am worried about the safety of my relatives and friends,"" she says. ""But if everyone keeps silent because they want to protect themselves and their families, then we will never prevent these crimes being committed."" At the end of last year China announced that  everyone in its ""vocational training centres"" had now ""graduated"" . However, it also suggested some may stay open for new students on the basis of their ""free will"". Almost 90% of the 311 main individuals in the Karakax List are shown as having already been released or as being due for release on completion of a full year in the camps. But Dr Zenz points out that the re-education camps are just one part of a bigger system of internment, much of which remains hidden from the outside world. image caption The outside of one of the camps in Xinjiang More than two dozen individuals are listed as ""recommended"" for release into ""industrial park employment"" - career ""advice"" that they may have little choice but to obey. There are well documented concerns that China is now building a system of coerced labour as the next phase of its plan to align Uighur life with its own vision of a modern society.  In two cases, the re-education ends in the detainees being sent to ""strike hard detention"", a reminder that the formal prison system has been cranked into overdrive in recent years. Many of the family relationships listed in the document show long prison terms for parents or siblings, sometimes for entirely normal religious observances and practices. One man's father is shown to have been sentenced to five years for ""having a double-coloured thick beard and organising a religious studies group"". A neighbour is reported to have been given 15 years for ""online contact with people overseas"", and another man's younger brother given 10 years for ""storing treasonable pictures on his phone"". Whether or not China has closed its re-education camps in Xinjiang, Dr Zenz says the Karakax List tells us something important about the psychology of a system that prevails. ""It reveals the witch-hunt-like mindset that has been and continues to dominate social life in the region,"" he said.

Most of the men flew into Istanbul on two private jets  hours before Mr Khashoggi arrived at the consulate to collect some routine paperwork, and flew back to Riyadh later in the day on the same jets.  Turkish officials believe the men are Saudi officials and intelligence officers, an allegation that appears to be supported by open source information that is freely available. Saudi authorities deny any involvement in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. They insist he left the consulate soon after getting the paperwork. Salah Muhammed A Tubaigy, 47 image copyright AFP Dr Tubaigy is a forensic pathologist who completed a master's degree at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, and  in 2015 he spent three months at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Australia .  The doctor identifies himself on his Twitter account as a professor of forensic medicine  and head of the Saudi Scientific Council of Forensics. The account also links to the Saudi interior ministry.  In 2014 the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq al-Awsat said  Dr Tubaigy was a lieutenant colonel  working for the forensic science department of the interior ministry's General Directorate of Public Security.   media caption Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death In an interview, accompanied by a photograph of him wearing uniform, the doctor discussed a mobile laboratory that he had designed to allow pathologists to perform post-mortems in only seven minutes in order to quickly determine the cause of death of Muslims performing the Hajj pilgrimage.  Turkish officials have also said that Dr Tubaigy was carrying a bone saw  when  he flew into Istanbul Ataturk Airport  from Riyadh at 03:13 on 2 October on a private jet with the tail number HZSK2. The jet is owned by Sky Prime Aviation Services, a company that was reportedly seized by the Saudi government in an anti-corruption drive last year. Dr Tubaigy stayed at a MÃ¶venpick Hotel Istanbul, 0.5km (0.3 miles) west of the Saudi consulate, and departed Istanbul airport on HZSK2 at 22:54 on 2 October. The jet returned to Riyadh via Dubai, landing late on 3 October. Unnamed Turkish officials have since alleged that Dr Tubaigy can be heard in audio recordings  from inside the consulate on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, when they believe the journalist was tortured, killed and dismembered by the Saudi team who flew into the country.  A man identified as the doctor can be heard  recommending that other people join him in listening to music on headphones while he cuts up Mr Khashoggi's body, according to the officials. Dr Tubaigy has not commented.  But a man who said he was the doctor's uncle tweeted that he would never carry out ""such criminal acts"" . Maher Abdulaziz M Mutreb, 47 image copyright AFP Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London.  A document published by the British government in 2007  listed a man with that name as first secretary.  A surveillance source confirmed to the BBC his identity as ""an intelligence security operative"", having met him in 2011 and trained him in how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state. The spyware trainers nicknamed Mr Mutreb ""dark face"", the source said, ""because he looked always grumpy... he was very silent."" Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training CNN cited a Saudi source in London  who knew Mr Mutreb as describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers -  lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court .   image copyright Getty Images image caption A man identified as Maher Mutreb can be seen in the far right of a photo from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March Photographs also show  that he has travelled abroad with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman on at least three occasions since March 2018, suggesting he may have had a security role.  The Turkish pro-government  newspaper Sabah also published pictures  from CCTV footage that appeared to show Mr Mutreb entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul at 09:55 on 2 October, just over three hours before the journalist arrived, and at the nearby consul-general's residence at 16:53. Turkish media said Mr Mutreb arrived in Istanbul on the private jet HZSK2 along with Dr Tubaigy, and also stayed at the MÃ¶venpick hotel.  He flew out of Istanbul on another private jet owned by Sky Prime Aviation with the tail number HZSK1, at 18:40 on 2 October, according to Turkish media.

Experts at computer security company Kaspersky Lab warned that the Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) site had been compromised. It is believed the malicious software could be used to spy on visitors. Technical evidence suggests the hackers carried out previous cyber-attacks on human rights groups in Asia. Tibet.net is the official website of the CTA, which is based in Dharamshala, northern India. The organisation's spiritual leader is the 14th Dalai Lama, who fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed anti-Chinese uprising, and set up a government-in-exile. China considers the Dalai Lama a separatist threat. Constant threat Kaspersky says the CTA website has been under constant attack from the same group of hackers since 2011, but previous breaches have been quietly identified and repaired before attracting significant attention. Other Tibetan organisations, such as the International Campaign for Tibet, have also been targeted. Kaspersky Lab researcher Kurt Baumgartner says the hackers used a method known as a ""watering-hole attack"". A security bug in Oracle's Java software might have been exploited, giving hackers a ""back door"" into browsers' computers.  ""This is the initial foothold,"" Mr Baumgartner said. ""From there they can download arbitrary files and execute them on the system.""  Kaspersky's education manager Ram Herkanaidu said the discovery of the attack came after an ""email account of a prominent Tibetan activist was hacked"". Mr Herkanaidu added: ""The likely actors behind the sustained campaign against Tibetan sites are Chinese speaking, as in many cases we have seen log files written in Chinese.""

Most of the attacks involved viruses, spyware or malware, the Cyber Security Breaches Survey says. A quarter of large firms experiencing a cyber breach did so at least once a month. Digital Economy Minister Ed Vaizey said it was ""absolutely crucial businesses are secure and can protect data"". In some cases the internet-linked attacks cost millions of pounds. The survey's results have been released alongside the government's Cyber Governance Health Check, launched following the TalkTalk cyber attack in October last year. The phone and broadband provider, which has over four million UK customers, said some of their banking details and personal information could have been accessed in the breach. In light of these surveys, businesses are now being urged to protect themselves better. Government investment Mr Vaizey said: ""The UK is a world-leading digital economy and this government has made cyber security a top priority. ""Too many firms are losing money, data and consumer confidence with the vast number of cyber attacks. It's absolutely crucial businesses are secure and can protect data."" The survey also suggested seven out of 10 attacks could have been prevented, and added that only a fifth of businesses understand the dangers of sharing information with third parties. The government is investing Â£1.9bn over the next five years to tackle and prevent cyber crime, and a new National Cyber Security Centre will offer security support. Also, a national cyber security strategy will be published later this year, setting out proposals to improve online security for the government, among businesses and for consumers.

In a Washington State lawsuit, Indian firm iYogi is accused of using scare tactics to mislead consumers. It is also accused of falsely claiming affiliation to Microsoft, Apple and HP. The firm has denied the allegations, describing them as ""false"" and ""baseless"". ""While we are yet to receive the complaint through formal channels, based on our assessment of media reports we would like to firmly state that the allegations are false or baseless,"" said iYogi's co-founder Vishal Dhar in a statement to the BBC. ""We recognise that tech support frauds are a real issue in the US and, as a responsible industry leader, we have been working with authorities... to counter the issue."" He said that his firm would ""do what is necessary"" to see the case through ""to its rightful end"". Attorney General Bob Ferguson alleged that ""hundreds, if not thousands"" of Washington residents had been affected by what he described as iYogi's ""unfair and deceptive"" tactics, which he claimed violated Washington's consumer protection and computer spyware laws. He is seeking $2,000 (Â£1,340) in civil penalties for each violation of the Consumer Protection Act and $100,000 per violation for the Computer Spyware Act. Microsoft's chief legal officer Brad Smith attended a news conference announcing the lawsuit and applauded the state for its efforts to ""protect consumers from tech support scams that have reached epidemic levels in recent years"". He said that his firm had received more than 180,000 customer calls regarding tech support fraud.

Such scams tended to disproportionately affect ""the most vulnerable segments of our society"", he said, adding that tech support scams ""have become a scourge on the internet"". iYogi has more than 5,000 employees based at call centres in India. It says it serves more than three million customers across 11 countries. As part of its investigation the Attorney General's Office (AGO) alleged that iYogi used the following tactics: In online ads it associated itself with major technology companies including Microsoft, Apple and HP, claiming to provide tech support services on their behalf It gained remote access to consumers' computers and identified complex-looking files, which it claimed were infected and could cause harm. It then encouraged consumers to download its diagnostic software to identify further computer problems It created reports that claim that there is malware or other serious defects when in fact the identified items were often routine programs that posed no threat It offered unnecessary tech support plans that could cost about $140 per year It attempted to sell consumers anti-virus software even if they already had some installed It offered to update PCs to the Windows 10 operating system, which it sold for $80, even though Microsoft offers the upgrade for free The AGO also offered advice to avoid tech support scams: Never give control of your computer to a third party unless you can confirm it is legitimate Ask if there is a fee or subscription association with the service, and if there is, hang up Do not provide social security numbers, banking, credit card or other financial information Protect personal computers with legitimate and updated security software iYogi was earlier this year praised by US politicians when it set up a global centre in Maine, employing 300 people.

John Ison said he gave updates about Nikki Sinclaire at least once a week to Mr Farage ""to protect the party"". Her defence claims he spied on her to ingratiate himself with UKIP leaders. Ms Sinclaire, who denies misconduct in public office between 1 October 2009 and 31 July 2010, while a serving MEP, is on trial at Birmingham Crown Court. She also denies claims that between 14 October 2009 and 31 December 2010 she fraudulently transferred criminal property into her bank account. 'Captured' data The court heard from barrister Sean Hammond, representing Ms Sinclaire, that there was a ""background of hostility"" between his client and Mr Farage. The defence said Mr Ison was treated by Ms Sinclaire as a ""confidant"" when she was trying to gain entry to the party's national executive committee in 2010, shortly after having lost the party whip. However, the court was told Mr Ison worked to ""undermine"" her, then sought to exploit confusion over the European expenses system as a back-up tactic. Mr Ison denied the claims. The defence also presented a text from Mr Ison to party colleague Steve Morson from January 2010 claiming to have ""captured"" data from Ms Sinclaire's laptop, alleging he had hacked her computer and installed spyware to gain information. During proceedings Mr Ison admitted sending the message to Mr Morson, but used his right not to incriminate himself by declining to answer whether he had breached the Computer Misuse Act, When asked by Mr Hammond if he was behaving like ""a spy or a mole"", Mr Ison replied: ""If you want to put it that way."" He admitted the message ""looked very bad"" but denied wrongdoing. Ms Sinclaire, 47, of Shirley in Solihull, was West Midlands MEP until 2014.

The FBI says Carlos Enrique Perez-Melara ran a website offering customers a way to ""catch a cheating lover"" by sending spyware masquerading as a greeting card. Opening the card downloaded the malware on to the recipient's computer and recorded keystrokes and messages. The ""Lover Spy"" program cost $89 (Â£55). Mr Perez-Melara was indicted in July 2005 but has avoided capture ever since, only now making it on to the FBI's most wanted list. He ran the operation from his San Diego home in 2003, the FBI says, while he was in the US on a student travel visa. The charges against Mr Perez-Melara, 33, included making, sending and advertising an interception device, and unlawfully intercepting electronic communications. The indictment said Lover Spy was designed ""with stealth in mind, claiming that it would be impossible to detect by 99.9% of users"".  But Mr Perez-Melara has avoided the authorities ever since and his last known location was San Salvador, the FBI said. The agency appears to have added the hacker to its list partly out of frustration at his elusiveness.  ""These are sophisticated folks who know how to hide themselves on the internet,'' said John Brown, who oversees the FBI's cyber-division. The agency has offered a $50,000 reward for information leading to his arrest.  According to the 2005 indictment, Mr Perez-Melara sold the malware to 1,000 customers, who then used it to infect the computers of about 2,000 victims.  Victims took the bait about half the time, the government said.  People who bought the spyware were charged with illegally intercepting electronic communications.

The images show the hand the player has been dealt as well as their player ID. This, said Eset, allows the attacker to search the sites for that player and join their game. Using information about a victim's hand gives the attacker a significant advantage. ""We are unsure whether the perpetrator plays the games manually or in some automated way,"" wrote Mr Lipovsky. Eset found the Windows malware lurking in some well-known file-sharing applications, PC utilities as well as several widely used poker calculators and player databases. Eset said the spyware had been active for several months and most victims were in Eastern Europe, particularly Russia and the Ukraine.

spyware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37192670|"Who are the hackers who cracked the iPhone? Dave Lee North America technology reporter Published 26 August 2016 comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption The NSO Group boasted about being able to work without ""a trace"" What do we know about the curious, secretive NSO Group? Very little - but after this week, an awful lot more than we did before. The group, an Israeli-based but American-owned company, specialises in creating what it calls tools against crime and terrorism. But the security researchers call them something else: a cyber arms dealer. On Thursday, the NSO Group was thrust into international headlines after being credited with creating malicious software capable of ""jailbreaking"" any iPhone with just one tap of the screen, and then installing vicious spyware. Factfile: NSO Founded in 2010 and has had several different names Based in Herzliya, Israel, and owned by US investment firm Francisco Partners Could be worth $1bn Security-savvy human rights lawyer Ahmed Mansoor found himself targeted by the attack when his iPhone received a message promising ""secrets"" about torture happening in prisons in the United Arab Emirates.  Had he tapped on the link, the phone would have been plundered. Huge amounts of private data: text messages, photos, emails, location data, even whatâs being picked up by the deviceâs microphone and camera. Thankfully, he didn't do that. Instead, he passed on the message to experts at Citizen Lab and Lookout, who peeled back the covers on what they described as one of the most sophisticated cyber weapons ever discovered. With it came evidence that it was the NSO Groupâs expertise at the heart of it all. Big money deals Earlier this year, UK-based watchdog Privacy International launched a database tracking the global trade of cyber arms. Its intention was to track deals between cyber arms companies and governments. According to the Surveillance Industry Index (SII), the NSO Group was founded in 2010 and is based in Herzliya, an attractive city north of Tel Aviv that is known as being a cluster of tech start-ups. The group was likely funded by the elite 8200 Intelligence Unit, an Israeli military-funded scheme for start-ups.  According to Forbes, the  8200 Intelligence Unit was heavily involved  in providing expertise and funding for  Stuxnet , a cyber attack on Iran that was a joint operation between the US and Israel.  image copyright AP image caption The texts had been sent to human rights activist Ahmed Mansoor Listed in the SSI were multi-million dollar deals made between the NSO Group and government entities in Mexico and Panama. This is the tip of the iceberg - âpress reports of sales rely on leaks and anonymous sources, and so there are likely many more unknown to the general public.  In 2015, the NSO Groupâs owners - âUS-based venture capital firm Francisco Partnersâ - were looking to sell the company at a value of around $1bn. Neither firm has responded to the BBCâs requests for further comment. That the NSO Group sells tools to governments is no secretâ - âin a statement released in response to claims it was behind the attack on Mr Mansoor, NSO Group spokesman Zamir Dahbash said: ""The company sells only to authorized governmental agencies, and fully complies with strict export control laws and regulations."" But the company has gone no further than that in describing who its customers are, and what exactly they buy. It does say it has no control over how its tools are used and for what purpose. Outstanding work Whatever the origin of the NSO Group, what has been created is an extraordinarily talented team of cyber specialists. The attack on Mr Mansoor, had it worked, would have utilised not one but three zero day attacks. A ""zero day"" is a term given to vulnerabilities that were previously unknown to the security industry, and are therefore wide open to attack. To discover one zero day is rare, to find three is outstanding. Clues to the origin of the attack came when the experts looked at the messages Mr Mansoor received. A link was included to a web domain known to point to servers set up by the NSO Group for its customers. When the researchers analysed the spywareâs code, they noticed apparent references to ""Pegasus"", the name given, by the NSO Group, to one of its spying products. Details about Pegasus were made public last year when another cyber arms firm, called the Hacking Team, was itself breached. Material used to market Pegasus was subsequently leaked.  When Apple was made aware of the vulnerabilities in its iPhone, it acted quickly, patching the problem in 10 days and pushing out an update to all of its users. That has neutralised this specific attack, sure, but there'll likely be many more that remain hidden from view.  In a rare interview with Defense News, the NSO Groupâs co-founder, Omri Lavie, said their attacks would ""leave no trace"".  Thanks to the quick thinking of Mr Mansoor, and the forensic efforts of researchers, the group has been temporarily dragged into the limelight - but it will only be for a brief moment. Soon the NSO Group  will rejoin the rest of the money-spinning cyber arms trade back in the shadows.

Last year, the Syrian Electronic Army  rose to prominence  when they hacked into news websites and Twitter accounts run by the BBC, CBS, and other high profile media organisations. Now the group appears to be using ""social engineering tricks"" - offering content that typically goes viral on social media - to install spyware on computers belonging to those who oppose the Assad regime. And they appear to be working. Internet security firm Kaspersky estimates the malicious software has been downloaded around 10,000 times. One of the tricks involves promoting videos claiming to be of victims injured in recent attacks by the Assad regime. When attempting to download the clips from file sharing sites, rogue software is downloaded as well, which could give hackers access to the computer. If successful, they can record keystrokes, obtain passwords, and record online phone calls. Another piece of bait used is a letter which purports to be between Syrian military units detailing forthcoming chemical attacks. image copyright Photograph used in a Kaspersky report Other methods include posting messages on Facebook encouraging users to protect themselves from government attacks by installing ""Ammazon Internet Security"" software - a fake anti-virus programme designed to compromise the user's machine. David Emm works for Kaspersky Lab, an internet security firm that  produced a report  about the attacks.  ""It's social engineering. It's aimed at people who would be shocked or angered by what's been posted,"" he tells BBC Trending. Although it is impossible to be certain they are the work of the Syrian Electronic Army, there are clues that suggest they are involved. As well as the nature of the content itself, the spyware is passing information back to a server with an IP address provided by the TARASSUL, as ISP associated with the Syrian government. Once infiltrated, the machines can be used to collect intelligence, and disrupt opposition networks. Emm says the attacks are likely to become both more prolific and more sophisticated as the conflict continues. Social networks have played a huge role in the Syrian conflict to date. Government regulated news broadcasts have pushed many people online in a search for more information. Social media has been used for everything from breaking news, to documenting battles, and fundraising for opposition forces. Reporting by  Sam Judah Have you subscribed the BBC Trending podcast?

His death comes as a scandal over phone-hacking gathers pace.  The man left a suicide note admitting that he had deleted important information about the hacking. It has emerged that mobile phones were tracked and monitored just before the presidential election in 2012. Government and NIS officials have denied opposition claims that the spyware - bought from an Italian company - was used to monitor South Koreans in general. image copyright AP image caption The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a retrial in the case of former NIS head Won Sei-hoon, who was convicted for trying to influence the results of the 2012 presidential election They insist that its purpose was to boost the country's cyber-warfare capabilities against North Korea.  The BBC's Stephen Evans, in South Korea, says that the note left by the dead man implies that phones were monitored only to keep tabs on people connected to North Korea and not to besmirch opponents of the right-of-centre president. The spy agency had a scandalous reputation in the years before South Korea embraced democracy in the 1980s, and was involved in abductions and killings. The modern NIS is not accused of such serious offences but has nevertheless been embroiled in several scandals, including election meddling. Opposition politicians allege that it is not politically neutral, breaks the law and is a political tool for sitting presidents. Last week the Supreme Court ordered a review of the conviction of former NIS head Won Sei-hoon, who was sentenced to three years in jail in February for trying to influence the results of the 2012 presidential election.

A rift has opened up between Tories and former friends in business. Business lobbies are calling ever more forcefully for Westminster to sort out Brexit while avoiding a 'no deal' departure. The report card on the May premiership has some changes to economic policy, but her fall opens the way for a bigger change, on the Conservative approach to immigration. When a corporate chief executive quits, it's sometimes worth a look at the share price. A sharp rise suggests that the boss was holding back the company, and an exit was overdue: a fall indicates that investors saw the boss's presence as an important part of its future. So how did the market react to Theresa May's announcement? By doing nothing much. The pound weakened 0.25% against the US dollar. The FTSE250 edged up.   That is partly because investors had already priced in her departure. They could see she wasn't going to cut a deal that got the government through Brexit, so assumed she would be resigning before long. And with her gone, they can also see - as we all can - that there's little alternative route out of the political impasse under any other Conservative prime minister. Meanwhile, there are other factors at play in the markets which give a better explanation of recent fluctuations, including the ramping up of a trans-Pacific trade war between the US and China. Treated as dispensable Just ahead of the announcement, the latest retail figures were issued by the Office for National Statistics, showing  the volume of goods sold up by 5.2% year on year . The value was flat, after a very strong first quarter. Add to that an  unemployment rate at a 44-year low , and employment at record levels, and you can see the economic record while Theresa May was in Downing Street wasn't so bad at all. If she had focused on that, there might have been a less tearful conclusion to her time in office. But the economy was never, personally, her main interest or strong point. It was a factor within the overarching determination to push through Brexit, but it was treated as if it were dispensable or an after-thought. For some, it could be compromised in the endeavour to placate those who saw the return of sovereignty as being of more value than the diminished growth rate which most economists reckon would follow. image copyright Getty Images image caption The prime minister visited the Portmeiron factory in Stoke-on-Trent in January In the turmoil within her cabinet, it was left to the minority of ministers with economic portfolios to remind colleagues of the potential damage to businesses and the economy. Phillip Hammond, as chancellor of the exchequer, and Greg Clark as business secretary, often cut lonely figures in making that case. Under May's leadership, a gulf opened up between the Conservatives and big business, which has been causing alarm to both sides of that relationship. Business lobbies have become increasingly frustrated that the internal Conservative debate about Brexit has been carried on with little reference to their warnings, which have been particularly strong about the potential damage of ""no deal"". When the CBI director-general visited Edinburgh recently, for a lunch with members, the guest speaker was due to be Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell. He didn't make it to the Scottish capital due to the (doomed) Brexit talks with the government. But the invitation was a sign that the business lobby is turning its attention (with quite a lot of alarm) to the prospect of Jeremy Corbyn and Labour taking power. 'Nothing has changed' The common message to all those reacting to the Therexit of Mrs May is that it doesn't change the arithmetic or provide a solution. Indeed, it prolongs the uncertainty, and introduces the risk of a harder-line Brexiteer pushing for departure without a deal. The Institute of Directors, with a gently mocking tone, repeats the prime minister's words when she had a botched double launch of her long term care policy during that disastrous election campaign in 2017. ""Nothing has changed,"" says the IoD boss. ""At least not much. A new leader will be faced with the same political challenges and the same economic realities. No deal remains a significant and growing concern for businesses and that cannot be wished away, whoever is in power. ""When companies and the country need serious, considered decision-making, we have pantomime instead."" According to Carolyn Fairbairn, director-general of the CBI, Theresa May ""leaves office with the respect of business"".  ""But her resignation must be now be a catalyst for change,"" she added. ""There can be no plan for Britain without a plan for Brexit.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Theresa May addressed the CBI conference in London in November ""Winner takes all politics is not working. Jobs and livelihoods are at stake. Business and the country need honesty. Nation must be put ahead of party, prosperity ahead of politics. Compromise and consensus must re-find their voice in Parliament"". A similar message came from Liz Cameron at the Scottish Chambers of Commerce: ""We now urge political leaders to put country before personal ambitions, to ensure focus remains on solving the Brexit riddle.  ""Westminster has already squandered far too much time going around in circles. They must realise that lack of direction has real-world economic consequences, causing the collapse of business confidence, which has a deleterious impact on investments and jobs."" Trade war Some changes to economic policy under Theresa May's premiership are worth noting. She pulled back on George Osborne's focus on the Northern Powerhouse in the north of England. An industrial policy was being developed.   The government dolloped money into growth sectors where it saw strategic interest. But this was submerged by the battle to protect sectors, such as car-making and steel, that are particularly vulnerable to Brexit disruption. And in recent weeks, the need to open trade out beyond the European Union tripped up over the Pacific trade war.  image copyright Getty Images image caption A visit to the Jaguar Land Rover factory in Solihull with Chancellor Philip Hammond in 2016 The Downing Street cabinet was split between welcoming Chinese telecoms technology (the prime minister's preference), and supporting the American case that Huawei carries too much potential as spyware. Being a much smaller trading power than the EU, and with trade deals to be done, expect more similar dilemmas. As chancellor, Phillip Hammond dialled back on the austerity rhetoric, and pushed back his predecessor's target date for reaching a surplus.  While the Whitehall welfare budget continued to see big cuts, the biggest of them through the freeze on working-age benefits, the flow of funds to the National Health Service was increased. Windrush fiasco And what of the future? Apart from the dominant question of Brexit, and how to make it happen, the next Conservative leader will have the opportunity to re-shuffle the cabinet, putting different people into the economic ministries, and shifting economic policy. My hunch is that there won't be enormous change, because there isn't the time, government headspace or political capital to do much beyond Brexit. But one factor to watch is immigration. Theresa May has had a stranglehold on immigration policy for nine years since she became home secretary. It was on that that she placed her reputation for toughness. She gave us the policy of making a ""hostile environment"" for those facing deportation, meanwhile blundering into the Windrush fiasco, of excluding long-time residents of the UK who had been invited 60 years ago from the Caribbean to fill labour market gaps. image copyright Getty Images image caption Mrs May's cabinet included potential leadership contenders Jeremy Hunt, Philip Hammond and Sajid Javid Mrs May shut out new thinking about how to handle immigration. Behind the Leave majority, it played a significant part. Even for the six years before that vote, her response to public opinion about it was to set an unrealistic target for reducing net migration to below 100,000 and then to stick to it, while deaf to unintended consequences - for instance, on overseas student recruitment. The rest of the cabinet has sometimes been infuriated by Mrs May's intransigence on this when she was home secretary. Now in that role, Sajid Javid doesn't much care for the sub-100,000 target. In launching a consultation on post-Brexit immigration, he quietly dropped it. That consultation features the question of what salary level should be set for an EU or non-EU national to get a work permit in Britain. The proposed level is Â£30,000, which business groups say is far too high to recruit the skilled staff they need in more junior roles. The next Tory leader and prime minister is likely to want to take a more flexible approach than Theresa May. In Scotland, such a change would be welcomed across Holyrood's political spectrum, and by business lobbies. Related Topics Theresa May Scotland economy Brexit"
spyware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-50809562|"Tech 2019: Our biggest technology stories By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor Published 31 December 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing As 2019 splutters to a close, it's time for our annual lookback at our most-read tech stories, and to ask: ""What happened next?"". Facebook and its family of apps dominates this year's list with four entries - it  probably won't be a surprise that none of them were particularly brand-enhancing.  The Chinese viral video app TikTok makes the cut for the first time. And many of the other ""big tech"" names are there too in one form or another. But there are a few notable exceptions. Neither Elon Musk nor Tesla made it, despite the  window-smashing launch of the Cybertruck  and  plans to hack our brains.  Google's co-founders were originally on the list  after deciding to give up day-to-day control of their empire , but were squeezed out just before publication. Video gaming also missed out, even though Prince Harry attracted lots of attention for  suggesting Fortnite should be banned. And both Huawei and Samsung are absent, even though  the former's loss of Google's apps  and the latter's  folding phone fiasco  were two of the year's standout developments. In any case, here's what attracted most eyeballs in each month of the year: January: When three becomes one image copyright Getty Images A leak forced Facebook to reveal plans to merge the behind-the-scenes tech of messaging on WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram. The effort was reported to be a pet project of chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.  He later justified the move saying it  would draw the three products closer together,  making it easier for users to send posts between them. Furthermore, he said it would also help the firm expand its end-to-end encryption features, which help keep the messages secure.  Many observers noted, however, the action would also make it more difficult to split the company apart. And as the year went on that became a growing threat, with first Senator Elizabeth Warren and then other Democratic presidential candidates suggesting Facebook has too much power and influence. But it may not take a change of administration for Mr Zuckerberg's ambitions to be thwarted. The Wall Street Journal recently  reported that the Federal Trade Commission may intervene  to prevent the apps being integrated. February: Don't be scared Social media, the mainstream news and even the police all got in a tizzy over Momo for no good reason in February. It was claimed that youngsters' social media accounts were being ""hacked"" to show the bulging-eyed monster alongside ""challenges"" that would put their lives at risk.  Online articles followed, linking more than 100 teenagers' deaths in Russia to the sensation. Except, of course, there was no evidence to back up any of this.  This was not even the first time an image of the Japanese bird-woman sculpture had gone viral. There had been a similar smaller-scale scare in 2018 when the ""game"" had been linked to deaths in South America and India - again without any documented proof.  Pundits described it as a  ""panic [that] won't go away"" . Except it did.  These days a search for Momo on Twitter turns up ads for masks of the ghoul, but little else.  And on TikTok the hashtag #momochallenge surfaces videos of people cooking and eating small dumplings that go by the same name in parts of Asia. March: Turn it off and on again image copyright Getty Images Facebook's family of apps experienced 14 hours of disruption, in what was billed as their ""most severe outage"" to date.  In many cases, users were unable to access the services at all over the period. And it took the firm about another 10 hours to give itself the all-clear,  at which point it tweeted  that a ""server configuration change"" had been to blame.  That allowed it to deny suggestions that it had been hacked, while remaining suitably vague about the actual cause. April: How did they get in? image copyright Getty Images Cyber-security experts despaired after a study indicated that the most popular online password was ""123456"".  The UK's National Cyber Security Centre's finding came with a warning that the string of digits is not only easy to guess, but would be one of the first codes tested by automated hacking tools.  The public is advised to instead register a  different complex login for each service they join , and use a password manager. But the hassle involved in having to copy and paste them in each time, has encouraged the adoption of biometric tests that automate the process if users pass a face, eyes or fingerprint ID check. Another alternative is to log in via another platform and let it do the heavy lifting. And in September, Apple joined the party when it allowed users to  access third-party apps via a new Sign In With Apple button , mirroring earlier efforts by Google, Facebook and Twitter. May: WhatsApp cracked image copyright Getty Images When WhatsApp confirmed that a vulnerability in its app had been exploited to install surveillance software on victims' phones, one of the immediate questions was how widespread the attack had been.  It took until October to get some clarification, at which point Facebook said it believed  about 1,400 of its users had been directly compromised . It added that they included ""at least 100 human rights defenders, journalists and other members of civil society"" across at least 20 countries.  The tech firm alleges NSO Group, an Israeli private security firm, is responsible and is currently suing it in the US courts. NSO disputes the claim and has said it will ""vigorously fight"" the case.  Whatever the outcome, the affair highlighted that if an attacker can load spyware onto a target's phone or other device, end-to-end encryption and other security measures may be in vain. June: The death of Etika image copyright Etika/YouTube Brooklyn-based Desmond ""Etika"" Amofah had a large online following, thanks to his quick wit and Nintendo video-game reaction videos on YouTube and Twitch. But in mid-June he caused concern when he posted a clip in which he discussed suicide. Days later the New York City Police Department confirmed he had killed himself.  Several of his friends and colleagues have since taken steps to memorialise him. An online store sells goods branded with his logo, and donates its profits to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. YouTuber PewDiePie also teamed up with actor Jack Black to raise further funds for the charity in Etika's name.  Others have marked the tragedy by  getting themed tattoos . A still active Twitter account -  @Etika  - was created to keep his memory alive. And last month, a large mural was unveiled in Brooklyn featuring the gamer's face alongside a pair of Nintendo Switch controllers.

July: Photo glitches image copyright Getty Images Further technical problems at Facebook HQ prevented users being able to upload new photos and videos to its apps, and in some cases prevented existing ones being viewable. The disruption lasted for about nine hours.  Facebook never really explained the cause, beyond saying it had been triggered by a maintenance operation. Other smaller glitches persisted throughout the year, including intermittent outages in the US on Thanksgiving. But given that it now  serves more than 2.4 billion users  who log into at least one of its services once a month, it is a considerable feat of engineering to keep everything ticking along. August: iPhone booby traps image copyright Getty Images Studies indicate that Apple's mobile devices  face fewer serious cyber-security threats  than Android-powered equivalents. So when Google revealed that hackers were using booby-trapped websites to exploit previously unidentified flaws in iOS, potentially affecting ""thousands of visitors per week"", it was big news.  Google  added that compromised handsets  made it possible for the perpetrators to steal private messages, photos and location data in real-time. For days there was speculation about who might have been exposed. Apple  eventually released a statement  saying it believed that fewer than a dozen websites focused on ""content related to the Uighur community"" had been affected. Many took this to suggest that the Chinese state was involved. However, Apple did not explicitly draw this conclusion itself, which was unsurprising given its ties to the country. This was not Apple's only Uighur-related controversy this year. The campaign group Sum of Us has repeatedly claimed  that the firm's willingness to comply with a Chinese ban on  virtual private network (VPN) apps has made it harder for civil rights defenders to safely discuss claims of abuses against the ethnic minority. The organisation now plans to raise the matter at Apple's next annual shareholders' meeting.  September: More cameras media caption WATCH: Taking a slowfie with the iPhone 11 The iPhone 11 range got more cameras, longer-lasting batteries and a new ""pro"" moniker for the top-of-the-range models. But there was no 5G - despite Samsung, Huawei and other rivals having already launched compatible smartphones. And whispers that Apple chief executive Tim Cook might be ready to unveil an augmented reality headset accessory, proved to be unfounded.  Market watchers have since  reported the iPhones sold better than they expected  - particularly in the US and Western Europe. And there is now talk of 2020 being the year of an ""iPhone supercycle"" thanks to an expected revamped design along with the introduction of 5G. October: Jedi wars image copyright Getty Images/Reuters Amazon - and many outsiders - thought it had the strongest bid for a high-profile contract to provide the Pentagon with cloud computing and artificial intelligence services. So there were shockwaves when Satya Nadella's Microsoft clinched the so-called Jedi deal instead. It could be worth as much as $10bn (Â£7.7bn) over time. Not only was this a big sum to miss out on, but Microsoft's marketing team should also find it easier to pitch the firm's Azure services to other government departments and private companies as a consequence. This could put Amazon Web Services' current status as the market leader under strain. Amazon is challenging the award, claiming that President Trump pressured the Department of Defense into rejecting its bid because of a personal vendetta against its chief executive Jeff Bezos. All of this could all have ramifications for the 2020 presidential election. Regulation of big tech is already on the agenda, and Amazon could make a tempting target for Mr Trump during the campaign. But if Mr Bezos believes the Republican leader's re-election could threaten his business, his status as one of the world's richest men and the owner of the Washington Post could make him a formidable foe. November: The eyes have it media caption WATCH: Feroza Aziz rejects TikTok's explanations for blocking her from its app At the start of the year, TikTok was fairly obscure beyond its core teenage audience. These days it is one of the most talked about apps. It has launched one meme after another, and earned a reputation as being one of the most joyous places to be on the internet. But there are also concerns about it being Chinese-owned. Matters came to a head last month when an American teenager posted a video that started off like an eyelash beauty tutorial. But creator Feroza Aziz quickly changed tack to criticise China's treatment of the Uighurs. Her clip went viral. Shortly afterwards, the 17-year-old discovered she had been blocked from posting new material. And soon after that, TikTok took the clip offline. Then the social network reversed course. It put back the clip, blaming the removal on a ""human moderation error"". And it re-established Ms Aziz's access, saying that she had been locked out because of unrelated past behaviour.  The app  insisted that there had been no attempt to suppress criticism of the Chinese government's actions , but Ms Aziz was not convinced. She has continued to flag concern about the Uighurs. And in her latest ""skin care"" video also raises awareness about India's controversial citizenship law, which offers illegal immigrants from nearby countries amnesty but only if they are non-Muslims - something she claims is ""immoral"". For whatever reason, the post has attracted far more views on Twitter and Instagram than the copy posted to TikTok. Meanwhile, TikTok bosses are  reportedly looking for a new global headquarters outside of China  to help reinforce their claims to autonomy. But the app's owner Bytedance has  denied rumours that it might sell off the division  to give it true independence. December: Age of the Splinternet? image copyright Sasha Mordovets It's been a long while since the internet was a free-for-all, in which governments had little ability to restrict what their citizens did online. Even so, Russia's announcement that it had successfully tested what it terms a ""sovereign internet"" still felt like a significant moment. The initiative involves forcing all web traffic through special nodes - a term for network connection points - where content can be filtered to remove what is deemed to be risky material. Furthermore, the intention is that in an ""emergency"" all data from outside the country could be blocked and the Runet - a term for the Russian internet - isolated. The achievement is described in the state media as a way to protect domestic companies and government bodies from cyber-attacks. But human rights campaigners warn that once the effort is up and running, the Kremlin may also use it to limit Russian people's access to ""undesirable"" information. In doing so, the Russian government would be following the path of its counterparts in China, Saudi Arabia and Iran, which all censor dissenting voices.  And it would be following a wider trend. The  US-based Freedom House digital rights group  has warned that global internet freedom declined for a ninth consecutive year in 2019. Beyond Russia, it highlighted Kazakhstan, Sudan and Brazil as examples of places where digital surveillance, targeted cyber-attacks and/or online disinformation campaigns were cause for concern. We should hear more about Russia's effort once President Putin has had a chance to examine the results of the tests, and decides how to proceed.

Links and sites related to Kate Moss, David Beckham, Daniel Radcliffe, Kerry Katona, Amy Winehouse, Cheryl Cole and Leona Lewis made up the rest of the top 10. Websites can be compromised by being loaded with spyware that collects information about users without their knowledge, and viruses that can infiltrate computers. Computer protection firm McAfee looked at popular search engines like Google and Yahoo! and weighed up the risk of clicking on celebrity-related website links. Security analyst Greg Day said: ""Cybercrooks capitalising on the public obsession with celebrities and current events is nothing new.

Experian identified the group, which only made up 8% of the population, as suffering the biggest rise in ID theft. There was a 17% rise in victims among this group compared with 2014. The analysis comes shortly after fraud prevention service Cifas said Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn had become a  ""hunting ground"" for identity thieves . Experian said those on social media should be cautious about the information they shared, especially if details such as their pets' names were used as passwords elsewhere on the web. Personal details ""It is vital that those embracing technology also embrace protecting themselves online.  Using the latest device doesn't necessarily mean full protection and being complacent about the risk of ID theft makes for a tempting target for ID fraudsters,"" said Nick Mothershaw, a fraud expert from Experian. The next biggest rise in identity theft was among older and retired households, predominantly living in rural communities. ""These people are being targeted through phone and email scams by fraudsters trying to steal their details,"" said Mr Mothershaw.  ""They tend to be less aware of the types of scams fraudsters undertake, who can be very manipulative and sound trustworthy on the phone. The sole rule is to never give out personal details, passwords or Pins to anyone, whether it is on the phone or by email.""

The malware may have been designed by a state-sponsored group. It can disguise itself as benign files and does not operate in predictable ways, making it harder to detect. Experts from Kaspersky Lab and Symantec said it allows the attacker to spy on infected computers. In September last year, Kaspersky first detected the malware on an unspecified ""government organisation"" network. Since then, the firm claims to have found evidence of Project Sauron at more than 30 organisations in Russia, Iran and Rwanda. These were generally government, scientific, military, telecoms and financial organisations, according to Kaspersky. Separately, Symantec said it had found the malware in other countries, including at an airline in China and an embassy in Belgium. Hidden threat Project Sauron is able to disguise itself in a wide variety of ways - as files with names similar to those published by organisations like Microsoft, for example, and does not always use the same methods for sending data back to the attacker. ""The attackers clearly understand that we as researchers are always looking for patterns,"" the company notes  in its report . ""Remove the patterns and the operation will be harder to discover."" The malware can steal files, log all keystrokes and open a ""back door"" allowing wide-ranging access to the compromised computer,  according to Symantec . Project Sauron did not share any code with other known examples of similarly powerful malware, said Kaspersky's director of threat research Costin Raiu. ""It really stands out by itself as something very, very sophisticated,"" he told the BBC. image copyright Kaspersky Lab image caption Project Sauron may have been created by a state-sponsored hacker group, researchers believe Mr Raiu also pointed out that two of the malware's victims had been infected with other highly sophisticated malicious programs. One victim was found to have Regin spyware on their systems, for example. ""This would suggest that the actor behind Project Sauron is perhaps different,"" suggested Mr Raiu. USB attack One aspect of Project Sauron that demonstrates the malware's sophistication is its ability to steal sensitive data - such as encryption keys - from computers that are not actually connected to the internet. This is known as ""jumping the air-gap"". For this, Project Sauron relies on an infected USB drive being inserted into the target computer. A hidden cache of files on the drive is then able to deposit malware on to that PC. image copyright Thinkstock image caption Project Sauron may have been used to steal confidential files at more than 30 organisations, claims Kaspersky Lab It is not yet clear how the attackers would have used this method to control an air-gapped computer, but they believe it might have been via a ""zero day"" - previously undetected - exploit that they have not yet found. ""We believe it was probably deployed in rare, hard-to-catch instances,"" notes the Kaspersky report. Project Sauron is characteristic of state-sponsored style malware, according to cybersecurity expert Graham Cluley. ""These are very stealthy, insidious attacks that can lurk in the background for years gathering information,"" he told the BBC. ""We have seen the steady progression and evolution of these sorts of attacks. As governments try to protect themselves and get clued up, it is essentially an arms race.""

The police in Toronto gave no further information about the deaths. Ashley Madison's Canadian parent company Avid Life Media is offering a C$500,000 (Â£240,000) reward for information on the hackers, they added. Details of more than 33m accounts were stolen from the website, which offers users the chance to have an affair. Addressing the hackers, known as The Impact Team, acting staff superintendent Bryce Evans of the Toronto police said: ""I want to make it very clear to you your actions are illegal and we will not be tolerating them. This is your wake-up call."" Police are seeking information from members of the wider hacker community that might aid their investigation. The breach was ""very sophisticated"", said Detective Menard from the technological crime unit of Toronto Police. Cash reward Mr Evans confirmed that credit card data was included in the original data dump released by The Impact Team. He said that investigators believed this was limited to the last four digits of the main card number.  Consequently, police are advising victims of the hack to review their accounts. He also explained that the hack had already led to a series of ""spin-offs of crimes and further victimisation"". ""Criminals have already engaged in online scams by claiming to provide access to the leaked websites,"" he said.  ""The public needs to be aware that by clicking on these links you are exposing your computers to malware, spyware, adware and viruses."" 'Thunderstruck' The unfolding of the hack was also detailed at the conference - from the moment on 12 July when several Avid Life Media employees logged in to their computers and were confronted by a message from the hackers. This message was accompanied by music - AC/DC's ""Thunderstruck"", said Mr Evans. ""This hack is one of the largest data breaches in the world and is very unique on its own in that it exposed tens of millions of people's personal information,"" he added. Police have set up  a Twitter account, @AMCaseTPS , and hashtag, #AMCaseTPS, in a bid to gather information about the hack from members of the public. In a statement, Avid Life Media confirmed the offer of a financial reward for information and it believed the investigation was proceeding positively. ""We are confident that the considerable investigative and prosecutorial power that is being brought to bear on this unprecedented crime will lead to arrests and convictions,"" the firm said.

The data, taken from 261 companies in the UK, suggests fraudsters are increasingly getting people's personal information from social media sites. Cifas said Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn had become a ""hunting ground"" for identity thieves.  It said there were more than 148,000 victims in the UK in 2015 compared with 94,500 in 2014. A small percentage of cases involved fictitious identities but most fraudsters assumed the identity of a real person after accessing their name, date of birth, address and bank details. More than 85% of the frauds were carried out online. Some personal details were found by hacking computers but increasingly fraudsters used social media to put together the pieces of someone's identity, Cifas said.  It urged people to check their privacy settings and think carefully about what information they share online. How do you avoid being scammed? Unmasking the fraudsters The curious case of Leah Palmer The  Get Safe Online  campaign warns people not to give away details such as phone numbers, addresses or date of birth, or pictures of their home, workplace or school, in either profile information or posts. Often victims did not even realise they had been targeted until a bill arrived for something they did not buy or they experienced problems with their credit rating, the fraud prevention service added.

One of mine almost was thanks to Minecraft. One of my boys wanted to install a mod for it and needed me to approve it. And as I am paranoid about what runs on our main computer, I oversaw the whole process. At first, it all looked fine.  There are thousands of mods or add-ons for Minecraft that make a variety of changes to the game. Some add new blocks, others change the way it looks and some turn it into an entirely different game.  The one he wanted was hard to find, despite it being popular among his friends. When we found it, I was not sure we were getting it from the person who actually created it. I was suspicious because the site was festooned with buttons that looked like they would start the download but instead led to dead ends populated by links to download accelerators and other utilities we did not want. Grubby ads blinked alongside. I'm not sure mature Russian women are keen to meet my 12-year-old son. Cybersecurity Alert special index Is your phone listening to you? How to hack the average home Hanging out with the script kiddies Ukraine blackout hacks 'could happen elsewhere' image copyright Capcom image caption Scams aimed at young web users and fans of popular games, such as Neopets, have a long history After a few dead ends, we clicked the right link but then had to wait while we were put through several re-directs and a pop-up page that could not be shut down if we wanted the mod.  We did, so we stuck with it and the download started. And kept going. And going. Which was odd given it was only a few megabytes in size. My suspicions aroused, I killed the download over my son's protests. It was just as well. Running it through an online malware scanner revealed that though it was not actively malicious it would have installed adware and hijacked searches. Definitely not the mod we wanted. Big target Soon afterwards, I found a warning about the page saying it was fake. That warning was circulated by  the Stop Mod Reposts campaign . It is attempting to stop popular mods being hijacked by conmen, virus writers and cyber-thieves.  It maintains a long, long list of the scam pages offering re-packaged mods. It even makes an extension for web browsers that warns when you stray on to a dodgy site. ""Minecraft is a huge target,"" said Chris Boyd, a security researcher at Malwarebytes and a veteran scam-spotter. He has seen fake sites offering the game for free, fake pages asking visitors to log in with their Minecraft name and password as well as a variety of other scams offering skins, capes and cheats. But, he said, there was a long history of cyber-conmen going after children and the things they do online. He remembers seeing scams in 1999 that targeted the economy around Neopets - digital creatures popular with younger web users.  Staying safe online Keep all software up-to-date and patched. Use anti-virus and anti-spyware software. And a firewall. Give your children an account on a PC or laptop that restricts what they can install.  Use strong passwords (mix letters, numbers and symbols) and do not share them. Not even with friends. Be wary of links offered in chat forums or in-game. Talk to your children about what is appropriate behaviour.  Choose neutral user names. Use different login details on different sites. Do not reveal personal information, even to those who are being friendly. Be sceptical of flashy ads and links to games, cheats, and freebies that offer in-game currencies. Check if there is a way to restrict who children play with online. Check online privacy settings to see with whom data is being shared. Younger gamers are regularly targeted, said Mark James of security firm Eset and many inadvertently give away their age with the names they choose when they sign up to a site or service. Scammers and conmen can lurk in forums offering advice and links to extras, cheats and advice pages that are actually laced with malware.  ""Often in-game chat channels play host to predators waiting for that click on a 'bad' link that infects a device,"" he said. There is evidence that lurking on a gaming service pays off for the bad guys. Valve, which runs the massively popular Steam gaming service, revealed late last year that 77,000 accounts for the service are being hijacked each month. Control of those accounts will be lost via Steam's chat system or through booby-trapped links. image copyright Thinkstock image caption A flashy advert can entice a child to click where they shouldn't Mr James warned against befriending people on social media just to get ""freebies"" for games and said parents needed to educate children about safe browsing and gaming and what information was appropriate to share. Without this, he said, children can be an easy target. ""If they want that mod or add-on they will do almost anything to get it,"" he said. ""Unfortunately many young people do not have the perspective to see what long-term damage could be done if they are caught out."" Statistics from security firm Symantec suggest that younger people are getting hit regularly. A report it produced in early 2016 revealed that a quarter of parents have had a child or know someone with a child whose actions compromised the family's online security. Jacqueline Beauchere, Microsoft's chief online safety officer, said scammers go to great lengths to catch children out. ""Young people are easily enticed to click flashy advertisements, visit unofficial websites of popular celebrities, download so-called 'free' games, and tap 'Agree', 'OK', or 'I accept' to quickly get to where and what they want to online,"" she said. ""Many of these actions are just notorious pathways to viruses, spyware and other malicious software."" The scammers went after children, said Ms Beauchere, because of the cache of valuable loot that one mistake might lead them to. image copyright Thinkstock image caption Pick passwords that are hard to guess and do not share them around or re-use them. ""Among criminals, personal and financial data about any and all individuals has become the sought-after 'currency' of the web,"" she said. Cyber-thieves targeted children only to get at this data, she said.  Mr Boyd from Malwarebtyes agreed. And, he said, what helped the scammers was the way children typically get online.  ""A lot of kids play via their parents tablets, laptops and desktops,"" he said. ""It's quite likely that parents will re-use login details on other accounts. And there's likely to be a payment method attached to it."" That is the data they are after, he said. What makes this tougher to police, he said, is that children often know more than their parents about the technology. That competence can fool many parents into thinking their offspring are safer online than they actually are.  ""I would be surprised if parents know much about how the technology works,"" he said. But, he added, staying safe is not impossible. It takes collaboration between parents and children. Both need to educate the other about what they do and how to stay safe.

Also on the podcast this week: is Bitcoin really using more energy than Ireland? And what kind of qualities do you need to succeed as a professional e-sports player? We try to answer those questions on this week's Tech Tent. Apple: the root of the problem For a long time, Apple has boasted - with some justification - that it has an excellent record of keeping its devices safe from intruders.  In any case, with PCs having the lion's share of the computer market, hackers and security researchers used to spend little time hunting down vulnerabilities in Macs. But on Tuesday a Turkish software developer tweeted this: ""Dear @AppleSupport, we noticed a *HUGE* security issue at MacOS High Sierra. Anyone can login as 'root' with empty password after clicking on login button several times."" It sounded unlikely but it was true. What it meant was that anyone who got hold of an Apple computer running the latest operating system could get root access to the machine with very little trouble. image copyright Getty Images image caption Apple's Tim Cook ""Root access is a bit like having a master key to the building,"" Prof Angela Sasse, from University College London, tells Tech Tent. ""It's really bad news.""  She explains that it means an intruder could install new software, such as spyware, on your computer. And she is surprised that this issue was not spotted before High Sierra was released. ""Normally before release you would test that root access is adequately protected."" Apple moved quickly to release an update to patch this loophole in the operating system's defences. So will it suffer any long-term consequences in terms of a loss of consumer trust? Neil Mawston, from the tech consultancy Strategy Analytics, says Apple is a very clever company with a great brand.  But he has some concerns: ""We're seeing this gradual tick-tock of mis-steps in delivery.""  Recently, we have seen the delay in the launch of Apple's Homepod - and another, albeit much more minor, security issue.  ""If products are late or they have lots of flaws and that keeps on building up momentum, then that negative press coverage eventually catches up with them."" A decade ago a furious Steve Jobs would have roamed the Cupertino campus to find someone to eject from the building for such a serious error. Tim Cook's style is very much more measured, but do not be surprised if there is some movement in the upper ranks of Mac management in the coming months. Bitcoin's energy conundrum It has been a dizzying week for anyone who takes an interest in the crypto-currency Bitcoin. It started 2017 worth just under $1,000 (Â£740) but this week it soared past the $10,000 mark. In the days that followed, the volatility we have come to expect from the Bitcoin market has become even more pronounced. In the space of three hours, its price dropped by more than $2,000, only to bounce back a few hours later. The debate over whether this is a speculative bubble or the future of money gets hotter by the moment. But so too do concerns over the amount of energy used in the process of mining Bitcoin and recording transactions. As banks of computers whir away, many of them in China, the electricity consumed as they solve increasingly complex mathematical problems gets ever greater. According to one study, Bitcoin is now using more energy each year than the whole of Ireland, and will soon surpass Morocco's energy use. This does not sound sustainable, but as long as the value of Bitcoin keeps rising, miners will not care about the electricity bills. And meanwhile the incentive to plant software on websites to hijack visitors' computers to help mine Bitcoin will only increase. Playing for high stakes Competitive video gaming or e-sports is a rapidly growing business. Market research firm Newzoo thinks this young industry will make nearly $700m in revenue this year. And it is not all about consoles - mobile gaming is increasingly popular. This weekend, London hosts the Clash Royale Crown World Championships, a global tournament entered by more than 27 million players, according to Supercell, the Finnish creators of the mobile game Clash Royale. image caption The Rum Ham and ElecTr1fy Only a few of those will be professional e-sports players. This new breed can earn substantial sums, not only from tournaments but from sponsors, advertisers and from fans who watch them streaming their practice sessions on Twitch or YouTube and just send them money. So what does it take to make it as one of these new sports stars?  We hear from ElecTr1fy - yes, it is important to have an arresting name - who tells us his YouTube channel has added 40,000 subscribers and had generated 40 million views over the last month.  ""You need fast instincts  - every delay can cost you the game,"" he tells us. ""And you need to get into your opponent's head."" That message is reinforced by The Rum Ham, a gamescaster - another new profession - providing live commentary on e-sports. He says it is about making good decisions quickly.  ""They're making decisions where hundreds of thousands of dollars are on the line in a split second.  These players are doing mental maths, spatial awareness, predicting the outcomes of a combat before the troops are even on the field - all in a three-minute game play."" And the prize? Well the best players are making more than a million dollars a year. Time to put away the crossword, forget about the Sudoku and get down to some serious gaming.

spyware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39268542|"Identity fraud reached record levels in 2016 Published 15 March 2017 comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images Young people are a growing target for identity theft cases, which have reached record levels in 2016, fraud prevention organisation Cifas says.  Almost 25,000 victims of fraud were aged under 30, with the number of under-21s defrauded rising by a third. The statistics, from 277 banks and businesses, show almost 173,000 recorded frauds in 2016 - the highest level since records began 13 years ago.  Cifas says people must be more vigilant about protecting their personal data. The 172,919 incidents of identity fraud last year represents 53.3% of all fraud recorded by Cifas, of which 88% occurred online.    The number of under-21s being defrauded rose from 1,343 in 2015 to 1,803 in 2016. Cifas deputy chief executive Mike Haley said better education around fraud and financial crime was needed.  ""With nine out of 10 identity frauds committed online and with all age groups at risk, we are urging everyone to make it more difficult for fraudsters to abuse their identity.  ""We all remember to protect our possessions through locking our house or flat or car but we don't take the same care to protect our most important asset - our identities."" City of London Police Commander Chris Greany, who is national co-ordinator for economic crime, said: ""With close to half of all crime now either fraud or cyber crime we all need to make sure we protect our identity. ""Identity fraud is the key to unlocking your valuables. Things like weak passwords or not updating your software are the same as leaving a window or door unlocked."" Luke Croydon: 'It's a very troubling experience' In the last five years, both Luke Croydon and his partner have been victims of identity theft.  He says many people in the building they live in have been victims, because letterboxes are out on the street so bills are more easily stolen.  The thief then signs up to various credit accounts, and steals the cards when they are delivered.  The first you learn about it is when you see a statement with a sum of money in your name left in your letterbox, he explains. He goes on to describe what he calls ""a very troubling experience"" and says: ""You wonder what else they have done with that personal detail.""  If it's only bank accounts, that's one thing but you worry they might have signed up to websites or applied for a passport, he says. It's a mixture of anger for the person who has defrauded you, and fear for whether the bank in question is going to try and call in that debt that you didn't build up, he adds. According to Cifas, the vast majority of identity fraud takes place when a fraudster pretends to be an individual, so as to buy a product or take out a loan in their name.  Fraudsters get hold of the necessary personal material by stealing mail, computer hacking, obtaining data on the dark web, and exploiting personal information on social media. They can also gather it though social engineering, where people give up personal information to someone pretending to be from their bank, the police or a retailer.  Cifas advises people to shred important paper documents - and use passwords, privacy settings and anti-virus software on their computers. How to protect yourself from identity crimes Limit the amount of personal information you give away on social networking sites.

spyware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39219637|"The weird names the CIA gives its hacking tools Published 9 March 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images Thousands of documents said to detail the CIA's hacking tools were published by Wikileaks on Tuesday, and many were given peculiar names by their makers. Here are five of the strangest. Weeping Angel One of the hacking tools that featured in a lot of headlines was the Weeping Angel that appears to get a Samsung Smart TV to record conversations. It's named after a character in the sci-fi TV series Doctor Who, which appears as still as a statue. The name could have been chosen ""because you think it is not alive but it is, you think it isn't doing anything but it is"" says Alan Woodward, a security researcher who advises Europol and previously advised UK spy agency GCHQ. The leaks suggest  the TV appears to turn itself off and, likewise, the weeping angel can appear to be frozen and come to life when you are not looking. While the UK's MI5 agency is said to have helped build this spyware, it's possible CIA hackers from the US are also Doctor Who fans.  Another hacking tool, which attempts to listen to calls on systems such as Skype, is named after the Sontarans.  These characters look like potatoes and try to conquer the earth by emitting poisoned gas.  Ricky Bobby image copyright AP The tool Ricky Bobby can control a computer remotely without detection using commands in Microsoft Windows,  according to the leak . But it is named after a far more conspicuous character. Racing car driver Ricky Bobby was played by Will Ferrell in the 2006 film Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. After crashing in a race, he runs round the track wearing only his helmet and underwear insisting he is on fire.  He also manages to get his best friend, Cal, to become a car racer. This is not lost on the makers of Ricky Bobby the hacking tool.  When they made a listening post for RickyBobby, they called it Cal. Starving Weasel  image copyright AP One of the leaks suggests hackers love naming their spy tools so much that they come up with names before they've made the tool. Starving Weasel is from a  long list of names for future tools  chosen ""because they are awesome"". ""These are mostly oblique references to things I like, TV tropes names that amuse me and situations or phrases at work encoded in toolname-esque obscurity,"" says the person whose name has been replaced with User #77010.  Oblique is an understatement. Starving Weasel is a reference to a lyric from mid-way through an 11-minute song by Weird Al Yankovic. In the song Albuquerque, Weird Al goes to the doughnuts shop only to be told there are no doughnuts left but there is a ""box of one dozen starving, crazed weasels"". He buys the weasels and they jump out of their box and start eating his face, at which point he meets the woman of his dreams. Maddening Whispers image copyright Getty Images This is where the CIA hackers may reveal themselves in their geekiest form, because Maddening Whispers is a reference to the online role-playing game World of Warcraft. ""It's almost too stereotypical - it's really painting a picture of a hacker who likes pizza, beer, science fiction and online gaming,"" says Mr Woodward. The game sees players exploring a vast landscape full of monsters, completing quests and interacting with other gamers. Maddening Whispers is a spell in the game, which, when you deploy it, slowly weakens your opponent.  As for the tool, it tries to get remote access to a device named Vanguard. Mr Woodward is unsure what this refers to but suggests it could be Vanguard alarm systems.  Niche on both counts. Snowy Owl  image copyright Hawk Conservancy Trust Some hacking tools are named after slightly more obvious signs of aggression: birds of prey.  Bald eagle ,  harpy eagle  and  sparrowhawk  all feature. A bird of prey can swoop on its victim almost silently.  Similarly, the sparrowhawk tool can detect the letters you are hitting on a keyboard without you having any idea you are being watched. Then there is the less threatening snowy owl, which is  described in the leaks as  a tool designed to remotely operate a Mac computer.  There is a possibility it was not named after the bird at all but instead was inspired by the Brownies.  In a Brownie troop the Snowy Owl is an adult who helps the leader of the troop, the Brown Owl. ""Maybe we have our first indication that there is a woman involved,"" speculates Mr Woodward.

But the cyber attack has been successfully rebuffed and prevented from spreading, Iranian media report. Iran's nuclear enrichment efforts were hit hard in 2010 by the Stuxnet worm, which was also blamed for problems at industrial plants and factories. Tehran accused Israel and the US of planting the malware. Provincial civil defence chief Ali Akbar Akhavan said Iranian industry was constantly being targeted by ""enemy cyber attacks"" and companies in Hormozgan province had recently been infiltrated, the semi-official Isna news agency reported. ""The Bandar Abbas electricity supply company has come under cyber attack,"" he told a news conference. ""But we were able to prevent its expansion owing to our timely measures and the co-operation of skilled hackers."" The Bandar Abbas plant, on Iran's southern coast in the Strait of Hormuz, is said to supply power to neighbouring provinces as well as Hormozgan. Spyware Iran has regularly claimed success in defeating computer viruses, such as Stuxnet and Flame, which have affected its industries. In April, a malware attack on Iran's oil ministry and national oil company forced the government to disconnect key oil facilities, including the Kharg Island oil terminal that handles most of Tehran's exports. Late last year, Iran said some of its computer systems were infected by the Duqu spyware which was believed to have been designed to steal data to help launch further cyber attacks. The attacks have affected its energy exports as well as its controversial uranium enrichment programme, which Western countries suspect is aimed at constructing nuclear weapons. Tehran insists it is solely for peaceful purposes. The biggest cyber attack so far was from the Stuxnet worm, believed to be the first known virus specifically targeted at infrastructure such as power stations. In 2010, Iran accused the West of trying to disrupt its nuclear facilities with the Stuxnet worm. Researchers estimated that five industrial processing organisations in Iran were hit repeatedly between June 2009 and April 2010 by the worm which they believed had been created by a ""nation state"" in the West. Iran said centrifuges used in uranium enrichment had been sabotaged and the UN nuclear watchdog said the enrichment programme had been temporarily brought to a halt. Reports suggested that the worm had infected the personal computers of staff at Iran's first nuclear power station at Bushehr. In September this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the United Nations General Assembly that time was running out to stop Tehran having enough enriched uranium to build a nuclear bomb. US President Barack Obama has said the US will do ""what we must"" to stop Iran acquiring nuclear weapons.

Under a new bill, investigators would be able to hack into computers, install spyware, read emails and destroy files.  They could also break into servers located abroad, if they were being used to block services.   Critics say the proposed measures are unnecessary and could set a dangerous precedent for people living under oppressive governments. Use of the powers would be subject to the approval of a judge, the government stresses.  The bill would also make it a crime for a suspect to refuse to decipher encrypted files during a police investigation. It is expected the draft legislation will be put to parliament by the end of the year. The bill singles out child pornography and terrorism as two areas of special concern. The publication of stolen data would also become punishable. Justice Minister Ivo Opstelten is also keen to put an end to so-called DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) web-attacks, that flood intended targets such as banks with large amounts of traffic, making them unreachable. . Simone Halink of digital rights group Bits of Freedom said the law would set a bad precedent and had been ""rushed"".

NSA internal memos obtained by Le Monde detailed the use of a sophisticated surveillance programme, known as Genie. US spies allegedly hacked foreign networks, introducing the spyware into the software, routers and firewalls of millions of machines. It comes a day after claims the NSA tapped millions of phones in France. The details in the latest Le Monde article are based on leaks from ex-intelligence analyst Edward Snowden, through Glen Greenwald, the outgoing Guardian journalist, who is feeding the material from Brazil, says the BBC's Christian Fraser in Paris. It comes on the day the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, is in London meeting foreign counterparts to discuss Syria. 'Spy implants' The Le Monde report sets out details of Genie, an NSA surveillance programme in which spyware implants were introduced remotely to overseas computers, including foreign embassies.  It claims bugs were introduced to the French Embassy in Washington (under a code name ""Wabash"") and to the computers of the French delegation at the UN, codenamed ""Blackfoot"". The article suggests that in 2011, the US allocated $652m (Â£402m) in funding for the programme, which was spent on ""spy implants"".  Tens of millions of computers were reported to have been hacked that year. A document dated August 2010 suggests intelligence stolen from foreign embassy computers ensured the US knew ahead of time the positions of other Security Council members, before a UN vote for a resolution imposing new sanctions on Iran.   The US was worried the French were drifting to the Brazilian side - who were opposed to implementing sanctions - when in truth they were always aligned to the US position, says our correspondent. The intelligence agency quotes Susan Rice, then-US ambassador to the UN, who praises the work done by the NSA: ""It helped me know... the truth, and reveal other [countries'] positions on sanctions, allowing us to keep one step ahead in the negotiations."" On Monday, Le Monde alleged that the NSA spied on 70.3 million phone calls in France between 10 December 2012 and 8 January 2013. At a breakfast meeting with the US secretary of state on Tuesday, French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius demanded a full explanation.   Referring to a telephone call between the French and US presidents, Mr Fabius told reporters: ""I said again to John Kerry what Francois Hollande told Barack Obama, that this kind of spying conducted on a large scale by the Americans on its allies is something that is unacceptable."" Asked if France was considering reprisals against the US, government spokeswoman Najat Vallaud-Belkacem replied: ""It is up to Foreign Minister Fabius to decide what line we take but I don't think there is any need for an escalation. ""We have to have a respectful relationship between partners, between allies. Our confidence in that has been hit but it is after all a very close, individual relationship that we have."" Both French officials made their comments before the latest revelations appeared in Le Monde. Mr Snowden, a former NSA worker, went public with revelations about US spying operations in June. The information he leaked led to claims of systematic spying by the NSA and CIA on a global scale. Targets included rivals like China and Russia, as well as allies like the EU and Brazil. The NSA was also forced to admit it had captured email and phone data from millions of Americans. Mr Snowden is currently in Russia, where he was granted a year-long visa after making an asylum application. The US wants him extradited to face trial on criminal charges."

ID fraudsters obtain personal information before pretending to be that individual and apply for loans or store cards in their name. A total of 89,000 cases were recorded in the first six months of the year by UK anti-fraud organisation Cifas. That is a 5% rise on the same period last year and a new record high. ""We have seen identity fraud attempts increase year on year, now reaching epidemic levels, with identities being stolen at a rate of almost 500 a day,"" said Simon Dukes, chief executive of Cifas. ""These frauds are taking place almost exclusively online. The vast amounts of personal data that is available either online or through data breaches is only making it easier for the fraudster."" The curious case of Leah Palmer Unmasking the fraudsters ID theft accounts for more than half of fraud recorded by Cifas, a not-for-profit organisation that shares fraud prevention tips between businesses and public bodies. More than four in five of these crimes were committed online, it said, with many victims unaware that they had been targeted until they received a random bill or realised their credit rating had slumped. This would prevent them getting a loan of their own. Fraudsters steal identities by gathering information such as their name and address, date of birth and bank account details. They get hold of such information by stealing mail, hacking computers, trawling social media, tricking people into giving details or buying data through the ""dark web"". Analysis: Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent I got a worrying insight into how our online activity can leave us open to identity theft when a security company offered to examine my digital footprint.  Its 30-page report showed that a lot of personal details that might be useful to a criminal were out there on public websites - but if you choose to have an online presence, that is quite hard to avoid.   Far more worrying was the presence in hidden corners of the web of some of my passwords for various accounts, harvested in some of the many hacking attacks on major online firms.  Luckily I had already changed those passwords, but the security researchers told me that anyone in the Western world who used the internet reasonably often was likely to have their details held in one of these data dumps. That information is up for sale on a number of criminal marketplaces.  Identity theft is big business and it is thriving on the dark web.  media caption ID theft at ""epdemic levels"" Victims are more likely to be in their 30s and 40s, often because a good deal of information about them has been gathered online. The stereotypical image of a fraud victim is someone who is elderly and vulnerable, but the over-60s are the only age group that has seen cases fall this year compared with the first half of the year, according to Cifas. The age group which has seen the biggest rise is 21 to 30-year-olds. This finding was mirrored in separate research by credit checking company Experian. It said that since 2014, it was increasingly likely that victims were male, aged in their 20s and living in London. Cifas said it was important that employers needed to be alert to fraud, rather than just consumers. There had been a sharp rise in ID fraudsters applying for loans, online retail, telecoms and insurance products, it added. ""For smaller and medium-sized businesses in particular, they must focus on educating staff on good cyber-security behaviours and raise awareness of the social engineering techniques employed by fraudsters. Relying solely on new fraud prevention technology is not enough,"" Mr Dukes said. Katy Worobec, from UK Finance, which represents the banking industry, said: ""Tackling fraud and financial crime is a top priority for the industry. Banks have sophisticated controls in place to safeguard the financial system from fraudsters, and work closely with enforcement agencies and government to identify and disrupt criminal activity."" One victim's story Anil Sharma found out the hard way that fraudsters had enough information about him to obtain new smartphones in his name. Not one but two mobile phone contracts taken out through a well-known high street retailer were posted to his Liverpool home.  He says the chain was quite dismissive of his plight and he was forced to contact the mobile networks to resolve the situation. One was more helpful than the other, Mr Sharma says, but ultimately both accepted that the contracts were taken out fraudulently and cancelled them. As well as taking a good deal of phone bashing to resolve, the identity theft was also stressful - and affected his credit score as well. ""It's very very worrying."" But how did the fraudsters obtain his details? Initially Mr Sharma thought it was the result of losing his wallet a couple of years ago, but Action Fraud says an online breach is the more likely culprit.

A team at the University of Toronto   said installation software for the popular proxy tool Simurgh also implanted keylogging spyware.          Simurgh is designed to anonymise net use and allow access to blocked sites.  However, an added Trojan is said to send data from victims' PCs to a site registered with a Saudi Arabian ISP. This can include the computer operator's username and machine name, as well as every window clicked and every keystroke entered. The developers of Simurgh subsequently posted                           a warning on their website   noting that versions of their software installer downloaded from the file sharing service 4shared had been compromised.          Anti-virus firms Sophos and Avira have also updated their malware scanners to detect the code. Crafted code Morgan Marquis-Boire, a technical adviser at the university's Munk School of Global Affairs, said the Isass.exe file allowed ""persistent access to the victim's computer"" as well as ""data exfiltration"" capabilities. ""This Trojan has been specifically crafted to target people attempting to evade government censorship,"" he added. ""If found to be installed on a computer one must consider all online accounts (email, banking etc) to have been compromised and it is advised that all online passwords be changed as soon as possible."" He noted that a side effect of the code was a lack of navigation sounds in Microsoft's Internet Explorer and other applications. A follow-up post by Sophos noted that although the data was being sent to what appeared to be a Saudi Arabian registered entity, some of the servers being used were in the United States. Sophos stressed that the discovery did not mean that the attack had been instigated by parties in the US, as anyone could have rented the server space. Widespread The news comes as investigators probe a malware attack - dubbed Flame - found to have infected computers in Iran and other parts of the Middle East, which is thought to have been designed to steal sensitive data. However, Sophos suggested that the the Simurgh Trojan was likely to have compromised more computers. ""Unlike Flame, which is highly targeted malware that has only been found on a handful of computers globally, this malware is targeting users for whom having their communications compromised could result in imprisonment or worse,"" wrote Chester Wisniewski, senior security advisor at Sophos,                           on his company's blog  .

ISPs from the US, UK, Netherlands and South Korea have joined forces with campaigners Privacy International to take the agency to task over alleged attacks on network infrastructure. It is the first time that GCHQ has faced such action. The move follows allegations about government snooping made by US whistleblower Edward Snowden. 'Infected with malware' The ISPs claim that alleged network attacks, outlined in a series of articles in Der Spiegel and the Intercept, were illegal and ""undermine the goodwill the organisations rely on"". The allegations that the legal actions are based on include: claims that employees of Belgian telecommunications company Belgacom were targeted by GCHQ and infected with malware to gain access to network infrastructure GCHQ and the US National Security Agency, where Mr Snowden worked, had a range of network exploitation and intrusion capabilities, including a ""man-on-the-side"" technique that covertly injects data into existing data streams to create connections that will enable the targeted infection of users the intelligence agencies used an automated system, codenamed Turbine, that allowed them to scale up network implants German internet exchange points were targeted, allowing agencies to spy on all internet traffic coming through those nodes While the ISPs taking the action were not directly named in the leaked Snowden documents, Privacy International claims that ""the type of surveillance being carried out allows them to challenge the practices... because they and their users are at threat of being targeted"". Privacy International has previously filed two other cases - the first against alleged mass surveillance programmes Tempora, Prism and Upstream, and the second against the deployment by GCHQ of computer intrusion capabilities and spyware.

The NPD Group said  last year the number of users on peer-to-peer (P2P) illegally downloading music fell by 17% - down to 21 million worldwide. The market research firm cited an increased use of legal streaming music sites as being behind the drop. It comes as a separate report noted that global music revenues had risen for the first time since 1999. The International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) said that accelerating digital music sales had caused a 0.3% upturn in global revenues - a total of $16.5bn (Â£10.9bn). A small boost, but it is the first year of growth for well over a decade. ""It is hard to remember a year for the recording industry that has begun with such a palpable buzz in the air,"" said Frances Moore, chief executive of IFPI. ""These are hard-won successes for an industry that has innovated, battled and transformed itself over a decade.  ""They show how the music industry has adapted to the internet world, learned how to meet the needs of consumers and monetised the digital marketplace."" Targeted campaign The NPD Group's report, based on its annual study of music consumers, said that at P2P file sharing's peak, in 2005, as many as 33 million people used the services - one in five of all internet users aged 13 and older. But in 2012 that number was measured as being down to 21 million people. The report said as many as 40% of people who used illegal music services in 2011 stopped doing so in 2012. Of those, 20% said this was due to the fact the illegal service they were using had been shut down, or had contained spyware and viruses. More than half the users who stopped using illegal sites said they now preferred legal services such as the UK-headquartered Spotify. The music industry has undertaken a sizable campaign over several years to see illegal sites and services put out of business. In the UK, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) took action to the courts, obtaining a court order to force internet service providers to block access to file-sharing site The Pirate Bay. The Pirate Party UK - a political group that campaigns for an ""open"" internet - launched a proxy service to allow UK users to circumvent the block of The Pirate Bay, but that too was closed following legal threats from the BPI. ""In recent years, we've seen less P2P activity, because the music industry has successfully used litigation to shut down [P2P client] Limewire and other services,"" said Russ Crupnick, senior vice president of NPD.  ""Many of those who continued to use P2P services reported poor experiences, due to rampant spyware and viruses on illegal P2P sites."" Removing barriers Despite the seemingly good news, controversial measures to curb piracy further are still taking place. On Tuesday, the ""six strikes"" campaign - where users engaging in piracy are given six warnings before action is taken - came into force in the US. The music industry has also started to refocus its efforts by targeting those who make profiting from illegal music possible, such as advertisers, as well as the piracy sites themselves. Elsewhere, search engines like Google have been pressured to demote piracy websites in their search results. More needs to be done on that front, IFPI said: ""Searches for the names of popular artists followed by the term ""mp3"" still return a large number of results for illegal sources on the first page.  ""In August 2012, Google announced it would take into account the number of valid copyright notices it receives when returning search results.

In browsing terms, it was a mover and shaker.  image copyright MOzilla image caption The first release of Mozilla Firefox ...especially as IE began to be plagued by serious security concerns. Spyware, adware and computer viruses used vulnerabilities in the way IE was set up to install itself on users' computers. There was a security scandal in 2006 when it was discovered it was possible for rogue websites to steal information or take control of users' computers.  In 2008, the US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (CERT) recommended turning off the ActiveX controls inside IE because of security concerns.  In August 2014, CERT told users to ditch  IE  entirely until it was patched.  Not good. image copyright Google image caption The old Google Chrome logo By then, Chrome was on the scene. It arrived in 2008, lightweight and speedy with countless extensions and 'apps' (often just websites) available from the Chrome store. It quickly powered its way to dominance - it now has 51% usage share worldwide, according to StatCounter.  What you might not know is Chrome almost didn't happen because Google's boss, Eric Schmidt, didn't want to go through ""bruising browser wars"" and Google was a comparatively small company at the time. As Chrome grew in popularity, IE appeared to be entering its twilight years, at least reputation-wise. These memes sum up the issues users complained about most. image copyright Meme image copyright Meme image copyright Meme image copyright Meme image copyright Meme Such was its reputation that a story which suggested that users of  Internet Explorer  have a lower IQ than people who chose other browsers was picked up by news organisations worldwide, including the BBC. It turned out to be a hoax.  Even IE developers knew they had a problem. In a Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) in August, they hoped ""sincerely"" they could change the reputation of IE.  Despite its reputation lots of people do still use Internet Explorer. It comes second or third in most usage share estimates. In fact it is so widely used that some people think Microsoft isn't getting rid of Internet Explorer entirely, because it would hurt the way some organisations operate.  So maybe Internet Explorer is not dead after all, just retiring.  Follow  @BBCNewsbeat  on Twitter,  BBCNewsbeat  on Instagram and  Radio1Newsbeat  on YouTube Related Topics Microsoft"

When users click on an instant message saying ""lol is this your new profile pic?"" they unwittingly download a file containing a Trojan horse malware file. This opens a backdoor allowing hackers to hijack infected PCs and recruit them into a ""botnet army"". Users can be locked out of their machines and held to ransom.  According to internet security specialist Sophos, the worm is a variant of the well-known ""Dorkbot"" worm which has been spread by social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. When the worm infects a computer it sends out the ""lol"" message to the user's contact list. Unsuspecting recipients think the message has originated from someone they know and click on the link, thereby downloading the malware payload. Hijacked computers Skype said in a statement: ""Skype takes the user experience very seriously, particularly when it comes to security. We are aware of this malicious activity and are working quickly to mitigate its impact.  ""We strongly recommend upgrading to the newest Skype version and applying updated security features on your computer.  ""Additionally, following links - even when from your contacts - that look strange or are unexpected is not advisable."" Botnets are often used to mount distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks - forcing websites offline - to run spyware or to send out spam emails. Publicity about the threat has made many users wary of clicking on strange-looking links posted via social networks, which may have prompted the perpetrators of this latest attack to switch tactics. ""The danger is, of course, that Skype users may be less in the habit of being suspicious about links sent to them than, say, Facebook users,"" said Sophos's senior technology consultant Graham Cluley.

That's according to Avon and Women's Aid, who talked to 2,000 people. The study also suggests that many women don't realise they're in a coercive relationship until they break up. A  new law  was introduced in December which means domestic abusers who control victims via social media or spy on them online could face up to five years in prison. The legislation, brought into force in England and Wales, targets people who put their partners or family members through psychological and emotional torment but stop short of violence. Stats from the study suggest 21% of women only knew they'd been in a controlling relationship after it had ended and 9% when friends and family pointed it out. The survey also revealed that... â¢ 1 in 20 women say being scared of their partner is normal and acceptable. â¢ 10% of women regard their partner repeatedly checking their phone as a normal and acceptable part of a relationship.  â¢ 5% of women regard being told what they can and cannot wear as normal and acceptable. image copyright Thinkstock Chlo, who's 18 and from Brixton, south London, was a victim of domestic violence. She says she was too young to realise that she'd been in a controlling relationship. ""My ex was my first boyfriend, and I think it's often the case that young people don't have the experience of healthy relationships to know that what's happening isn't normal.  ""It's so easy just to think 'all couples argue', especially when someone is telling you that you provoked them all the time.  ""And once they start wearing down your self-esteem and isolating you, it spirals to a point that you can't see a way out."" In 2014, Newsbeat talked to Mark Kirkpatrick. media caption Mark Kirkpatrick spoke exclusively to Newsbeat His former girlfriend, Gemma Hollings,  almost killed him  after a row in May that year. ""She was alright in the first few weeks,"" he said.  ""I thought it was a passing thing when she became controlling. ""She started telling me not to wear shorts. She wouldn't let me have my hair shaved even though that's how it was when she first met me. ""It got violent after a few weeks of living at hers. She pushed me, tried strangling me."" The government says coercive behaviour can take any number of forms, including: * isolating a person from their friends and family * depriving them of their basic needs * monitoring their time * monitoring a person via online communication tools or using spyware * taking control over aspects of their everyday life, such as where they can go, who they can see, what to wear and when they can sleep * depriving them of access to support services, such as specialist support or medical services * repeatedly putting them down such as telling them they are worthless * enforcing rules and activity which humiliate, degrade or dehumanise the victim * forcing the victim to take part in criminal activity such as shoplifting, neglect or abuse of children to encourage self-blame and prevent disclosure to authorities * financial abuse including control of finances * threats to hurt or kill * threats to a child * threats to reveal or publish private information (e.g. threatening to 'out' someone) * assault * criminal damage (such as destroying household goods) * rape * preventing a person from having access to transport or from working The survey is part of Women's Aid and Avon's  Love Don't Feel Bad  campaign.

The ""booby-trapped wire-tapping devices"" found in the villages of Zrariye and Rzay, north of the Litani river, were bombed on Monday, it added. The devices had earlier been found by members of the military wing of the Shia Islamist movement, Hezbollah. Israel has not commented. Lebanon has accused its neighbour in the past of planting similar spying devices. Lebanon has been in a state of war with Israel since 1973, while Hezbollah fought a 34-day war with Israel in 2006 that left some 1,200 Lebanese and 160 Israelis dead. Investigation On Monday, Hezbollah's al-Manar television reported that the ""Zionist spying devices"" had tapped into the group's private wired telecommunications network. ""The detection came within the framework of an ongoing spyware detection [operation],"" a Hezbollah statement said.  ""Subsequently, the enemy detonated the device remotely, but no-one was hurt due to the high level of alert and caution of the resistance technicians."" Al-Manar said one of the spying devices contained more than 20 boxes and batteries. The device was found on a hill near the border and was linked via an 80m cable to transmission equipment pointing towards Israeli military posts, it added. Hezbollah said Israel's ""persistent attacks"" on its telecommunications network constituted a violation of Lebanese sovereignty and threatened the safety and security of the Lebanese people. The Lebanese army later confirmed that there had been three blasts in Zrariye and Rzay at 17:15 local time (14:15 GMT) on Monday. ""A military expert went to the area and it turned out that the explosions resulted from the bombardment by the Israeli enemy of three booby-trapped wire-tapping devices. An investigation is under way to uncover the circumstances of the incident."" There were similar incidents involving alleged Israeli spying devices in December 2011 and February 2012.

This week we speak to Luis von Ahn, co-founder and chief executive of language learning app Duolingo. If anyone ever doubts the positive impact of immigration tell them about Luis von Ahn. A 41-year-old from the Central American nation of Guatemala, he went to the US in 1996, aged 18, to do a maths degree at Duke University in North Carolina. After that he studied computer science at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Luis went on to become a computer science professor, specialising in ""human-based computation"", which in very simple terms is how humans and computers can best work together to solve complicated tasks. For his pioneering work in that field he was awarded the US's prestigious  MacArthur Fellows Program award.  This is colloquially known as the ""genius grant"", because you are said to have to be one to get it. image copyright Luis von Ahn image caption Luis first got interested in computers at the age of eight Luis then became a multimillionaire by his early 30s, after selling not one but two businesses to Google. The technology he sold to the search engine giant is still used by all of us, as will be explained later. Fast forward to today, and Luis is the co-founder and boss of Pittsburgh-based Duolingo, the world's most popular language-learning app, which has more than 300 million users around the globe.  Soft-spoken and bespectacled, Luis modestly says that the much of his success is down to the fact that he was lucky enough to be taught English as a child. A native Spanish speaker, he says that his doctor mother insisted that he learned English from a very young age. His middle class family then had enough money to send him to a private English language school in the capital Guatemala City.  Luis says this obviously put him in a very privileged position compared to most Guatemalans - almost half of the country's population live in poverty,  according to the World Bank,  with 9% in extreme poverty. Many have limited access to education. image copyright Duolingo image caption Duolingo users have to answer a series of questions The inspiration behind Duolingo was to create a language learning app that was free for people to use - be it in Guatemala, or around the world - so that they could gain the economic advantages that often come with being at least partially bilingual. ""I wanted to do something that would give equal access to education to everyone,"" says Luis. ""And then I focused on languages because growing up in Guatemala I saw that everyone wants to learn English. ""And knowledge of English in a non-English speaking country can usually mean that your income potential is doubled. I mean, you literally make twice as much money if you know English. So that's kind of where the idea came from to have a free way to learn languages, and that was Duolingo."" Luis and co-founder Severin Hacker started work on the app in 2009. At the time Luis was a professor at Carnegie Mellon, and Severin was one of his students. Bringing on board linguistics and language retention experts, Duolingo launched in 2012, initially offering a handful of languages, including English, French and Spanish. ""When we launched I was lucky enough to be able to give a TED Talk that was watched by two million people, so that gave Duolingo a good initial base of users,"" says Luis. ""But from then until 2019 our growth was solely due to positive word of mouth, we didn't do any advertising or marketing at all."" image copyright Duolingo image caption The company's headquarters is in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania Today Duolingo offers more than 100 courses across 28 different languages. While the most popular languages are English, Spanish and French, you can study everything from Arabic to Ukrainian. Duolingo also has a special focus on promoting minority languages, with courses in Welsh, Navajo, Gaelic and Hawaiian. Dr Sylvia Warnecke, a senior lecturer in languages at The Open University in Scotland, says that she was very pleased to see Duolingo work with leading Gaelic speakers to launch that course last year. ""Duolingo gets criticism from some that you cannot learn enough to be come proficient in a language... but it is a wonderful way of getting people started,"" she says. ""For lots of people learning a language is a slog, and they don't have the time to sign to sign up for formal classes on a weekly basis. Apps like Duolingo are a valuable alternative."" Duolingo now has annual revenues of $90m (Â£69m). Some $15m of this comes from the adverts included on the free, standard app, while $75m is from the 2% of users who pay for the advertisement-free premium version. image caption Luis was inspired by the idea of being able to help people in Guatemala and other countries learn English or another second language for free ""If you use Duolingo heavily and you are relatively wealthy then you should pay us, that is my sense,"" says Luis. ""But if you are in a developing country and don't have very much money, then the free version is for you. That's how I feel about it."" Now with 200 employees, Luis hopes that Duolingo can float on the stock market in 2021. He is said to have a substantial, but minority stake in the business, which already has some outside investors. More  The Boss  features: Dan Aykroyd: From battling spirits to selling them The billionaire retailer whose shops had no stock The entrepreneur stopping food waste 'Fashion industry's pollution made me cry' Going back in time, the two businesses Luis sold to Google were the ESP Game and Recaptcha. ESP, which stands for Extra Sensory Perception, was an online game in which two people, who could not communicate with each other, had to pick words to describe a photograph. When they used the same word they each got a point, and were presented with another photo. Since 2006 Google has used this technology to improve its image search software. image copyright Duolingo image caption Former US President Barack Obama is a fan of Luis and his company Meanwhile, Recaptcha is the now widely used system whereby a Google-linked website asks you to type out words that are written in squiggly handwriting as a means of proving that you are not a so-called ""bot"" or malicious software. An estimated 200 million people have to do this every day, and Luis invented it. Recaptcha, which was solely owned by Luis, was bought by Google in 2009 for an undisclosed eight-figure sum. What is little known is that the words you have to write out are not chosen at random. Instead they are words from old physical books that Google is digitising, and its software is struggling to decipher. So every time you do one of those security tests you are an unpaid Google worker. If, say, 10,000 people all agree on a certain spelling, then Google accepts that as correct. Back at Duolingo, Luis says he is proud to be helping so many people learn a new language. ""We are giving free language education to everyone,"" he says. Related Topics Language Computing Entrepreneurship Computers"

He said the firm might demote likes and follows, adding that in hindsight he would not have designed the platform to highlight these. He said that Twitter currently incentivised people ""to post outrage"". Instead he said it should invite people to unite around topics and communities. ""It may be best if it becomes an interest-based network,"" he told TED curators Chris Anderson and Whitney Pennington Rodgers. Rather than focus on following individual accounts, users could be encouraged to follow hashtags, trends and communities. Doing so would require a systematic change that represented a ""huge shift"" for Twitter. On the topic of abuse, he admitted that it was happening ""at scale"". image copyright TED image caption Chris Anderson asked Mr Dorsey why he seemed to lack urgency in dealing with the problems on Twitter ""We've seen harassment, manipulation, misinformation which are dynamics we did not expect 13 years ago when we founded the company,"" he told TED curator Chris Anderson. ""What worries me is how we address them in a systematic way."" He has previously discussed the role played by likes and follows, which were designed to be prominent. ""One of the choices we made was to make the number of people that follow you big and bold. If I started Twitter now I would not emphasise follows and I would not create likes. ""We have to look at how we display follows and likes,"" he added. Ms Pennington Rodgers asked him why, according to Amnesty, women of colour on average received abuse in one of 10 tweets they posted. ""It's a pretty terrible situation,"" Mr Dorsey admitted. ""The dynamics of the system makes it super-easy to harass others."" He said that Twitter was increasingly using machine-learning to spot abuse and claimed that 38% of abusive tweets were now identified by algorithms and then highlighted to humans, who decide whether to remove them from the platform. He also said that the firm was working on making it easier to find its policies on abuse and was simplifying them. Asked if he would show urgency in dealing with the issues, he replied simply: ""Yes."" Ask Jack The TED audience were invited to contribute to the conversation via the hashtag #askJackatTED, which received more than 1,000 questions within 10 minutes of the talk starting. One of the questions came from journalist Carole Cadwalladr who spoke at TED on Monday and called on the tech firms, including Twitter, to directly address the issue of misinformation being shared widely on their platforms. But in her question to Mr Dorsey, she turned her attention to abuse she has received on Twitter. ""I'd like to know why a video that showed me being beaten up and threatened with a gun to soundtrack of Russian anthem stayed up for 72 hours despite 1000s of complaints?"" she wrote. Mr Dorsey did not address that question and neither did he answer another one about how to deal with the huge number of malicious bots posting misinformation. He was also shown a graph created by Zignal Labs which showed the number of human tweets versus tweets from suspected bots talking about topics in the recent election campaign in Israel. Bots seemed to dominate when it came to tweets about contender Benny Gantz, who was narrowly defeated by Benjamin Netanyahu.  Mr Dorsey was asked about this but did not answer. Instead he said that the company was in the middle of measuring the ""conversational health"" of the platform, using a number of metrics, including how toxic conversations were and how much people are exposed to a variety of opinions. ""We have to create a healthy contribution to the network and a healthy conversation. On Twitter right now you don't necessarily walk away feeling you learned something.""

Dozens of users report having had their accounts suspended until they provided a telephone number which they then had to verify, to prove they were real. Some members have raised concerns about their amount of lost followers, and claimed discrimination against right-wing political beliefs. Others have in turn mocked allegations of bias. ""Twitter's tools are apolitical, and we enforce our rules without political bias,"" the social network has said in response. ""Every day we proactively look for suspicious account behaviours that indicate inorganic or automated activity, violations of our policies around having multiple accounts, or abuse.  ""And every day we take action on any accounts we find that violate our terms of service, including by asking account owners to confirm a phone number so we can confirm a human is behind it.  ""This is part of our ongoing, comprehensive efforts to make Twitter safer and healthier for everyone."" The firm allows  automated software to be used to send tweets  under some circumstances, but forbids the posted content from being misleading. It has also  issued new guidance  about the use of automation and having multiple accounts. The action follows an indictment announced last week by special counsel Robert Mueller against 13 Russian nationals and three Russian firms. They are alleged to have used fake accounts on Twitter  and other social media platforms  to conduct ""information warfare against the United States"". Twitter and Facebook had faced criticism from US lawmakers earlier in the year for not having taken the problem seriously enough.

""This is a company that's under a lot of heat to clean up its act in terms of how its platform has been exploited to spread misinformation and junk news,"" said Samantha Bradshaw from the University of Oxford's Computational Propaganda Project.

Stream  or  download  the latest  Tech Tent  podcast Listen live every Friday at 15.00 GMT on the BBC World Service Following the mass shooting at a Florida school, conspiracy theorists and other trolls harassing some of the survivors were spreading stories that  those who spoke out for gun control  were actors.  The Twitter Safety account highlighted action the company was taking, and also revealed that it was using what it called anti-spam and anti-abuse tools, to weed out ""malicious automation"" - bots that retweet abusive messages thousands of times, amplifying their impact.  In other words, both the social media firm and the troll army it is fighting are deploying what you might describe as autonomous weapons made possible by advances in machine learning. Twitter has also been rooting out bots apparently linked to Russia, following the indictment of 13 Russians believed to have created fake accounts to conduct information warfare against the US. That means that one of the scenarios described in a report on potential  malicious use of artificial intelligence  published this week has already come true. One of the global experts behind the report, Haydn Belfield from Cambridge University's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, tells us that what he calls ""AI-enabled interference"" in the democratic process is one of their major concerns.

""It's very cheap and very easy to pump this stuff out and it really undermines the ability to continue a functioning democratic conversation in society."" image copyright Getty Images image caption The threat of AI is real and many of the technologies are already developed, warn 26 leading experts Not smart But do the bot armies which Twitter is battling really amount to an example of artificial intelligence - however widely defined - and are they really as potent a threat as has been claimed? Samantha Bradshaw, a researcher from the Computational Propaganda project at the Oxford Internet Institute, is rather more sceptical. She tells us that Twitter is finding it quite easy to spot automation and the bot creators are taking notice. ""We're seeing a lot of bot developers taking a step back from automation, and instead blending automation with human curation,"" she said. That means they will post new comments, along with the automated retweets, to show that a ""real person"" is behind the account. While the spotlight has been on Russia when it comes to this wave of computational propaganda and other types of cyber-warfare, one expert tells us we should be more worried about North Korea. Dmitri Alperovitch is the Russian-born US cyber-security entrepreneur who founded Crowdstrike, the company which first identified Russian involvement in the hacking of America's Democratic Party. But he tells us that North Korea has spent 15 years building cyber-warfare capabilities, including ""breaking into financial institutions and stealing hundreds of millions of dollars,"" and hacking Sony Pictures after it made a jokey film about the regime. What seems extraordinary is that a country that is so impoverished and so closed off from the outside world should be able to pose a serious cyber-warfare threat to  the United States, the world's technology superpower. ""Anyone who can build a nuclear weapon can certainly do cyber,"" said Mr Alperovitch, explaining this is a kind of asymmetric warfare, where attack is easier than defence. Cyber-warfare techniques and artificial intelligence have advanced a long way in recent years. Linking the two fields could bring new threats to our security that we cannot imagine today.

Egor Igorevich Kriuchkov is accused of offering an employee $1m (Â£721,000) to place ransomware in the computer network of the company's battery plant in Nevada. He planned to use the ransomware to steal company secrets for extortion, prosecutors alleged. The 27-year-old pleaded guilty on Thursday in Reno, Nevada. Mr Kriuchkov acted on behalf of criminals abroad and tried to bribe a Tesla employee in person, prosecutors said. Ransomware attacks companies or organisations by scrambling their internal computer networks, stealing information or locking users out. The attackers then demand large sums of money in return for ending the hack. What is ransomware? The teenager getting rich through hacking Elon Musk loses world's richest title as Tesla falters The FBI said the planned attack on Tesla was stopped before it could take place.  Mr Kriuchkov told a court in September that the Russian government was aware of the planned hack, but the FBI and lawyers have not alleged that there were ties to the Kremlin.  ""The swift response of the company and the FBI prevented a major exfiltration of the victim company's data and stopped the extortion scheme at its inception,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Nicholas McQuaid said in a statement.  Mr Kruichokov was in the US for five weeks on a tourist visa in July and August last year when he tried to recruit the Tesla employee,  according to court documents reported in US media. He was quoted as saying that he and his co-conspirators would steal the data, and if Tesla refused to pay the ransom the company's secrets would be placed on the internet. The  US Department of Justice said that he took the employee out for drinks  multiple times and gave him a phone. After the employee told Tesla about the plan, the company contacted the FBI who instructed the employee to record their conversations with Mr Kruichokov. Mr Kruichokov faces up to ten months in prison after signing a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty,  according to technology website The Record.

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419|"Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks? By Mary-Ann Russon Business reporter, BBC News Published 13 hours ago Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks. Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.  Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware. However,  the new report  comes on the back of a recent significant  security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system . And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with. So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried? How a firmware attack works  Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.  Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers. This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system. Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers unsecured Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber-crisis Cyber-flaw affects 745,000 pacemakers Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware. ""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.  Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security. ""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot."" image copyright Sophos image caption A screenshot of the RobbinHood ransomware There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as  RobbinHood , a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware  held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019 .  Another example is  Thunderspy , an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other. This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep. ""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.   ""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more."" Big organisations beware The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops). ""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC. Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software,  because they only make money  if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.  Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The pandemic has led to a sharp rise in devices connecting remotely to critical corporate network infrastructure The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws. The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years. Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.  Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.  Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds. ""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do."" Creeping soon to a network near you Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole,  to pay attention to hardware security . image copyright Getty Images image caption Hardware and firmware designers need to be included in the cyber-security discussion, say experts ""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.  ""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected."" Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.  ""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.  ""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55811165|"Insurers defend covering ransomware payments By Zoe Kleinman Technology reporter Published 27 January Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images The Association of British Insurers (ABI) has defended the inclusion of ransomware payments in first-party cyber-insurance policies. It said insurance was ""not an alternative"" to doing everything possible to first minimise the risk. However, it added that firms could face financial ruin without the cover. Prof Ciaran Martin, former head of the National Cyber Security Centre, said the UK needed to rethink its policies on ransomware. 'Funding organised crime' Ransomware is a form of malware in which infected computers are remotely locked by cyber-criminals, who then demand a ransom, often in the form of Bitcoin, to unlock them and return the data they hold. There are many examples of businesses and public bodies which have chosen to pay because they do not have the data backed up, or cannot afford - or do not have time - to rebuild their systems from scratch. The Guardian reported that Prof Martin, now at Oxford University's Blavatnik School of Government, said he believed insurers were ""funding organised crime"" by accepting ransomware claims, but he told the BBC the issue of how to tackle ransomware was far broader than just the insurance sector. While official advice is not to pay the demand, it is not illegal to do so in the UK, he said. ""I have some sympathy with insurers, because as long as it's legal, there are incentives to pay."" While the ransom demand may be high, the alternative impact can also be devastating. When the global aluminium producer Norsk Hydro was attacked in 2019,  it cost the firm around Â£45m , and its profits in the immediate aftermath plummeted by 82%,  reported Reuters .   Norsk Hydro refused to pay the demand, which would arguably have been cheaper - but it did have insurance. A spokesman for the ABI said insurers do require that ""reasonable precautions"" are taken to prevent cyber-attacks from succeeding in the first place, just as cars and houses require security measures in place to deter thieves. ""Some might argue that any insurance that covers against a criminal act could lull the policyholder into a false sense of security,"" he said. Prof Martin said he did not think that banning ransomware insurance claims would necessarily solve the problem. ""But it's worth a serious piece of consultation because if we continue as we are, things will get worse,"" he said.

CD Projekt Red said hackers had accessed its internal network, digitally scrambled some of its data servers and tried to blackmail it. The perpetrators claim to have stolen source code for several of the firm's games which they said they would leak unless a payment was made. But the Polish games company said it would not negotiate. In a statement on Twitter,  CD Projekt Red posted a copy of the ransom note which said the hackers had copied code from Cyberpunk 2077, Gwent, and Witcher 3, including an unreleased version of the latter. âWe have also dumped all of your documents relating to accounting, administration legal, HR, investor relations and more!â the note added. ""Dumping"" means copying the information to an external source. âIf we will not come to an agreement, then your source codes will be sold or leaked online and your documents will be sent to our contacts in gaming journalism,â read the note, giving a deadline of 48 hours. Source code is the human-readable version of a computer program before it is transformed for use. Releasing it could make it easier for people to write hacks for the titles or even publish their own altered versions, as well as reveal some of their development secrets. In a statement, posted by the game developers on Twitter, it said it has secured its âIT infrastructure and begun restoring the dataâ from back-ups. âWe will not give in to the demands or negotiate with the actor,â it said, adding that no personal data had been compromised in the breach. The company has informed law enforcement and data protection authorities, while it investigates the issue. media caption Keanu Reeves talks to BBC Sounds podcast Press X to Continue This is the latest in a series of bad news for the developers after the release of Cyberpunk 2077 was delayed several times, only for users to then experience glitches in the game. ""This will be frustrating for users of the game, but as consumers are generally very sympathetic when something like this happens,"" said Louise Shorthouse, senior gaming analyst at Ampere Analysis.  ""This comes after a string of recent ransomware attacks on games companies, including Capcom and Ubisoft late last year. ""Fixes and updates for Cyberpunk 2077 may take a backseat for a while, as mitigating the effects of the ransomware attack becomes the priority."" This probably couldn't have come at a worse time for the embattled games studio. However, its response has been extraordinary and is already being praised by the cyber-security world.  In one Tweet, the company has demonstrated a new gold standard response to dealing with ransomware. The company is being transparent about the attack but also says it is not negotiating with the cyber-criminals and instead relying on well-managed back-up systems. CD Projekt Red has even released a screen grab of the ransom note which will be invaluable for researchers. It doesn't sound like much and there will be questions about how the firm was able to be breached in the first place. But in a world of empty press releases and companies secretly paying criminals huge ransoms, CD Projekt Red has shown what can and, in the eyes of many, should be done to deal with the growing problem of ransomware hacking.

Experts say the trend towards ransoming sensitive private information could affect companies not just operationally but through reputation damage. It comes as hackers bragged after discovering an IT Director's secret porn collection. The targeted US firm has not publicly acknowledged that it was hacked. In its darknet blog post about the hack last month, the cyber-criminal gang named the IT director whose work computer allegedly contained the files. It also posted a screen grab of the computer's file library which included more than a dozen folders catalogued under the names of porn stars and porn websites. The infamous hacker group wrote: ""Thanks God for [named IT Director]. While he was [masturbating] we downloaded several hundred gigabytes of private information about his company's customers. God bless his hairy palms, Amen!"" The blog post has been deleted in the last couple of weeks, which experts say usually implies that the extortion attempt worked and the hackers have been paid to restore data, and not publish any more details. The company did not respond to requests for comment. The same hacker group is also currently trying to pressure another US utility company into paying a ransom, by posting an employee's username and password for a members-only porn website. 'The new norm' Another ransomware group which also has a darknet website shows the use of similar tactics. The relatively new gang has published private emails and pictures, and is calling directly for the mayor of a hacked municipality in the US to negotiate its ransom. In another case, hackers claim to have found an email trail showing evidence of insurance fraud at a Canadian agriculture company. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, says the trend points to an evolution of ransomware hacking. ""This is the new norm. Hackers are now actually searching the data for information that can be weaponised. If they find anything that is incriminating or embarrassing, they'll use it to leverage a larger pay-out. These incidents are no longer simply cyber-attacks about data, they are full-out extortion attempts."" Another example of this was seen in December 2020, when the cosmetic surgery chain The Hospital Group was  held to ransom  with the threat of publication of 'before and after' images of patients. Ransomware is evolving Ransomware has evolved considerably since it first appeared decades ago. Criminals used to operate alone, or in small teams, targeting individual internet users at random by booby-trapping websites and emails. In the last few years, they've become more sophisticated, organised and ambitious. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Criminal gangs are estimated to be making tens of millions of dollars a year, by spending time and resources targeting and attacking large companies or public bodies for huge pay-outs, sometimes totalling millions of dollars. Brett Callow has been following ransomware tactics for years, and says he saw another shift in methods in late 2019. ""It used to be the case that the data was just encrypted to disrupt a company, but then we started seeing it downloaded by the hackers themselves. ""It meant they could charge victims even more because the threat of selling the data on to others was strong."" Tough to defend against  This latest trend of threatening to publicly damage an organisation or individual has particularly concerned experts because it is hard to defend against. Keeping good backups of company data helps businesses to recover from crippling ransomware attacks, but that is not enough when the hackers use extortionware tactics. media caption Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers Cyber-security consultant Lisa Ventura said: ""Employees should not be storing anything that could harm a firm reputationally on company servers. Training around this should be provided by organisations to all their staff. ""It's a troubling shift in angle for the hackers because ransomware attacks are not only getting more frequent, they are also getting more sophisticated. ""By identifying factors such as reputational damage, it offers far more leverage to extort money from victims."" A lack of victim reporting and a culture of cover-up makes estimating the overall financial cost of ransomware difficult. Experts at Emsisoft estimate that ransomware incidents in 2020 cost as much as $170bn (Â£123bn) in ransom payments, downtime and disruption.

The Harris Federation, which runs 50 primary and secondary academies in and around London, said it had temporarily disabled email while it deals with the cyber-attack. Data on the systems has been encrypted and hidden by the attackers. Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a warning that hackers are targeting schools. 'Sophisticated attack' âWe are at least the fourth multi-academy trust to have been targeted in March,â  a statement on the Harris Federation website  said.  âThis is a highly sophisticated attack that will have a significant impact on our academies but it will take time to uncover the exact details of what has or has not happened, and to resolve. âAs a precaution, we have temporarily disabled our email system.â Any devices which the Harris Federation have given to pupils have also been disabled, the statement added.  However, schools have recently returned to in-person learning as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions - meaning students can still attend classes. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Harris Federation schools break up for Easter later this week. Its statement did not detail what information or data has been compromised, and it has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. The trust is working with âa specialised firm of cyber-technology consultantsâ, the National Crime Agency and the NCSC to resolve the issues. The NCSC said it has ""recently alerted the education sector to the significant threat posed by ransomware attacks"" and urged schools and colleges to follow its advice to protect themselves online. It used to be the case that ransomware groups concentrated their efforts on large multinational companies. Big corporate budgets and potential business interruption mean large ransom payouts. Publicly funded schools and colleges are therefore an odd and particularly cruel target. One hacker group recently posted part of their negotiation conversation with another unnamed institution on the dark net. It made for grim reading, and once again showed me how ruthless they are. At one stage, when the hackers demanded $15m, the school wrote: ""Sir, please, this is NOT a business with profits. We operate much like a charity operates. This is a state-funded school, our salaries are paid for by taxing the people that live in the state. We have no idea how you think we can afford this.""

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56372188|"Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers remain unsecured Published 12 March Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright BBC / Getty Images More than 3,000 UK email servers remain at risk from the global Microsoft Exchange email flaw, officials believe. The National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured. It said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it. The agency said it was ""vital"" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers. The announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week. Ransomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far. Once installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data. Free-for-all The security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system , which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide. The NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue. Initially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data. But after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw. The result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack. ""We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,"" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned. ""While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates."" He also urged all organisations to ""familiarise"" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised. An emerging picture The true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone. What is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact. While many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low.  That may change in the coming days as more reports come in.  What is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.

Owners of its products had been unable to use its services since Thursday. However, some of its online tools are now being provided in a ""limited"" state,  according to its online dashboard . Garmin has said it was ""the victim of a cyber-attack that encrypted some of our systems"". But the statement it released avoided any reference to a ransom demand. ""Many of our online services were interrupted including website functions, customer support, customer-facing applications, and company communications,"" it said. ""We have no indication that any customer data, including payment information from Garmin Pay, was accessed, lost or stolen."" The firm added that it expected all its systems to return to normal operation within a few days, but warned that there might be a ""backlog"" of user data to process. It is not known if the firm paid the blackmailers, but a source told the BBC it was in the ""final stage of recovery"". The BBC's cyber reporter Joe Tidy said the malware involved was Wasted Locker - a program that scrambles the target's data, and was first detected in the wild around April. Victims are typically contacted after their computers are infected, and told they must transfer funds if they want to return the files to their original state. Some customers have already reported that Garmin's services appear to be ""partially"" working again.  Earlier reports claimed that the company had been asked to pay $10m (Â£7.79m) to get its systems back online. Twitter hack: Bitcoin exchange 'blocked 1,000 transactions' How hackers extorted $1.14m from a US university Pilots who use flyGarmin were unable to download up-to-date aviation databases, which aviation regulators such as the FAA require pilots to have, before they can fly. Customers were also unable to log into Garmin Connect to record and analyse their health and fitness data. There have been many high-profile attacks in recent months, but few victims have been as tight-lipped as Garmin. Even now, despite confirmation from many different sources across different newsrooms, the company is choosing not to admit it was ransomware. The big question is whether or not the company paid the blackmailer what is likely to be a multi-million dollar demand. It seems the company has somehow got the decryption key it needs to start bringing services back online. As well as customers and shareholders, the US authorities will be very keen to know what happened. Members of Evil Corp, the criminal group that's suspected of being behind the hack, were indicted in 2019 by the US Treasury.

Human Rights Watch and the children's mental health charity, Young Minds, have also confirmed they were affected. The hack targeted Blackbaud, one of the world's largest providers of education administration, fundraising, and financial management software. The US-based company's systems were hacked in May. It has been criticised for not disclosing this externally until July and for having paid the hackers an undisclosed ransom. In some cases, the data was limited to that of former students, who had been asked to financially support the establishments they had graduated from. But in others it extended to staff, existing students and other supporters. The institutions the BBC has confirmed have been affected are: University of York Oxford Brookes University Loughborough University University of Leeds University of London University of Reading University College, Oxford Ambrose University in Alberta, Canada Human Rights Watch Young Minds Rhode Island School of Design in the US University of Exeter All the institutions are sending letters and emails apologising to those on the compromised databases. In some cases, the stolen data included phone numbers, donation history and events attended. Credit card and other payment details do not appear to have been exposed. Blackbaud, whose headquarters are based in South Carolina, declined to provide a complete lists of those impacted, saying it wanted to ""respect the privacy of our customers"". ""The majority of our customers were not part of this incident,"" the company claimed. It referred the  BBC to a statement on its website : ""In May of 2020, we discovered and stopped a ransomware attack. Prior to our locking the cyber-criminal out, the cyber-criminal removed a copy of a subset of data from our self-hosted environment."" The statement goes on to say Blackbaud paid the ransom demand. Doing so is not illegal, but goes against the advice of numerous law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, NCA and Europol.  Blackbaud added that it had been given ""confirmation that the copy [of data] they removed had been destroyed"". Several Blackbaud clients listed on its site have confirmed they were not affected, including: University College London Queen's University Belfast University of the West of Scotland Islamic Relief Prevent Breast Cancer ""My main concern is how reassuring - impossibly so, in my opinion - Blackbaud were to the university about what the hackers have obtained,"" commented Rhys Morgan, a cyber-security specialist and former student at Oxford Brookes University, whose data was involved.  ""They told my university that there is 'no reason to believe that the stolen data was or will be misused'.  ""I can't feel reassured by this at all. How can they possibly know what the attackers will do with that information?"" image copyright Getty Images image caption Oxford Brookes University is among those contacting students about the hack Blackbaud has said it is working with law enforcement and third party investigators to monitor whether or not the data is being circulated or sold on the dark web, for example. Barrister blogger Matthew Scott was also sent an email about the hack. ""I doubt that my university has many details that aren't pretty easily available, but I am more concerned about giving in to the blackmail and blithely accepting the word of the blackmailer that all the data has now been destroyed,"" he told the BBC. Privacy law Under General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), companies must report a significant breach to data authorities within 72 hours of learning of an incident - or face potential fines.  The UK's Information Commissioner's Office [ICO], as well as the Canadian data authorities, were informed about the breach last weekend - weeks after Blackbaud discovered the hack. An ICO spokeswoman said: ""Blackbaud has reported an incident affecting multiple data controllers to the ICO. We will be making enquiries to both Blackbaud and the respective controllers, and encourage all affected controllers to evaluate whether they need to report the incident to the ICO individually."" Leeds University said, in a statement: ""We want to reassure our alumni that, since being informed by Blackbaud of this incident, we have been working tirelessly to investigate what has happened, in order to accurately inform those affected. No action is required by our alumni community at this time, although, as ever, we recommend that everyone remains vigilant.""

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56365372|"Exchange email hack: Hundreds of UK firms compromised By Joe Tidy Cyber reporter  Published 11 March Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Reuters Hundreds of UK companies have been compromised as part of a global campaign linked to Chinese hackers. Cyber-security firm Eset said more than 500 email servers in the UK may have been hacked, and many companies are not aware they are victims of the attack. It comes as governments around the world warn organisations to secure their systems. But some experts fear it may be too late, as at least 10 hacking teams are capitalising on the chaos. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre has joined US authorities in issuing warnings about the hack, but says it is still assessing the situation for UK businesses. Meanwhile, the Norwegian cyber-authority is actively scanning for at-risk companies in the country and warning them directly. 'Zero-day' The hacking campaign was first announced by Microsoft on 2 March and blamed on a Chinese government-backed hacking group called Hafnium. Microsoft said the group was using four never-before-seen hacking techniques to infiltrate the email systems of US companies. The attackers targeted the popular email system Microsoft Exchange Server, used by large corporations and public bodies across the world. US warns of 'active threat' over Microsoft attack EU bank authority hit by Microsoft email hack Microsoft email server hacks put Biden in a bind Microsoft released software updates for the so called ""zero-day"" exploits and urged customers to install them to protect themselves. However, the hacking has escalated from straightforward espionage to crisis levels, with some reports estimating tens of thousands of organisations could be affected. 'Race now on' According to cyber-security researchers at Eset, as many as 10 different hacking groups are now actively using the zero-days exploits to target companies in 115 different countries.  Cyber-researchers at FireEye also confirmed they had detected multiple groups, likely to be based in China, using the exploit in different waves. ""As always, it is complex but it is very likely that Hafnium gifted these 'zero days' to government-sanctioned groups to actively use the flaws once they were rumbled,"" Jake Moore at Eset said. ""The race is now on for all of those affected to patch immediately and then painstakingly check for any recent compromises and make sure no webshells are installed on the servers."" media caption Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers Webshells being dropped A webshell is a piece of computer code that can act like a backdoor into a computer network.  Once installed, hackers have a foothold in a network and can either steal or spy on email messages, or use the access to launch more crippling cyber-attacks. Globally, Eset says it has detected the backdoors on 5,000 separate servers - and more than 500 of them are in the UK. Cyber-security responders are racing to find out which companies have been hacked, and remove the webshells to kick the hackers out of their systems. Beware the second wave CyberGuard Technologies says it is dealing with 42 separate cases where hackers have installed webshells, with the number rising by the hour. The companies range from financial institutions, manufacturing and retail. Sean Tickle, head of CyberGuard, said: ""It's widespread and very much a case of hackers hosing their attacks at as many targets as they can before companies can secure their systems. ""It only takes someone to alter this approach to drop a more malicious malware package and we're going to see some real hurt for the companies that fall behind.  ""There's already rumblings that these shells are being used, and I think we're going to see mass ransomware attacks happen as a second wave of this.""

Systems at Redcar and Cleveland Council  have been down for almost three weeks  after the ransomware attack. It said it had been prioritising frontline services and has now built a new server and website, as well as mobilising a temporary call centre. However, there may be a short delay in letting children know which secondary school they have got places at. Since the attack on 8 February, the council has been working with the National Cyber Security Centre and the National Crime Agency. Joe Tidy BBC cyber security reporter It has taken 19 days for the council to admit they are dealing with a ransomware attack.  This particularly nasty form of hack is unique and a growing problem for large targets like public authorities and companies. Informing the public their council is being held to ransom is a key piece of information that many think people have a right to know. It makes the situation far more serious as hackers are in control of computer systems and possibly sensitive data.  The only options are to pay the cyber criminals or rebuild from scratch by using offline backups, which is often far more costly. With private firms the decision over whether or not to pay is often taken at board level behind closed doors but Redcar and Cleveland is a tax-payer funded body and residents may begin to demand transparency about how their money is being used. Councillor Mary Lanigan, leader of the council, said: ""Significant progress has been made.  ""All frontline services have continued, payments continue to be processed as normal, and there is no evidence so far to suggest any personal information has been removed from our servers. ""However, it may be some time before our IT capabilities are fully restored which may mean frustration for the public in dealing with us administratively."" The delay in informing parents and carers of secondary school places would not affect the actual allocation, and it was anticipated primary admissions would be made on time, she said.

It is the first time that the agency - part of the GCHQ intelligence service - has given guidance to a sector caring for such young children. It includes warnings to use password protection for information for parents. ""We know that incidents affecting the education sector are increasingly common,"" said Sarah Lyons at the NCSC. Bigger target The cyber-agency says pre-school providers and childminders are ""increasingly relying on technology to operate"" and have become an ""appealing target"" for cyber-attacks. â¢Cyber threat to disrupt start of university term University cyber-attack to take weeks to fix Cyber-criminals could be seeking personal information about children or families, and to target the payments process for parents, warns the NCSC. The  early years cyber-security advice  warns about malicious software, so-called ""malware"", and the need to protect personal information and data. ""Cyber-criminals will go after anybody, provided there's money to be made,"" says the NCSC's advice. The cyber-security agency calls for a more secure approach to sharing information, including newsletters for parents. ""You should password protect newsletters so only families who have been given the password can open them,"" says the guidance. Scam emails The NCSC says many scam emails are ""preying on fears of Covid-19"" and warns nurseries and child minders to watch out for fake messages trying to obtain information with false claims, including: resetting passwords,  receiving compensation missed deliveries. There are also warnings about protecting computer devices, including smartphones, and to guard against scam phone calls and text messages. Education at all age groups has become a significant target for cyber-attacks. A big multi-site further education college, the South and City College Birmingham, has been forced to close by a ""major ransomware attack"" - with the college telling students to  stay home this week . Universities faced a wave of cyber-attacks last autumn, targeting research and data and causing disruption to computer systems. The NCSC is now widening its advice to the early years sector. Sarah Lyons, deputy director for economy and society engagement at the NCSC, said across educational settings it was ""vital that all providers know how to secure their devices and sensitive data"". But she said many people in early years ""work on their own, without dedicated IT support"". ""This guidance sets out the practical first steps they can take to protect themselves from cyber-incidents."" ""Like most professions, the early years sector is increasingly reliant on technology, and this new guidance will support them with protecting sensitive data,"" said Vicky Ford, children and families minister. ""It is paramount that early years settings have robust cyber-security in place to help them communicate with children, families and staff delivering early education and childcare provision safely,"" she said.

The Action Fraud team said Â£34.5m had been stolen since 1 March 2020. It covers activity in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, but not Scotland. In a related development, the National Cyber Security Centre has told the BBC it is tackling about 30 ""significant attacks"" a month against the country's pandemic response infrastructure. These involves attempts to breach the NHS, vaccine producers and vaccine supply chains, among other organisations. ""There unfortunately have been a number of successful ransomware incidents against businesses - I can think of roughly around 10,"" NCSC operations director Paul Chichester said. image caption This is one of the scripts used to con victims to believe they were talking to their bank Twin peaks Other figures disclosed by City of London Police, which co-ordinates efforts to combat fraud, include: more than 150 related arrests were made since the pandemic began more than 2,000 websites, phone numbers and email addresses linked to the crimes were taken down there was a total of 416,000 reports of fraud and cyber-crime  The activity peaked between April and May 2020, and January 2021 - both times when lockdowns were in force. The Dedicated Card and Payment Crime Unit, which tackles criminal gangs responsible for financial fraud and scams, worked with social media platforms to take down over 700 accounts linked to fraudulent activity in 2020, of which over 250 were money mule recruiters. But this may be the tip of the iceberg. The National Crime Agency estimates that just one in five fraud cases are typically reported to the police.  And the volunteer-run Cyber Helpline told the BBC only a quarter of those who had contacted it after a cyber-attack said they had also reported the incident to the police. Bank loan scam Many of the scams involved conning people out of their money and financial details by focusing on internet shopping. Related fraud was 42% higher over the pandemic than the preceding year, as criminals took advantage of the fact many physical stores had been forced to close. Anna - not her real name - from Cheltenham was one of thousands of people who received an SMS message asking her to go online and rearrange a parcel delivery.  She filled in her details, but later suspected something was wrong. She alerted her bank and cancelled her bank card. image caption Anna came close to being thousands of pounds out of pocket ""I thought, now I have nothing to worry about, everything is fine and case closed,"" she told the BBC. But the criminals used the details they had already obtained to authorise her bank to credit her account with a Â£9,000 loan. And a short while later they called her, pretending to be the bank.  Not realising the scam, Anna told them she had not taken out a loan.  ""They gave me the sort code and bank account number I needed to pay back the loan, and said if I paid the Â£9,000 there wouldn't be any charges. ""But then I was still feeling suspicious, so I Googled the sort code, and it came up with a completely different bank."" So, Anna called her bank directly and realised the scammers had returned.  ""I didn't lose any money but it did feel like a real burglary to be honest,"" she said.  She closed her account, and changed her email address and mobile number. But she still does not feel safe.  Email attack Charities are also common targets.  One in three charities suffered a cyber-attack during the first 10 months of the pandemic, according to Ecclesiastical Insurance. One victim actually specialises in offering cyber-security advice to others. Hackers got inside Charity Digital's network for seven days without being detected. They compromised its email accounts and sent false invoices to clients. The organisation's chief executive, Jonathan Chevallier, told the BBC the breach had not been noticed in part because all his staff had been working from home. Charity Digital spent more than Â£10,000 investigating the attack and has produced an online webinar to help others avoid a similar fate.

However, it did not name the facility or say when the attack happened. A malicious link sent to staff at the facility eventually caused the shutdown ""of the entire pipeline asset"". It was so severe in part because the organisation was not prepared for such an attack, the DHS statement said. The incident was detailed  in a security alert. , which revealed it to be a ""spear-phishing"" attack, in which individuals are sent fraudulent but believable scam messages. That let the attacker into the company's IT network. How did that shut down a pipeline? Often, the ""operational network"" which runs computers in the factory is separated from the office IT - but not in this case, meaning the ransomware infection was allowed to spread.

""We will continue to divert any new admissions, other than those that are critical, to other facilities,"" DCH said in its statement.

Officials indicated the attack over the weekend was co-ordinated. The Texas Department of Information said the attack had primarily affected smaller local government departments. A spokesman said the situation was still ongoing on Monday morning. Texan authorities have drafted in cyber-security experts, as well as the military and counter-terrorism units, to help bring systems back online. In a statement,  the Texas Department of Information Resources said evidence suggested the attacks ""came from one single threat actor"". Officials did not release specific details of the affected departments or say whether the cyber-criminals had specified a ransom amount. Ransomware is a type of malicious software that cyber-criminals use to disable a computer and its data until a ransom is paid. Hackers have targeted a number of US states this year, paralysing government computers in New York, Maryland and Florida. In May, hackers seized control of  thousands of government computers in Baltimore. The attack disabled email accounts and prevented online payments to city departments for weeks. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? How have cities dealt with ransomware attacks? Officials in  Baltimore refused to pay the ransom,  opting instead to manually process thousands of transactions, including home sales. They also slowly restored access to around 10,000 employee email accounts. The city estimated losses of around $18m (Â£15m) from the attack. The hackers originally demanded $100,000 worth of Bitcoin. Other cities have chosen to pay. In June, council leaders in  Riviera Beach, Florida, voted to pay almost $600,000  in the digital currency Bitcoin to hackers who paralysed the city's computer systems for weeks. A week later, officials in  Lake City, Florida paid hackers $500,000  following a similar ransomware demand. Lisa Forte, a partner at Red Goat Cyber Security, which specialises in cyber-security testing, said ransom payments left cities vulnerable to more attacks.

""Our automated security systems disabled the accounts due to the bulk creation of multiple consumer Gmail accounts from the same network,""  Google told the BoingBoing website.

The New York Times reported on Saturday that a hacking vulnerability known as EternalBlue has been exploited to blackmail Baltimore's local government. The NSA discovered the flaw, but the paper claims that its cyber-spies kept the discovery secret for years. The NSA declined to comment. But the report has particular resonance as the organisation is headquartered at Fort Meade, Maryland, which is a short drive from Baltimore. ""We don't have anything for you on this,"" an NSA spokesman told the BBC. The EternalBlue flaw has been implicated in a range of cyber-attacks over the past three years, including the WannaCry assault that disrupted the UK's NHS. It involves a bug in old versions of  Microsoft's Windows operating system  that allows other malicious code to be run on infected computers. The NSA reportedly created a tool to do this, which it also called EternalBlue. Ethical hackers take bugs to the bank Google thwarts Baltimore ransomware fightback Baltimore government held hostage by hackers' ransomware The New York Times said the agency did not disclose the problem to Microsoft for more than five years until a breach forced its hand. Microsoft released a fix for EternalBlue flaw in March 2017. Weeks later, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers  leaked the NSA's related hacking tool online . The NSA has never confirmed how it came to lose control of its code nor officially commented on the affair. But the suggestion is that if it had shared its findings with Microsoft at an earlier stage, fewer PCs would have been exposed to subsequent attacks that made use of the vulnerability. Email lock-out Thousands of Baltimore's city government computers were frozen on 7 May after their files became digitally scrambled. The criminals responsible demanded 13 Bitcoin ($114,440; Â£90,200) to unlock them all, or three Bitcoin to release specific systems ahead of a deadline, which has now passed. The authorities refused. image copyright City of Baltimore image caption The city's website informs vistors that it cannot currently process online payments Local residents have been unable to pay utility bills, parking tickets and some taxes online as a consequence.

""We must ensure that the tools developed by our agencies do not make their way into the hands of bad actors,"" the senator told the paper. Some security experts say if EternalBlue is truly involved, then IT managers should have installed a patch long ago. Eternalblue was released over two years ago..

""Specialised systems such as medical devices, for example, often go unpatched for long periods of time. ""Offsetting that risk are factors such as the devices not being internet-connected. although given we're still seeing infections due to EternalBlue two years after it was patched, evidently there are still systems out there both unpatched and exposed."" On the ground in Baltimore: It's not exactly the talk of the town here - after all, it's not like Facebook has gone down, merely crucial public services.

One person told me about how they have been unable to pay for their wedding venue at a place part-owned by the city.  Another told me they couldn't go online to pay a parking ticket - that's not as fortunate as it sounds, trust me.  A further kick in the teeth for this city is the suggestion that this attack used an exploit discovered not by the Russians or Chinese, but by an organisation based just 20 miles away - the US National Security Agency.

The data has been put on the dark web - a part of the internet associated with criminality and only accessible through specialised software.  Sepa chief executive Terry A'Hearn said: ""We've been clear that we won't use public finance to pay serious and organised criminals intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds. ""We have made our legal obligations and duty of care on the sensitive handling of data a high priority and, following Police Scotland advice, are confirming that data stolen has been illegally published online.

'Serve as a warning to future victims' Brett Callow, of cyber security company Emsisoft, has been tracking the Sepa ransomware attack. He said: ""Conti may well be the work of the same people behind another type of ransomware called Ryuk.  ""There are similarities in the code, ransom note and attack mechanisms. ""When the complete haul of data is posted like this, it usually means the group has given up hope of being able to extract payment from the victim of monetise the data in other ways.  ""It's a loss for them. At this point, they've lost all leverage and the action is intended to serve as a warning to future victims."" Det Insp Michael McCullagh, of Police Scotland's cybercrime investigations unit, said: ""This remains an ongoing investigation.  ""Inquiries remain at an early stage and continue to progress including deployment of specialist cybercrime resources to support this response."" The authorities will be pleased. It looks like Sepa decided not to play ball with the cyber criminals. Ransomware is a scourge that is costing organisations billions of pounds and every time a victim pays, it fuels further attacks. Sadly for Sepa this is far from over.  By the looks of the stash of files that the hackers stole and encrypted, Sepa will have months of work ahead to try to recover important documents and spreadsheets from backups and rebuild their records. It's also telling that, according to the hackers website, almost 1,000 people have so far looked at the documents.  Who knows what other criminals or hackers are poring over the files right now.  Making the documents open to all means that information can be extracted to potentially be used against Sepa in further attacks or extortion attempts.

Baltimore this week rolled out a ""manual workaround"" to allow real estate transactions to proceed during the outage.  But citizens are unable to access online sites to pay their water bills, property taxes and parking tickets. And 10,000 city government computers are locked, leaving employees with no email.

How a ransomware attack cost one firm Â£45m The cyber-attack that sent an Alaskan community back in time Raspberry Pi used to steal data from Nasa lab The town's insurer was contacted by the hackers and negotiated ransom payment of 42 bitcoins, or roughly $500,000. Officials felt that paying the ransom was the most efficient way of regaining computer access. ""I would have never dreamed this could have happened, especially in a small town like this,"" mayor Stephen Witt told local media. Insurance would cover the vast majority of the ransom payment, he added, although $10,000 would be incurred by taxpayers. Switch to paper Just last week, it was reported that another Florida municipality had paid $600,000 in Bitcoin to hackers following a similar ransomware attack. The computer infection in Riviera Beach, a suburb of Palm Beach, affected email as well as emergency response systems and forced staff to switch to using paper for some tasks. Ransomware attacks have become an increasingly common tool for cyber-criminals. Municipal staff in one Alaskan community  reverted to using typewriters  after their computers were hit by ransomware last year. Attacks have also affected the US cities of Baltimore and Atlanta as well as towns in California, North Carolina and Ohio, among other places. In 2016,  three US hospitals were hit by ransomware infections . ""Ransomware is the canary in the coal mine,"" said cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont, who argued that the spate of attacks showed organisations needed to get better at basic IT security.  ""Organisations are financing their attackers to be better than them - and sooner or later that situation may snowball for everybody else trying to defend their networks."" media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? He advised having robust back-ups and disaster recovery protocols to avoid being crippled by ransomware, should it strike. Cyber-security experts have consistently advised not paying ransoms as there is no guarantee files or computer systems will be restored. But recovering from a ransomware infection without paying up is also expensive.  The large aluminium manufacturer Norsk Hydro recently became a victim of ransomware and decided not to pay the hackers. Nonetheless, the cost of recovering from the attack  has so far totalled Â£45m.

Many firms do out of desperation, turning to intermediaries to help broker the deal. But law enforcement says this just makes things worse. Imagine the excitement when hackers gained a foothold in the computer system of Norsk Hydro, a global aluminium producer.  We don't know when it was, but it's likely that once inside they spent weeks exploring this group's IT systems, probing for more weaknesses. When they eventually launched their ransomware attack, it was devastating - 22,000 computers were hit across 170 different sites in 40 different countries.

It read: ""Your files have been encrypted with the strongest military algorithms... without our special decoder it is impossible to restore the data."" media caption Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers The entire workforce - 35,000 people - had to resort to pen and paper.  Production lines shaping molten metal were switched to manual functions, in some cases long-retired workers came back in to help colleagues run things ""the old fashioned way"".  In many cases though, production lines simply had to stop. Imagine the hacker's anticipation as they waited to receive a reply to their ransom note. After all, every minute counts for a modern manufacturing powerhouse. They probably thought they could name their price. But the reply never came. The hackers were never even asked how much money they wanted. Imagine the shock.  All that work. For nothing. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? It's been more than three months since Norsk Hydro was attacked and they are still many months away from making a full recovery. It's so far cost them more than Â£45m. But what they've lost in productivity and revenue, they've arguably gained in reputation.  The company's response is being described as ""the gold standard"" by law enforcement organisations and the information security industry. Not only did they refuse to pay the hackers but they've also been completely open and transparent with the outside world about what happened to them.  But there are many other companies and organisations who make the opposite choice, and evidence is growing that ransomware hackers are increasingly being paid off secretly by victims - and their insurance companies - looking for the easy way out.  ""It's become a simple business case for many organisations to pay, and at this point it's a known secret that this is happening,"" says Josh Zelonis, cyber-security analyst at Forrester.  image copyright Getty Images image caption A ransomware attack can cause huge damage to a company's operations Secrecy surrounds the practice because organisations are concerned about the possibility of litigation and the damage to their reputations following an attack, says Mr Zelonis.  ""And a lot of the time incident response companies are being brought in to broker the transaction with the adversaries themselves in order to ensure that the payment is made and recovery is possible,"" he says. Sources in the information security industry have described multiple occasions when large, well-known companies have paid out thousands of pounds - in some cases hundreds of thousands - to hackers and not told the public or even shareholders.  More Technology of Business Why the age of electric flight is finally upon us How a struggling airline went soaring through the cloud The super-tough drones and robots going where we can't How to cope with email overload How fish and shrimps could be recruited as underwater spies Just last week,  a Florida town paid hackers $600,000 (Â£475,000)  to get its computers working again after a ransomware attack disabled email, hit emergency response systems and forced staff to use paper-based admin systems. It's a troubling trend that's prompted Europol, the European Union's law enforcement agency, to re-issue its warning that paying ransoms fuels hackers and often leads to more organised crime. One US-based company, Coveware, specialises in negotiating ransoms between hackers and their victims. Visiting its offices in Connecticut, it's clear it operates at the sharp end of cyber-crime.  There is no permanent office, instead people move around shared workspaces. The entire team is dispersed around the world.  image caption Coveware's Bill Siegel says ransomware attacks can destroy a company Chief executive and founder Bill Siegel admits that the service is an ""unpalatable"" one, but insists that it is needed. He wouldn't give details on the companies that he's helped but says: ""At any one time we have half a dozen to a dozen cases, some of the companies are big, including public companies and name brands."" The company's own research indicates that the hackers' demands, usually an exchange of untraceable Bitcoin, are increasing. ""Ideally we wouldn't pay or we'd negotiate down a lot,"" says Mr Siegel, ""but we recognise that when a company needs to pay - and it's a large number - then that's what needs to happen, and that can be seven figures.  ""Everybody recognises that this is not a good outcome but you're dealing with the life or death of a company."" The most infamous ransomware virus was called WannaCry and infected 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, including causing notable disruption to the National Health Service in the UK.  Since then ransomware attack numbers have actually declined significantly. Cyber Security vendor Trend Micro estimates that numbers could have dropped 91% in the past year. But data from many other vendors points to a rise in more targeted attacks, where companies and organisations, instead of individuals, are in the cross-hairs. image caption Norsk Hydro's Jo De Vliegher says ""it's a very bad idea to pay"" Researchers at cyber-security company Malwarebytes say that compared to the same time last year, business detections of ransomware have risen more than 500%.  Back at Norsk Hydro, Mr De Vliegher said he tries not to think of the hackers and takes no satisfaction in knowing he foiled their plans.  ""I think in general it's a very bad idea to pay,"" he says. ""It fuels an industry and it's probably financing other sorts of crime. It goes against our company values and we have good foundations and good people. ""But I understand why, for some companies who are less secure, this can be the only option."" His words are echoed by Europol's head of the European Cybercrime Centre, Steven Wilson.  ""Companies need to understand that if you continue to pay a ransom it perpetuates the crime,"" he says. ""It encourages the criminals to commit further crimes.  ""If you pay, you're fuelling organised crime on a global basis.""

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55411830|"Health to be on cyber-security's front line in 2021 Gordon Corera Security correspondent, BBC News @gordoncorera on Twitter Published 28 December 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images Covid-19 catapulted the health sector to the forefront of cyber-security in 2020, but the next year is likely to see the dangers continue and evolve.  Threats from nation states and criminals to the health system are a growing concern. The huge logistical challenge of rolling out vaccines faces the risk of disruption to complex supply chains. And criminal ransomware poses a threat at a time when the pandemic has increased our reliance on technology. Supply chain The distribution of the various coronavirus vaccines may bring relief, but it also brings with it a major challenge: many of those involved have not had to think hard about security in the past. The complex global supply chain for vaccines ranges from factories in one country to internet-connected fridges in another.  It will create new pressure on doctors' surgeries, IT systems, and sometimes small providers who play a critical role.  IBM has already said it has seen  suspected state-hackers target the ""cold chain""  used to keep supplies at the right temperature during transportation. And in the UK, the National Cyber Security Centre, which worked quickly when the pandemic began to secure vaccine research, has since pivoted its efforts towards vaccine distribution.  At least the large pharmaceutical companies are no stranger to cyber-espionage. Their security officials say they first began thinking hard about the issue after a major espionage campaign back in Spring 2010.  But the issues around the pandemic have changed the sector's importance.  ""We are now on a grander stage,"" is how one person involved puts it. In July, the UK accused Russian intelligence of targeting research, including for the Oxford vaccine, while the US accused Chinese hackers of similar activity. The emergence of ""vaccine nationalism"" led intelligence and security officials to raise questions about whether countries could try and undermine the efforts of others going forward.  ""It could be trying to steal the intellectual property for financial purposes,"" Tonya Ugoretz of the FBI told a recent Aspen Institute Cyber Summit. ""It could be to undermine confidence... or to advantage another country's own development. ""We see our most determined nation-state adversaries not just relying on one method to target the supply chain, but combining cyber with using more traditional espionage and human sources.""  One much discussed tactic is the deliberate spread of misinformation online about vaccinations, or questioning a country's safety and testing record.  The UK Army's 77th Brigade has supported a Cabinet Office investigation into whether foreign states are driving anti-vaccine fears within the UK.  Most sentiment was domestically generated, head of Strategic Command General Sir Patrick Sanders said at a recent Chatham House event. image copyright Getty Images image caption General Sir Patrick Sanders is the head of Strategic Command, which helps manage joint force operations And he raised the possibility of retaliation. ""Where these things are being fuelled from overseas, then we will take action, and if the NCF (National Cyber Force) has a part to play in that, it will."" Cyber-blackmail campaigns But despite concerns about states, experts say, criminal ransomware - the locking of people out of their computers and data until they pay - remains the more serious and persistent threat.    There was some talk at the start of pandemic from criminal gangs that they would not target health. But it did not last and attacks have multiplied.  A recent report from security firm Positive Technologies says half of all the cyber-attacks on healthcare were ransomware in the July-to-September quarter of 2020. US hospitals have been worse hit than the UK. It is thought this is because criminals see them as richer than their NHS counterparts. In just 24 hours in October, six American hospitals received ransom demands of at least $1m (Â£810,000), leading to some cancer treatments being cancelled.  image copyright EPA image caption Ransomware gangs often take a copy of the data they leave scrambled on their targets' computers ""The healthcare sector has become such a big, rich, juicy target,"" Greg Garcia, executive director for the US Cybersecurity of the Health Sector Co-ordinating Council, recently said. ""It's as if they moved on from the financial services sector."" 'Don't weaponise the net' warns former cyber-chief UK cyber-threat agency confronts Covid-19 attacks The UK has made stride to fix weaknesses in the NHS systems exposed by 2017's Wannacry ransomware attack. Even so, there are concerns it could be hit again. Dr Saif Abed has long warned that such an attack could kill a patient. He is a former NHS doctor who left clinical practice to set up the AbedGraham group, which advises on IT security risks to health. ""The thing that's really concerning is that attackers now understand the concept of clinical urgency,"" he says.  ""They understand: 'If we create a risk that disrupts the ability to provide patient care, we're more likely to get a payout.'"" His worry is that the pandemic has accelerated the digitisation of health. While that has brought benefits such as consultations taking place online, he says the investment needed to keep internet-connected systems and devices secure has not kept pace. Dr Abed says he often hears security researchers talk about hacking insulin pumps to kill someone.  But he says a bigger risk is the fact that more devices are being connected together while remaining vulnerable, leading to the risk of a cascade effect. He adds that his biggest worry is that criminals move from just locking organisations out of their health data to starting to tamper with it, posing risks to patient safety. The desire to limit further Covid-19 outbreaks may also create a further drive to share data more broadly.  And that in turn may present further opportunities to steal or subvert it. Another sign that the cyber-security of health is likely to be on the front line in 2021.

Hydro, which employs more than 35,000 people in 40 countries, says the attack began on Monday night and is ongoing. Some of the company's factories have been forced to halt production though other facilities, including its power plants, are functioning normally. The firm's website is down but  updates are being posted to Facebook . US factories were among those affected, as were smelting plants in Norway. Notices have been posted at the entrances to some of Hydro's offices telling employees not to log in to their computers. Staff worldwide are instead using mobile phones and tablets to access their emails, according to Hydro's chief financial officer Eivind Kallevik. At some factories, workers are using printed order lists while they remain unable to retrieve order data from their computers. Norwegian security authorities said they were investigating the possibility that the cyber-attack was caused by a relatively new form of  ransomware  known as LockerGoga. However, they added it was not yet clear that this was the case.  A spokesman for Hydro also told the BBC that he could not yet confirm who was behind the attack. image caption Hydro's main public-facing website is currently offline He added that digital systems at Hydro's main smelting plants were programmed to ensure machinery worked efficiently. However, these systems had had to be turned off at some of the facilities. ""They are much more reliant today on computerised systems than they were some years ago,"" a spokesman said. ""But they have the option of reverting back to methods that are not as computerised, so we are able to continue production."" Work was also stopped at some metal extrusion plants, where aluminium is processed into products such as building facades. Relying on back-ups The firm said it was working to contain and ""neutralise"" the attack and added that it had not caused any safety-related incidents. It added that it had data backups ready with which to restore systems once the virus had been dealt with. Norway's state cyber-security agency is helping Hydro to respond to the incident. Cyber-security expert Kevin Beaumont told the BBC that if the LockerGoga ransomware had been used, it would likely have been deployed to Hydro's systems manually by an attacker. This could have been done by someone who had gained administrator access to those systems. ""For an industrial manufacturing business this is potentially bad news, as it may have spread across their company, including near industrial control systems,"" added Mr Beaumont.

It said international groups were likely to be behind the ransomware attack that has locked its emails and contacts centre. More than 1GB of data has been stolen, including information about staff.  Police Scotland and the National Cyber Security Centre are investigating.  Sepa subject of 'significant cyber attack' Cyber security specialists have identified the theft of about 1.2 GB of data with indications suggesting that at least 4,000 files may have been accessed and stolen. The company's internal communications have also been locked but but Sepa said ""priority regulatory, monitoring, flood forecasting and warning services were continuing to adapt and operate"". Sepa (Scottish Environment Protection Agency) said a number of systems, including email, would remain badly affected for some time and it was likely that new systems would have to be built from scratch. Information submitted to Sepa by email since Christmas Eve is not currently accessible.  This has been an incredibly sophisticated attack on Scotland's environmental regulator which has locked their IT systems and crippled them now for three weeks. We know that the cyber criminals have been in touch demanding money but it seems unlikely they will succeed. There's no suggestion climate change activism is at the heart of this ransomware attack, even though it's the environmental regulator being targeted. The hack has all the hallmarks of Russian organised cyber criminals - although Sepa will not confirm that. Critical services like flood forecasting are unaffected but entire systems will have to be rebuilt and it's unlikely the 1,300 workers will be able to get access to their old emails and online files. The agency confirmed last week that following the attack at 00:01 on Christmas Eve, business continuity arrangements were immediately enacted and the agency's emergency management team was working with Scottish government, Police Scotland and the National Cyber Security Centre to respond to ""complex and sophisticated criminality"". Sepa's chief executive Terry A'Hearn said: ""Partners have confirmed that Sepa remains subject to an ongoing ransomware attack likely to be by international serious and organised cyber-crime groups intent on disrupting public services and extorting public funds. ""Work continues by cyber security specialists to seek to identify what the stolen data was. Whilst we don't know and may never know the full detail of the 1.2 GB of information stolen, what we know is that early indications suggest that the theft of information related to a number of business areas. ""Some of the information stolen will have been publicly available, whilst some will not have been."" Specialist services He said direct contact would be made as quickly as possible with affected organisations. Mr A'Hearn added that staff members affected were being supported and given access to specialist advice and services. Det Insp Michael McCullagh, of Police Scotland's cybercrime investigations unit, said: ""This remains an ongoing investigation. Police Scotland are working closely with Sepa and our partners at Scottish government and the wider UK law enforcement community to investigate and provide support in response to this incident. ""Inquiries remain at an early stage and continue to progress including deployment of specialist cybercrime resources to support this response.

Arran Brewery said it was locked out of its own computer system after being duped into opening an email attachment that contained a virus. According to the firm, the culprits then demanded two bitcoins, worth a total of Â£9,600, to restore its system. Arran said it declined to pay, despite losing three months' worth of sales data from one server. The company added that it had since used an IT consultant to eliminate the virus, and it was working on restoring the lost data. What is ransomware? Ransomware involves computer viruses that threaten to delete your files unless you pay a ransom. Like other viruses, it usually finds its way onto a device by exploiting a security hole in vulnerable software or by tricking somebody into installing it.  Arran Brewery managing director Gerald Michaluk described the attack as ""very devious"". He said: ""We advertise job vacancies on our website. One such job vacancy was for a credit control and finance assistant post, now filled.   ""Out of the blue we started getting applicants for the post from all over the country and the world.   ""I assumed one of my colleagues had advertised the post. However, this was not the case; the attackers had taken our website vacancy and posted it on some international jobs site.   ""We were getting three of four emails a day, all with attached CVs. The virus was in amongst the genuine job seekers, and when the CV was opened it took effect."" He added: ""I hope if anyone finds themselves in a similar position they can recognise the MO of these bandits and not have the same issues we have had."" 'Don't pay ransom' Gerry Grant, chief ethical hacker at the Scottish Business Resilience Centre, said ransomware remained a popular ""attack vector"" for criminals. He said: ""It can be very difficult to verify every single email that comes in but you should be suspicious about attachments from people you don't know or are not expecting. ""My advice to people is that they should not pay any ransom because there is no guarantee that those responsible won't ask you for more money even if you pay up.

The publication on the dark web of the personal details of council staff and residents follows ""a serious cyber-attack"" on the council in October.  Experts said the data was ""limited"" and ""not visible through search engines"". Officials continue to work with the UK National Cyber Security Centre and National Crime Agency to investigate the hack, the council said. Hackney Council's cabinet member for planning, Guy Nicholson, said the hack had affected services residents relied on, including by disrupting the ability of the council  to process land search requests for those buying property. Many residents have complained on social media about how the disruption has cost them financially and derailed house purchases. Cyber-attack causes property purchases to collapse Hackney Council services remain affected by hack Jessica told the BBC the hack broke the chain on her and many other people's house purchases. She told the BBC: ""It's extremely frustrating as the hack has ruined our plans and cost us money that we'll never get back. The sale of our property fell through because our buyer wasn't able to carry out a search on our house so couldn't get a mortgage.  ""Subsequently we lost the house we were planning on buying and had already spent more than Â£1,000 on a survey for.  ""We were hoping to have the house sorted in time to make use of the  stamp duty holiday , but that's not looking likely.""  'Worry and upset' The council said the vast majority of sensitive or personal information held by the council remained unaffected. It added that it would support any directly affected people. Hackney's mayor Philip Glanville said the hack was ""utterly deplorable"". ""I fully understand and share the concern of residents and staff about any risk to their personal data, and we are working as quickly as possible with our partners to assess the data and take action, including informing people who are affected,"" he said. ""While we believe this publication will not directly affect the vast majority of Hackney's residents and businesses, we are sorry for the worry and upset this will cause them.  ""We are already working closely with the police and other partners to assess any immediate actions we need to take, and will share further information about the additional action we will be taking as soon as we can."" In February last year, another local authority - Redcar and Cleveland Borough Council - was hit by a ransomware attack,  which cost it more than Â£10m. This attack has caused real-world harm to residents.  The fact that people are out of pocket and have had life plans derailed because of a lack of land searches is a side effect to councils being hacked that few could have predicted. The authority isn't saying much, including whether or not they have negotiated with hackers or paid a ransom. Now that the hackers are posting data from their attack on the dark web, it appears we can deduce that they have not got what they wanted.  But we don't know for sure, and this hacker group is notorious for posting or selling data even after promising victims they wouldn't. Ransomware experts at cyber security firm Emsisoft also tell me that the group, known as Mespinoza, are famously very amateurish. Even if Hackney Council did pay, I'm told the data would likely be far too damaged and scrambled to recover.

The Hospital Group, which has a long list of celebrity endorsements, has confirmed the ransomware attack. It said it had informed the Information Commissioner of the breach. On its  darknet  webpage, the hacker group known as REvil said the ""intimate photos of customers"" were ""not a completely pleasant sight"". It claimed to have obtained more than 900 gigabytes of patient photographs. The Hospital Group, which is also known as the Transform Hospital Group, claims to be the UK's leading specialist weight loss and cosmetic surgery group. It has 11 clinics specialising in bariatric weight loss surgery, breast enlargements, nipple corrections and nose adjustments. The company has previously promoted itself via celebrity endorsements, although it has not done so for several years. Former Big Brother contestant Aisleyne Horgan-Wallace told Zoo magazine about her breast enhancement surgery with The Hospital Group in 2009. Atomic Kitten singer Kerry Katona, Shameless actress Tina Malone and reality TV star Joey Essex from The Only Way is Essex are also previous patients who have endorsed the clinic. 'Splattered around' The Hospital Group said in a statement: ""We can confirm that our IT systems have been subject to aâ¯data security breach. None of our patients' payment card details have been compromised but at this stage, we understand that some of our patients' personal data may have been accessed."" The company said it had emailed all its customers about the cyber-attack and would contact individuals who might have had more personal details compromised.  It's understood that many before and after pictures will not include the patients' faces. One customer told the BBC he was worried about his pictures and data being in the hackers' hands. Simon Hails had chest reduction surgery with The Hospital Group. He said the company had not told him about the ransom.  ""I have had an email from The Hospital Group informing me of a 'data security incident' but no detail as to what has been hacked,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm obviously concerned as the last thing I want is 'before photos' being splattered around in the public domain. I've tried to keep my surgery private and not even some of my friends and colleagues know about it, so the data breach is concerning for me."" Ransomware is one of the most prolific forms of cyber-attack. It typically involves hackers gaining access to a computer network and either encrypting files or locking users out of their systems until a ransom is paid. More recently, ransomware gangs have been taking a copy of the data and threatening to release it. Law-enforcement agencies discourage victims from paying the ransom because doing so fuels the criminal enterprises. Cyber-security company Emsisoft estimates that the burgeoning form of cyber-crime has earned criminals $25bn (Â£18bn) in 2020. REvil, also known as Sodinokibi, is one of the most prolific ransomware groups. Its high-profile victims include currency exchange Travelex and entertainment law firm Grubman Shire Meiselas & Sacks. In September, The Hospital Group said surgery requests had increased by 25% since 2019. Its chief executive Tony Veverka told the ITV News Tonight programme at the time that Covid-19 health concerns had prompted the spike, as people tried to find ways to lose weight.

The Port released a statement saying the malware had infiltrated its computer network and was disrupting administration systems. It said the attack had not stopped ships or boats using the port, or put members of the public in danger. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security are helping the Port investigate and clean up in the wake of the outbreak. ""This is mainly an administrative issue and normal Port operations are continuing as usual,""  Randa Coniglio, chief executive of the port, said in a statement . The main impact would be on the issuing of park permits, public records requests and general business services, it added. The Port said some of the disruption was because of staff shutting down computers that were in danger of being compromised as the ransomware started to spread.  The organisation did not say which malware was used in the attack but added that payment was being demanded in Bitcoins by the hackers behind the outbreak. The Port is just one of many shipping-related industries that have been hit by ransomware.  In July,  the China Ocean Shipping Company's terminal in Long Beach was briefly closed by a malware attack. Last year, shipping giant Maersk was among the high profile victims of the NotPetya virus and said its business was affected for a couple of weeks. It has said the outbreak cost the company about $200m (Â£153m).

Twenty-two recommendations were made  after the WannaCry attack led to nearly 20,000 cancelled hospital appointments. The Public Accounts Committee said it was ""alarming"" these measures had still not been introduced. The government said cyber-security in the NHS had improved since the attack.  NHS trusts 'at fault' over cyber-attack NHS services hit by cyber-attack The PAC report found the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) and NHS bodies had been ""unprepared"" for the global WannaCry attack, which happened in May and affected more than 200,000 computers in at least 100 countries. 'Serious vulnerabilities' A total of 80 of 236 NHS trusts across England suffered disruption, as well as another 603 NHS organisations, including 595 GP practices. MPs said the attack could have been ""much worse"" and the NHS had been ""lucky"" the threat had been tackled quickly. But they warned future attacks could be more sophisticated and malicious, ""resulting in the theft or compromise of patient data"". In February, the DHSC, NHS England and NHS Improvement published a set of 22 ""lessons learned"" recommendations following the cyber-attack.  But months later the DHSC still did not know what the proposals would cost or when they would be implemented, the committee said. Meg Hillier, who chairs the PAC, said: ""The extensive disruption caused by WannaCry laid bare serious vulnerabilities in the cyber-security and response plans of the NHS. ""But the impact on patients and the service more generally could have been far worse. And government must waste no time in preparing for future cyber-attacks - something it admits are now a fact of life.  ""It is therefore alarming that, nearly a year on from WannaCry, plans to implement the lessons learned are still to be agreed."" image copyright EPA The report said cyber-attacks were ""weapons"" that needed to be treated as a ""serious, critical threat"". It said the use of a nerve agent  to poison former spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia  in Salisbury had ""heightened concerns about the UK's ability to respond to international threats, and hammers home the risks from those hostile to the UK"". The report said: ""A cyber-attack is a weapon which can have a huge impact on safety and security.  ""It needs to be treated as a serious, critical threat.  ""The rest of government could also learn important lessons from WannaCry."" Among other recommendations, the committee called on the DHSC and NHS bodies to urgently agree on and implement cyber-security plans and provide an update on their progress to the committee in June. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Every part of the NHS must be clear that it has learned the lessons of Wannacry.  ""The health service has improved its cyber-security since the attack, but there is more work to do to protect data and patient care. ""We have supported that work by investing over Â£60m to address key cyber-security weaknesses - and plan to spend a further Â£150m over the next two years to improve resilience, including setting up a new National Secure Operations Centre to boost our ability to prevent, detect and respond to incidents.""

Almost 40% of all successful malware-based attacks involved ransomware suggests the  annual Verizon data breach investigations report . The types of systems compromised were changing too, it found, with criminals trying to hit databases not just PCs. It also indicated firms had significant success dealing with some types of cyber-attacks. They had particular success in dealing with attempts to knock web servers offline and spotting phishing emails,  Small firms ""Ransomware breaches doubled last year and could double again this year,"" said Gabe Bassett, senior information security scientist at Verizon who helped compile and write the report. Once ransomware infects a machine it encrypts data until a payment, usually in the form of a popular cryptocurrency, is made.   Mr Bassett said ransomware was popular because it let cyber-thieves quickly cash in on the security mistakes made by firms both large and small. Desktop machines were most likely to be compromised by ransomware, found the report, but attackers had started turning their attention to more critical business systems.  ""We are seeing more and more databases hit as attackers find these systems online and encrypt them,"" said Mr Bassett, adding that the numbers of such attacks trebled last year.  He said these were attractive targets because companies were more likely to pay a high ransom to unlock the business-critical data. image copyright Getty Images image caption Online databases were being sought out by malicious attackers Bill Conner, chief executive at security firm SonicWall said the high-profile WannaCry and NotPetya ransomware attacks in 2017 were behind the growing popularity of the category. And, he added, it was now starting to hit a very ""target rich"" segment. ""Ransomware is really the first time that medium and small companies have been targeted,"" he said. ""But they are least prepared because they have the least money and they cannot go out and hire cyber-experts."" Small steps Ransomware was just one common attack among many in the arsenal of cyber-thieves, said Mr Bassett.  Other popular attacks include:  using stolen credentials to access corporate networks phishing emails that look like they come from reputable financial organisations malicious hackers posing as senior staff who try to push through payments to fake suppliers Despite the relentless tide of attacks, the report also found that companies were enjoying success when fighting off some cyber-threats, said Mr Bassett. Firms were now much less likely to fall victim to phishing and so-called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. DDoS involves swamping a server with traffic so it becomes unresponsive or crashes. ""We know how to deal with DDoS,"" said Mr Bassett. ""We have defences against them and they work."" Statistics in the report suggest server downtime caused by DDoS often only lasts a few minutes. In addition, he said, many companies had got better at dealing with phishing by quarantining the machines of those staff who were most likely to click on a malicious link or document. And, added Mr Bassett, while cyber-attackers put billions of malicious files on the net every year, the number that got through to firms was often quite small. On average, found the Verizon survey, firms received about seven pieces of malware a day. ""That's a threat we can handle,"" said Mr Bassett. ""The reality is that there's a lot that we can do. We can take some simple steps and make it much harder for attackers.""

Most of the lost evidence involves dashcam recordings, said Atlanta police chief Erika Shields  in a local newspaper interview. The footage was ""lost and cannot be recovered"", said Ms Shields. About one-third of all software used by city agencies and departments is believed to have been affected by the attack, which took place in March. Recovery plan Details of the damage done to Atlanta's computer infrastructure emerged during a public meeting held to debate how the city should spend its budget. The hearings revealed that the city has assigned an extra $9.5m (Â£7.1m) to finance its recovery efforts. At the meeting, officials from the city administration revealed that the attack was more severe than originally thought.  More than 140 separate applications were totally or partially disabled by the attack, said Daphne Rackley who heads Atlanta's IT department. About 30% of the affected programs were ""mission critical"" as they were used by either the police or its courts, she said. The municipal courts in Atlanta were shut for several weeks during the height of the attack and huge amounts of legal documents stretching back decades are believed to have been scrambled by the malware. Police chief Shields told the Atlanta Journal Constitution that despite losing the video recordings, no ""crucial evidence"" had been compromised.  Dashcam footage was a ""useful tool"" said Ms Shields, but added that other evidence such as the testimony of an officer would ""make or break"" a case. Files on individual officers' computers were also hit in the attack, although much of this data was backed up elsewhere, she said, so was not entirely lost. The hackers behind the infection, known as SamSam, encrypted key data and demanded $51,000 of bitcoins to unlock it. Atlanta said it had not paid the ransom.

The three, who are not in custody, are also accused of deploying malicious cryptocurrency programs. A Canadian-American citizen was also charged with money laundering. The men are also accused of being part of the Wannacry cyber-attack of 2017, which crippled UK health service computer systems on a national scale. Announcing the charges, Assistant Attorney General for National Security, John Demers, said North Korea ""has become a criminal syndicate with a flag"". One of the defendants, Park Jin Hyok, was previously charged two years ago for his role in  the 2014 hacking of Sony Entertainment Pictures .  Mr Park, Jon Chang Hyok and Kim Il are accused of criminal conspiracy, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and bank fraud. North Korea accused of hacking Pfizer for Covid-19 vaccine data US intelligence task force accuses Russia of cyber-hack NHS cyber-attack was 'launched from North Korea' The Department of Justice says the defendants work for the Reconnaissance General Bureau, North Korea's military intelligence agency. ""North Korea's operatives, using keyboards rather than guns, stealing digital wallets of cryptocurrency instead of sacks of cash, are the world's leading bank robbers,"" Mr Demers said. All three men are believed to be in North Korea, which does not extradite its citizens to face US charges. The Canadian-American man, 37-year-old Ghaleb Alaumary, from Mississauga, Ontario, is accused of being the group's money launderer in a separate case announced on Wednesday. Officials say he has agreed to plead guilty to the charge Satirical source Sony Entertainment Picture's 2014 film, The Interview, is widely believed to have been the initial motive for the attack on the film company. The satirical film, starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, ridicules North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, and centres around a fictitious assassination plot against him.  media caption Ex-hacker Marc Maiffret spoke to the BBC in 2014 about the Sony attack The men are also believed to have had a hand in the WannaCry 2.0 ransomware attack in 2017.  The attack temporarily crippled UK National Health Service (NHS) computer systems and affected more than 150 countries around the world. About 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled. There are broadly three reasons why governments choose cyber-attacks to further their interests: to spy on each-other; to steal intellectual property; or to meddle in politics. This indictment adds further evidence to the theory that North Korea bucks the trend. The politically isolated country is actually far more interested in making money. As the assistant attorney general put it, North Korean hackers are ""the world's leading bank robbers"". Of all the major cyber powers, North Korea has time and time again used its considerable skills to prop up a struggling economy. It's working rather well, too - with well over $1bn in the bank from these hacks alone. While other nations cause chaos and political noise with their hackers, North Korea seems content to quietly continue lining its coffers. The three men hit by the indictment also conducted campaigns targeting US defence and energy contractors. As part of this, Department of State and Pentagon officials were tricked into sharing their credentials so hackers could access their computers.  ""The scope of the criminal conduct by the North Korean hackers was extensive and long-running and the range of crimes they have committed is staggering,"" Acting US Attorney Tracy Wilkison said. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre said it fully supported the criminal charges. ""Working with our allies we are committed to countering malicious activity by state and non-state actors and will defend ourselves from disruptive behaviour in cyber-space,"" said the organisation's director for operations, Paul Chichester.

Up to 350,000 people could be affected , it said, and some of its own financial information had been stolen. The Japanese developer is best known for franchises such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter. A week-and-a-half earlier, it had said there was no indication customer information had been accessed. Digitally scrambled But in an update on Monday, Capcom confirmed its servers had been hit by an attack on 2 November.  Ransomware is malicious software that typically threatens to block a victim's access to their own records unless a blackmail payment is made. In this case, the attackers digitally scrambled some of the data on Capcom's servers, making it impossible to view or amend, and destroyed some files outright. The Ragnar Locker hacker group had then demanded to be paid to undo the encryption involved, Capcom said. On Ragnor Locker's dark-net webpage, the hackers didn't just post Capcom's data but also an ominous message. In broken English they wrote the Japanese company didn't ""make a right decision and save data from leakage"".  This - and the fact Capcom is openly talking about the hack - suggests the company chose not to pay the cyber-criminals' extortion demand. Many, including law enforcement, would actually see this as absolutely the right decision. For 18 months, police the world over have been desperately imploring ransomware victims not to pay hackers. The groups have made millions from companies, which often feel they have no other option but to fork out. But it seems Capcom has found a way through without yielding.  No doubt the incident has affected the firm's reputation and some sensitive data is already surfacing online. But reading the disappointment in Ragnor Locker's statement is refreshing and rare. So far, Capcom has confirmed only nine people's personal information was definitely compromised, all current or former employees. But up to 350,000 customers, business partners, and other employees might also be affected, it said. Although, it could not be sure because its own logs had been ""lost as a result of the attack"". Resident Evil-maker hit in latest gaming hack Game firms targeted as part of global hacking plot The information includes different combinations of names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers and email addresses, depending on why the data was gathered.  For example, some was from Japanese customer support and some from the American Capcom store or e-sports operation. 'Deepest apologies' ""None of the at-risk data contains credit-card information,"" Capcom's statement said.  ""All online transactions... are handled by a third-party service provider. ""And as such, Capcom does not maintain any such information internally."" The company also said it was safe for gamers to continue to play its games online and to use its websites. Police have been notified, as have the Japanese and UK data-protection watchdogs.

The international police organisation Interpol has said it was ""closely monitoring"" the situation and liaising with its member countries. Experts suggest the malware is taking advantage of the same weaknesses used by the  WannaCry attack  last month.

""The ransomware was called Petya and the updated version Petrwrap. ""However, now that's not so clear."" The malware hall of fame What can you do to protect your business?

Kaspersky added that it had detected suspected attacks in Poland, Italy, Germany, France and the US in addition to the UK, Russia and Ukraine.  Andrei Barysevich, a spokesman for security firm Recorded Future, told the BBC such attacks would not stop because cyber-thieves found them too lucrative.  ""A  South Korean hosting firm  just paid $1m to get their data back and that's a huge incentive,"" he said. ""It's the biggest incentive you could offer to a cyber-criminal.""

Also included are initialisms used on the online parenting forum Mumsnet such as TTC - meaning trying to conceive. OED senior editor Fi Mooring said the words chosen will resonate ""even with people who are not parents"". The dictionary consults experts to determine what should be added to its 829,000 words. The OED is updated four times a year with the next update due in April 2018. What's new? TTC - trying to conceive BFN/ BFP - big fat negative/ big fat positive (related to the results of a pregnancy test) CIO - cry it out Hangry - bad-tempered or irritable as a result of hunger Hazzle - to dry in open air Lactivism - advocating in favour of breast-feeding, rather than bottle-feeding Tomgirl - a girl or woman who acts or dresses in a manner conventionally more associated with boys Geg - Liverpudlian slang for intruding or joining in uninvited Masstige - a combination of the words masses and prestige referring to cheap products marketed as luxurious  Mansplaining is defined as explaining something ""needlessly, overbearingly, or condescendingly, especially to a woman, in a manner thought to reveal a patronising or chauvinistic attitude"". Researchers date early usage of that term to an internet exchange between a man and a woman in 2008.  Although hangry has only come into common usage recently the word dates back to 1956 when it appeared in a psychoanalytic journal. The OED defines the new term snowflake as a description of someone who is ""overly sensitive or as feeling entitled to special treatment or consideration"". Ransomware is another new addition - less than a year since the NHS was one of a number of global institutions targeted by the  WannaCry cyber attack  that was carried out with the use of malicious software. Chaebol is formed by combining the Korean words chae, meaning wealth, and bol, meaning faction and, in South Korea, means a large business conglomerate. However, recently the word has been used to describe a luxurious lifestyle associated with families who own such businesses.

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-41076591|"Ransomware behind NHS Lanarkshire cyber-attack Published 28 August 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Ross Watson image caption Services at major sites such as Wishaw General Hospital were disrupted by the cyber-attack It has been confirmed that ransomware was behind a cyber-attack on a Scottish health board which led to some appointments and procedures being cancelled.  NHS Lanarkshire said it was a new variant of Bitpaymer that infected its network on Friday. The board said staff worked over the weekend to reinstate IT systems. Work is ongoing to establish how the malware was able to infiltrate the network without being detected. The cyber-attack started on Friday . Operations were cancelled and the work of GPs was disrupted. Analysis from Zoe Kleinman, technology reporter, BBC News Ransomware is a particularly destructive form of malware that catastrophically struck the NHS earlier this year. While this new infection is not the notorious Wannacry variation, which caused global chaos, it is yet another demonstration of how disruptive ransomware can be. What it does is encrypt the data it finds on a host computer so that it can no longer be accessed, and then demands payment, often in Bitcoin, for its release. Experts recommend resorting to back-up files rather than paying the ransom itself as there's no guarantee that the criminals behind it will keep to their word - but there are many examples of cases where individuals and organisations have chosen to part with their cash. Most malware travels via phishing emails - something that looks like it's from a trusted source and asks the recipient to click a link. It only takes a moment of being caught off-guard to be taken in.  The best defence is to keep software updated and use anti-virus protection but it can be difficult for large organisations like the NHS to implement this en-masse, when complicated, life-saving equipment is running off a network that may not adjust well to even minor tweaks. NHS Lanarkshire chief executive Calum Campbell said: ""We quickly identified the source of the malware and investigations are ongoing as to how this was able to infiltrate our network. ""Our staff have worked hard to minimise the impact on patients and our contingency plans have ensured we have been able to continue to deliver services while the IT issues were resolved. A small number of systems were affected with the majority restored over the weekend and the remainder on Monday."" ""Unfortunately a small number of procedures and appointments were cancelled as a result of the incident. I would like to apologise to anyone who has been affected by this disruption. We immediately started work to reappoint patients to the earliest possible appointments."" media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The health board said it was working with its IT security providers to establish how the malware had infiltrated the network. A spokesman added: ""Our security software and systems were up to date with the latest signature files, but as this was a new malware variant the latest security software was unable to detect it.  ""Following analysis of the malware our security providers issued an updated signature so that this variant can now be detected and blocked.""

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-41753022|"NHS 'could have prevented' WannaCry ransomware attack Published 27 October 2017 comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption WannaCry was the biggest cyber-attack that has affected the NHS to date NHS trusts were left vulnerable in a major  ransomware  attack in May because cyber-security recommendations were not followed, a government report has said. More than a third of trusts in England were disrupted by the WannaCry ransomware, according to the National Audit Office (NAO). At least 6,900 NHS appointments were cancelled as a result of the attack. NHS England said no patient data had been compromised or stolen and praised the staff response. The NAO chief said the Department of Health and the NHS must now ""get their act together"". Cyber-attack: Your questions answered WannaCry: What can you do to protect your business? Malware, patches and worms defined WannaCry, which spread to more than 150 countries in a worldwide ransomware outbreak beginning on 12 May, was  the biggest cyber-attack to have hit the NHS  to date. The malware encrypted data on infected computers and demanded a ransom roughly equivalent to Â£230 ($300). The  NAO report  said there was no evidence that any NHS organisation paid the ransom - but the financial cost of the incident remained unknown. An assessment of 88 out of 236 trusts by NHS Digital before the attack found that none passed the required cyber-security standards. image copyright Getty Images image caption As a result of disruption caused by WannaCry, patients were turned away from appointments The report said NHS trusts had not acted on critical alerts from NHS Digital and a warning from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office in 2014 to patch or migrate away from vulnerable older software. The Department of Health also lacked important information, the report said. ""Before 12 May 2017, the department had no formal mechanism for assessing whether NHS organisations had complied with its advice and guidance."" Organisations could also have better managed their computers' firewalls - but in many cases they did not, it said. NHS organisations have not reported any cases of harm to patients or of their data being stolen as a result of WannaCry. NHS England has identified 6,912 appointments - including operations - that were cancelled as a direct result of the ransomware. But it estimated that about 19,000 appointments in total may have been affected. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Cases included at least 139 people potentially with cancer, who had urgent referrals cancelled.  It is not known:  how many GP appointments were cancelled how many ambulances and individuals were diverted from five accident and emergency departments unable to treat some patients how many trusts or GPs experienced delays in information, such as test results The NAO credits the widely reported work of cyber-security researcher Marcus Hutchins, who accidentally helped to stop the spread of WannaCry. His ""kill switch""  involved registering a domain name  linked to the malware, which deactivated the program's ability to spread automatically. media caption LISTEN: How 'Malware Tech' became an 'accidental hero' Home Office Minister Ben Wallace told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government was ""as sure as possible"" that North Korea was behind the attack. ""This attack, we believe quite strongly that it came from a foreign state,"" he said. ""It is widely believed in the community and across a number of countries that North Korea [took on] this role"". Speaking on the same programme, former chairman of NHS Digital, Kingsley Manning, said that a failure to upgrade old computer systems at a local level within the NHS had contributed to the rapid spread of the malware. He said: ""The problem with cyber security for the NHS is [that] it has a particular vulnerability... It's very interconnected so if you get an attack in one place it tends to spread."" Mr Manning blamed a lack of time and resources but also ""frankly a lack of focus, a lack of taking it seriously"" for individual NHS organisations' failure to keep up with cyber-security improvements. ""This was an extremely unsophisticated attack,"" he added.  The NAO said the NHS ""has accepted that there are lessons to learn"" from WannaCry and will now develop a response plan. It will also ensure that critical cyber-security updates - such as applying software patches - are carried out by IT staff, the NAO said. WannaCry was ""a relatively unsophisticated attack and could have been prevented by the NHS following basic IT security best practice,"" said Sir Amyas Morse, comptroller and auditor-general of the NAO. ""There are more sophisticated cyber-threats out there than WannaCry so the Department and the NHS need to get their act together to ensure the NHS is better protected against future attacks."" Keith McNeil, NHS chief clinical information officer for health and care, said: ""As the NAO report makes clear, no harm was caused to patients and there were no incidents of patient data being compromised or stolen. ""Tried and tested emergency plans were activated quickly and our hard-working NHS staff went the extra mile to provide patient care, keeping the impact on NHS services and patients to a minimum."" image copyright EPA Analysis - by Rory Cellan-Jones, technology correspondent For many executives, a serious cyber-attack is now very high on their list of risks to their organisations and a priority for disaster planning. So what is most shocking in this report is the lack of planning at a local level in the NHS for such an event.  To be fair, the Department of Health had developed a plan - it was just that it had not been properly communicated or tested in the NHS trusts. When disaster struck, nobody seemed to know who was in charge or what to do. Of course, all of this could have been avoided if security patches had been applied to protect the Windows 7 systems common throughout the NHS. Once again, there had been warnings sent out by NHS Digital, but many trusts failed to act upon them - though in that they were no different from many organisations around the world that were also hit. In one way, the NHS was lucky - if, instead of a Friday in May, the attack had taken place on a Monday in winter, with a week's appointments affected, the damage would have been far worse. Cyber-security experts will tell you that dealing with attacks like these is mostly a management rather than a technology problem. And in this case the NHS proved itself incapable of managing a speedy and effective response to its first major cyber-security crisis.

The malware has affected systems at three Russian websites, an airport in Ukraine and an underground railway in the capital city, Kiev. The cyber-police chief in Ukraine confirmed to the Reuters news agency that Bad Rabbit was the ransomware in question. It bears similarities to the WannaCry and Petya outbreaks earlier this year. However, it is not yet known how far this new malware will be able to spread. ""In some of the companies, the work has been completely paralysed - servers and workstations are encrypted,"" head of Russian cyber-security firm Group-IB, Ilya Sachkov, told the TASS news agency. Two of the affected sites are Interfax and Fontanka.ru. Meanwhile, US officials said they had ""received multiple reports of Bad Rabbit ransomware infections in many countries around the world"". The US computer emergency readiness team said it ""discourages individuals and organisations from paying the ransom, as this does not guarantee that access will be restored"".  Who was affected? By Ksenia Idrisova and Yaroslava Kiryukhina, BBC Monitoring Initial news reports mentioned Russian media websites, such as St Petersburg-based Fontanka.ru, as well as an airport in Ukraine's Odessa and a subway system in Kiev.  Privately-owned Russian news agency Interfax was hit particularly hard, to the extent that 24 hours later its website still displayed a message reading ""our service is temporary unavailable"". On the morning of 25 October, it transpired that Russian banks had also been targeted but, luckily, were not compromised.  The Russian Central Bank said in a statement that it had recorded a BadRabbit attack on Russian financial institutions, but that none of them had been compromised, as reported by RNS news agency on 25 October. Otkrytiye, formerly Russia's biggest privately-owned bank, was one of the Russian financial institutions that repelled the attack, according to RNS.  Prominent Russian IT security firm Group-IB reported that BadRabbit had targeted several of the top 20 Russian banks but failed to penetrate their networks. Russia hit most ""According to our data, most of the victims targeted by these attacks are located in Russia,"" said Vyacheslav Zakorzhevsky at Kaspersky Lab. ""We have also seen similar but fewer attacks in Ukraine, Turkey and Germany."" Bad Rabbit encrypts the contents of a computer and asks for a payment - in this case 0.05 bitcoins, or about $280 (Â£213). Cyber-security firms, including Russia-based Kaspersky, have said they are monitoring the attack. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The malware is still undetected by the majority of anti-virus programs,  according to analysis by virus checking site Virus Total . One security firm, Eset, has said that the malware was  distributed via a bogus  Adobe Flash update. Researcher Kevin Beaumont has  posted a screenshot  that shows Bad Rabbit creating tasks in Windows named after the dragons Drogon and Rhaegal in TV series Game of Thrones. The outbreak bears similarities to the  WannaCry  and  Petya  ransomware outbreaks that spread around the world causing widespread disruption earlier this year.

The university describes it as a ""ransomware"" attack, such as last month's cyber-attack which threatened NHS computer systems. The attack was continuing on Thursday, with access to online networks being restricted. The university has warned staff and students of the risk of data loss and ""very substantial disruption"". University College London (UCL) is a ""centre of excellence in cyber-security research"", a status awarded by the GCHQ intelligence and monitoring service. The central London university, ranked last week in the world's top 10, says that a ""widespread ransomware attack"" began on Wednesday. It was first blamed on so-called ""phishing"" emails, with links to destructive software.  But later the university suggested it was more likely to be from contact with a ""compromised"" website, where clicking on a pop-up page might have spread a malware infection. NHS attack Ransomware attacks are where computer systems are locked and threatened with damaging software unless payments are made. Students and staff were warned that ""ransomware damages files on your computer and on shared drives where you save files"" and were told not to open any suspicious attachments. The university says that it believes the risk of further infection has been contained, but it is urging staff and students to help with efforts to reduce any ""further spread of this malware"". Universities, which often carry out commercially sensitive research, have become frequent targets for cyber-attacks. ""However, what makes this attack interesting is the timing,"" said Graham Rymer, an ethical hacker and research associate at the University of Cambridge. ""Hackers tend to target people who will be desperate to get access to their data and are, therefore, more likely to pay the ransom. ""Currently there are a lot of students who will be putting the final touches to their dissertations, so it could be that they were the targets."" Mr Rymer said UCL seemed to have responded well to the attack and had ""locked it down pretty well"". ""One thing UCL did is to quickly switch all drives in the system to ""read-only"" following the attack, which essentially prevented the malware from doing real damage.""  Mr Rymer said UCL may not have been the only intended target as he had seen other businesses facing the same malware. Last month, the  National Health Service in England and Scotland was subject to a significant ransomware cyber-attack , as part of a global wave of attacks.

He told the BBC the act was ""unprecedented in its scale"" and warned more people could find themselves affected on Monday morning. The virus took control of users' files, demanding payments; Russia and the UK were among the worst-hit countries. Experts say another attack could be imminent and have warned people to ensure their security is up to date. Mr Wainwright said that the ransomware - software that blocks access to data until a ransom is paid - was combined with a worm application - a program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers. This, he said, was allowing the ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"".  He added: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time."" 'Patch before Monday' Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the ransomware, he said. Companies need to make sure they have updated their systems and ""patched where they should"" before staff arrived for work on Monday morning, the EU law enforcement agency head said.  In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, GP surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected. media caption Europol director Rob Wainwright warned that companies must patch their systems before Monday morning What occurred was an ""indiscriminate attack across the world on multiple industries and services"", Mr Wainwright said, including Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry.

The virus exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft Windows software, first identified by the US National Security Agency, experts have said.  After taking computers over, it displayed messages demanding a payment of $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock files and return them to the user.  Microsoft released security updates last month to address the vulnerability, with another patch  released on Friday . The UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"".  MalwareTech, who wants to remain anonymous, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it.

It has been nearly three months since infections struck organisations worldwide, including the NHS, which faced days of disruption as a result. The bitcoin activity was noticed by  a Twitter bot  set up by Quartz journalist Keith Collins. The balance of all wallets known to be associated with WannaCry is now zero. The ransomware hit many businesses hard, quickly infecting multiple computers on corporate networks and encrypting them so they became useless. Victims were asked to pay between $300 and $600 to get their systems back. Back in May, many  cyber-security experts and law enforcement agencies advised victims  that paying the ransom would probably only encourage other cyber-criminals and not result in restored access to computers. However, many clearly decided to take a chance. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? According to bitcoin-monitoring company Elliptic, an initial portion of the WannaCry funds  were moved in late July . And at about 04:10 BST on Thursday, the vast majority were finally withdrawn in entirety. Many watchers expect that the WannaCry bitcoins will be put through a ""mixer"" - in which the currency is transferred and mixed into a larger series of payments that make it much harder to track where it ends up. But the incident has left some cyber-security experts confused. ""I have no idea why they would move that money to be honest,"" said Andy Patel at F-Secure. ""I wouldn't imagine that they are going to try and turn those bitcoins into real money. If they do, it's going to give someone a way to track them to an actual person."" Instead, Mr Patel told the BBC the funds could be used to pay for dark web services that might leave less of a digital paper trail. In July, bitcoins paid as ransom following a separate attack - NotPetya - were moved from their online wallets. Analysis image copyright Getty Images By Alan Woodward, cyber-security adviser to Europol Many people assume Bitcoin is anonymous: the online equivalent of cash. However, every transaction is completely visible to anyone who cares to look.   There are even online sites that allow you to view what is happening in the blockchain - the distributed ledger that records all bitcoin movements. The blockchain is more like a Swiss bank account: you know the account number and which account transfers money to which other accounts, but you don't necessarily know who stands behind that account number.  A technique called ""cluster analysis"" looks across all of these bitcoin addresses and attempts to find addresses that are being used by the same people.  Then, some of the other transactions in that cluster, which were not intended to be anonymous, can provide evidence of who owns those addresses. Law enforcement agencies often use this classic approach to track criminals - the idea, of course, is: ""Follow the money."" Alan Woodward is professor of cyber-security at the University of Surrey.

The search giant created thousands of virtual victims of ransomware to expose the payment ecosystem surrounding the malware type. Most of the money was made in 2016 as gangs realised how lucrative it was, revealed a talk at Black Hat.  Two types of ransomware made most of the money, it said, but other variants are starting to emerge.  Track and trace ""It's become a very, very profitable market and is here to stay,"" said Elie Bursztein from Google who, along with colleagues Kylie McRoberts and Luca Invernizzi, carried out the research.   Ransomware is malicious software that infects a machine and then encrypts or scrambles files so they can no longer be used or read. The files are only decrypted when a victim pays a ransom. Payments typically have to be made using the Bitcoin virtual currency.  Mr Bursztein said Google used several different methods to work out how much cash was flowing towards ransomware creators. As well as drawing on reports from people who had paid a ransom, it sought out the files used to infect machines and then ran those on lots of virtual machines to generate ""synthetic victims"", he said.  Cyber-hacks season: Cyber-security industry 'lacks empathy' claims Facebook The myth of the âsophisticatedâ hacker Hiding out among the net's criminal class Cyber-crooks put into rehab camp It then monitored the network traffic generated by these victims to work out to where money would be transferred. The data gathered in this stage was also used to find more variants of ransomware and the 300,000 files it found broke down into 34 of them, he said. The most popular strains were the Locky and Cerber families, added Mr Bursztein. Payment analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain, which logs all transactions made using the e-currency, revealed that those two strains also made the most money over the last year, he said, with Locky collecting about $7.8m (Â£5.9m) and Cerber $6.9m (Â£5.2m). The research project also revealed where the cash flowed and accumulated in the Bitcoin network and where it was converted back into cash. More than 95% of Bitcoin payments for ransomware  were cashed out via Russia's BTC-e exchange, found Google.  On 26 July, one of the founders of BTC-e, Alexander Vinnik, was arrested by Greek police on money laundering charges. The police were acting on a US warrant and his extradition to America is being sought.  The gangs behind the ransomware explosion were not likely to stop soon, said Mr Bursztein, although established strains are facing competition from newer ones.  ""Ransomware is a fast-moving market,"" he said. ""There's aggressive competition coming from variants such as SamSam and Spora."" Novel variants were expanding quickly and many were encouraging fast expansion by paying affiliates more if they placed the malware on to large numbers of machines. The ransomware as a service model was already proving popular, he warned. ""It's no longer a game reserved for tech-savvy criminals,"" he said. ""It's for almost anyone.""

In total there were 723 incidents of all kinds, marking close to a 10% rise on the previous period. Of those, 194 were Covid-related. Some of the incidents related to countering nation-state attacks, but most were criminal in nature, the GCHQ division reported. It also disclosed that it had thwarted 15,354 campaigns that had used coronavirus themes as a ""lure"" to fool people into clicking on a link or opening an attachment containing malicious software. Some involved fake shops selling PPE (personal protective equipment), test kits and even vaccines. Vaccine hackers Protecting the NHS and health-related research has been a priority, the report said..  In July, the UK accused Russia  of trying to steal vaccine-related information  through cyber-espionage.  And officials said they had continued to see an ""ongoing threat"" of states targeting the vaccine research-and-delivery programme.  The NCSC said it had scanned more than one million NHS IP (internet protocol) addresses to look for vulnerabilities, and had shared 51,000 indicators of compromise.  It has also carried out ""threat hunting"" to look for security risks on connected devices, and worked on the security of the NHS Covid-19 contact-tracing app. Aggressive ransomware attacks The NCSC also warned ransomware attacks had become more common. Ransomware locks people out of their computers and demands victims make a blackmail payment to restore access - and even then it is not always granted. The NCSC said it had handled more than three times as many ransomware incidents as in the previous year. These included an attack against Redcar and Cleveland Council which, the officials said, had ""caused considerable damage and disruption"".  The report added the NCSC had observed a growing trend for such attacks to be more targeted and aggressive than previously. Rather than just locking people out of access to their data until a ransom was paid, attackers often warned they would embarrass victims if they refused to comply. ""We have seen the threat of data being leaked,"" Paul Chichester, director of operations, told the BBC. Examples included details of staff salaries being published online. This meant victims were at risk even if they have backed up their data.  However, the NCSC said the UK did not appear to be as heavily targeted as some countries, because British victims were less likely to pay the attackers. Punch-tape replacement The NCSC has also been working to increase skills and diversity in the cyber-security industry.  It said almost 12,000 girls had taken part in its 2020 competition. However, an advert for the government's related CyberFirst campaign  was widely criticised last month for featuring a ballerina  and the slogan ""Fatima's next job could be in cyber"". image copyright Cyber First/UK Government  image caption NCSC has said it was not involved in the creation of the CyberFirst poster The report also highlighted the agency's role in protecting parliament as it became ""virtual"" to prevent hacking of debates or votes.  And it revealed that the NCSC had just updated the system for producing cryptographic keys, which encrypt classified government and military systems.  A new electronic system was introduced to replace old-fashioned punch-tape.

A pop-up screen accused the phone owner of accessing illegal pornography or pirating music and could not be removed. However the ransomware was fake - and clearing the browser cache was actually enough to restore full access. It ran on JavaScript, a code commonly employed by many websites. The attackers demanded Â£100 in the form of an iTunes gift card with the code sent via text message to a designated mobile number, said security firm Lookout in a blog about the malware. ""...the attack doesn't actually encrypt any data and hold it ransom,""  wrote its security researchers . ""Its purpose is to scare the victim into paying to unlock the browser before he realizes he doesn't have to pay the ransom to recover data or access the browser."" The patch closed the loophole but Professor Alan Woodward, cybersecurity expert at Surrey University said some iPhone users have put off the update because it also includes other changes to the running of the device.  ""Some people have held off thinking it sounds fairly major, but obviously if they do that they won't get the protection,"" he said. ""There is this feeling that iOS [Apple's operating system] and Apple devices in general are less vulnerable.  ""This shines a light on the fact that nothing is invulnerable.

ransomware|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39926855|"WannaCry ransomware cyber-attack: Your questions answered Published 16 May 2017 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images After a cyber-attack disrupted IT services across the globe, many people have written to the BBC with questions about why it happened, how you can protect your computers and smartphones, and if the attackers will be caught. BBC Technology reporter Chris Foxx and security expert Prof Alan Woodward provide some answers. WannaCry ransomware cyber-attacks slow but fears remain Why doesn't the NHS used a closed secure network, like the military? ""Practically speaking, it's not possible to completely isolate the NHS network,"" said cyber-security expert Prof Alan Woodward. ""The NHS sends emails to patients who have email addresses outside of the NHS network.  ""People in the NHS also use the internet heavily for research, just like academics."" Even a private network can be compromised, especially in an organisation with thousands of people using it daily.  ""Once [a virus] has managed to enter the larger network, it can then use vulnerabilities to spread,"" said Prof Woodward. Will banks and personal finances be affected? Since serving customers online is now part of banks' bread and butter, you would expect cyber-security to be at the very top of their priorities.  Cyber-security is a game of cat and mouse, with criminals always thinking of new ways to attack systems, so no organisation is totally impenetrable.  This ransomware outbreak is mostly likely to affect your finances if you get infected and pay the ransom, which security experts say you should not do.  There is absolutely no guarantee the criminals would give your files back. If you run a business, there is detailed guidance on the  National Cyber Security Centre website  you can follow to make sure your company is protected. How the cyber-attack can be traced to the US Should you pay the WannaCry ransom? Is my computer at risk? How can I personally protect my device from ransomware? Microsoft has already identified the way this specific strain of ransomware spread from device to device, and has issued a  issued a fix .  As long as your operating system is up-to-date, you should be protected from this strain of ransomware.  Always make sure you are running the latest version of your operating system with the latest security fixes installed - and run up-to-date anti-virus software from a trusted company. Although this strain of ransomware was not spread by email, always beware suspicious emails asking you to click links or download attachments. Criminals will often use a widely publicised virus outbreak to send scam emails, pretending to offer help.  To prevent heartbreak, if the worst comes to the worst you should keep a backup copy of important files, photos and videos on an external hard drive.   Make sure to disconnect the drive from your computer after making your backup, so ransomware can't access it if your computer is infected. ""The bottom line is that all you can really do is keep your software, including your virus checker, up to date. Ideally have updates set to automatic,"" said Prof Woodward. Why are the attackers doing this? The purpose of a ransomware attack is to extort money from victims.  It is a powerful attack because people may fear losing their documents and photographs and so may be more likely to pay.  When it hits businesses and hospitals, there is extra pressure to get rid of the ransomware quickly.  The government has said the ransomware outbreak at the NHS was not a targeted attack on the UK's health service.  It may be that the attackers created their virus without knowing exactly how far it would spread.  Do you have to open an email attachment to be infected? No. This strain of ransomware was spread from device to device by taking advantage of an old security hole in some versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system.  The hole is fixed in the latest versions of Windows.  image copyright PA However, ransomware can be spread in rogue email attachments, so do not click links or open attachments in unsolicited emails. ""Practice ABC - assume nothing, believe no-one, check everything,"" says Prof Woodward. Are there potential cyber-attacks that can affect other operating systems? Yes, every operating system could theoretically be attacked. Criminals tend to target systems such as Windows or the Android mobile operating system, because they are more widely used, increasing the chance of people falling victim.  Will the people behind the ransomware be caught? In the same way that a burglar breaking into a home can cover their tracks, cyber-criminals can go to great lengths to hide their identity. However, many cyber-criminals have been caught and brought to justice - and the UK's National Crime Agency, Europol and the FBI are already investigating.

ransomware|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-39917278|"Ransomware and the NHS - the inquest begins Rory Cellan-Jones Technology correspondent @BBCRoryCJ on Twitter Published 15 May 2017 comments Comments Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright EPA We now know that Friday's ransomware attack was a global cybercrime, hitting organisations ranging from the Russian Interior Ministry to the delivery firm Fedex. But the most serious impact was here in the UK on the National Health Service. So what made our hospitals so vulnerable? There are plenty of theories - among them that far too many computers in hospitals were running Windows XP.  Microsoft stopped supporting this now quite ancient operating system back in 2014, leaving it vulnerable to attacks (although the company took the unusual step over the weekend of rushing out a patch to deal with the Wannacry threat). The government warned NHS trusts in 2014 that they needed to move away from XP as rapidly as possible. A letter from the Cabinet Office  told them there would be some temporary help with security for old equipment until April 2015, but after that they were on their own. ""It is therefore essential that all NHS organisations put in place robust plans to migrate away from Windows XP, Office 2003 and Exchange 2003 by that date if you have not already done so,"" the letter said. But did they? At the end of last year the software firm Citrix said that a Freedom of Information request had revealed that 90% of hospitals still had machines running on Windows XP. Now, while that is extremely worrying, it paints an exaggerated picture. IT professionals in the health service tell me that while many hospitals may have a few computers - or perhaps some key medical equipment - dependent on XP those devices would not usually be connected to the internet.  They believe that the more likely explanation dates back to March this year when Microsoft issued a security update for its more recent versions of Windows. It was designed to deal with a vulnerability in something called Server Message Block, which is a protocol for sharing files across a network. We now know that Friday's attack made use of this vulnerability, so hospitals which did not apply that patch were leaving themselves open to attack. So why would they have failed to act? Well, many organisations take time to apply updates, wanting to be sure that there are no compatibility problems with other software applications. Hospitals often have a wide and somewhat chaotic collection of software, some of which will be very old but still seen as vital by those who use it. image copyright PA But Dr Joe McDonald, who runs what he describes as a network of geeky doctors and nurses, identifies some other issues.  He explains that since the collapse of the disastrous NHS National Programme for IT there is no longer a centralised approach to things like updates - each trust goes its own way.  He says his area is systematic about keeping systems up to date - but for others, cost is a big issue. ""There is a real squeeze on spending - and IT security isn't seen as sexy compared to things like incubators and kidney machines,"" he says.  The fact that so many Windows XP computers are still allowed in hospitals is a reflection of the low priority given to spending on robust IT. What we now need to understand is what those NHS organisations which were affected by the ransomware have in common, and how they differ from those which escaped unscathed.   This attack does not appear to have been targeted at hospitals. In fact, security expert Professor Alan Woodward says it may have been an experiment by some relatively inexperienced hackers that took off in a way they didn't expect.  But the NHS will now need to think long and hard about whether it can afford to make cybersecurity such a low priority.

Criminals broke into the systems of 17 libraries, disabled them and demanded a ransom. It meant people were unable to borrow books or use the computers. All services were being restored, said Waller McGuire, executive director of St Louis libraries, on Tuesday. No ransom has been paid to the attackers. According to Intel Security, ransomware attacks are rising in ""alarming"" numbers.

One is ransomware that encrypts data and demands payment before files are released. The other is spyware that watches what users do and scoops up valuable information. Experts said they represented a threat because their creators were letting anyone use them for free. The two programs were uncovered by the security firms Fortinet and AlienVault, which found a portal on the Tor ""dark web"" network that acted as a shopfront for both. In a blog,  Fortinet said the site claimed  that the creators behind it were professional software engineers with ""extensive experience"" of creating working code. Those wishing to use either of the programs had been urged to get in touch and provide details of how they wanted the malware to be set up. The malware's creators had said that payments made by ransomware victims would be split between themselves and their customers. Researchers at Fortinet contacted the ransomware writers pretending they were interested in using the product and, soon afterwards, were sent a sample of the malware. Analysis revealed that it used much less sophisticated encryption than the many variants seen targeting Windows machines, said the firm. image copyright Reuters image caption NHS computers were hit by a high-profile ransomware attack last month However, they added, any files scrambled with the ransomware would be completely lost because it did a very poor job of handling the decryption keys needed to restore data. ""Even if it is far inferior to most current ransomware targeting Windows, it doesn't fail to encrypt victim's files or prevent access to important files, thereby causing real damage,"" wrote the researchers. The free Macspy spyware, offered via the same site, can log which keys are pressed, take screenshots and tap into a machine's microphone.  In its analysis, AlienVault researcher Peter Ewane  said the malicious code  in the spyware tried hard to evade many of the standard ways security programs spot and stop such programs. Mr Ewane said Mac users needed to start being more vigilant as malware creators targeted them. ""As OS X continues to grow in market share we can expect malware authors to invest greater amounts of time in producing malware for this platform."" Statistics gathered by McAfee  suggest that there are now about 450,000 malicious programs aimed at Macs - far fewer than the 23 million targeting Windows users. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Aamir Lakhani from Fortinet said Mac users should make sure their machines were kept up to date with the latest software patches and be wary of messages they receive via email. ""Mac ransomware is definitely becoming bigger,""  he told EWeek . ""Although market share is still small, hackers know that there is valuable data on the Mac.""

A spokesperson for police agency Europol said the situation in Europe ""seems stable"". In Asia, where many offices closed before the WannaCry ransomware struck on Friday, the attack has been less severe than expected. The ransomware takes over users' files, demanding $300 (Â£230) to restore them. The White House said on Monday that under $70,000 (Â£54,000) had been paid in total in a bid to get any locked data released. Payments could go up as the ransomware warned the cost would double after three days, and threatened to delete files within seven days if no payment was made. Your questions answered Who might be behind the attack? What are malware, patches and worms? Computer giant Microsoft said the attack, which has affected hundreds of thousands of computers, should serve as a wake-up call. Among the organisations targeted worldwide have been Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's interior ministry. What was the situation on Monday? Many firms employed experts over the weekend to try to prevent new infections. Senior spokesman for Europol, Jan Op Gen Oorth, told the AFP news agency: ""The number of victims appears not to have gone up and so far the situation seems stable in Europe, which is a success. ""It seems that a lot of internet security guys over the weekend did their homework and ran the security software updates."" UK Health Minister Jeremy Hunt  confirmed to the BBC  that UK intelligence services had found no evidence of a second wave of attacks on Monday. The  badly affected National Health Service  said seven out of 47 trusts that were hit were still facing serious issues. Should you pay the ransom? Is my computer at risk?

Russian President Vladimir Putin said: ""Russia has absolutely nothing to do with it."" EU Commissioner for Security Julian King told the BBC on Monday that the EU was proposing legislation to reinforce cyber security in the wake of the attack. Some private sector security researchers say they have seen some similarities between some of the code in the recent attack and some linked to North Korea in the past.  Security officials in the UK, however, say they have not seen anything they would regard as hard evidence, Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, reports. Should people pay? Companies in Asia and Europe have been warning employees to be careful when clicking on attachments and links in their emails.

Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, also said it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against.

Indonesia hospital The communication and information ministry said the malware locked patient files on computers at two hospitals in the capital Jakarta. Patients at the Dharmais Cancer Hospital could not get queue numbers and waited several hours while staff found paper records, local media reported. India state police Police computer systems in the state of Andhra Pradesh have been hit, local media reports say. About 18 systems were hijacked an eventually disabled, the Business Standard  reported . Several companies in the cities of Mumbai, Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Chennai were also affected. However India has said that its vital computer systems largely escaped unscathed because the state organisation that manages almost all government websites installed patches to immunise its Windows systems. The Economic Times newspaper had  said  India could be particularly vulnerable to the malware because a large number of organisations and individuals use old outdated versions of Windows and there are also high numbers of people using pirated software. UK hospitals Some of the biggest disruption was caused by attacks on the UK health system, which saw hospitals and clinics forced to turn away patients after losing access to computers. Pictures on social media showed NHS computer screens with messages saying: ""Ooops, your files have been encrypted!"" In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected. A Nissan car factory in the north-eastern city of Sunderland was also affected, a spokeswoman said. Spanish telecoms The Spanish telephone operator Telefonica said it had been attacked. Telefonica's head of cyber-security Chema Alonso - himself a former hacker - said the infected equipment was ""under control and being reinstalled"". Other Spanish firms to be hit included power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural. Staff were reportedly told to turn off their computers.     France Renault The car manufacturer had to halt production at many sites, including in France, Slovenia and Romania, as part of measures to stop the spread of the virus.  On Monday the firm said that 90% of its factories were running again. It said its plant at Douai in northern France would be back to normal on Tuesday, following checks. Renault would be able to catch up with any lost production so customers would not be affected, it added.

Cyber-security firm Avast said it had seen 75,000 cases of the ransomware - known as WannaCry and variants of that name - around the world. There are reports of infections in 99 countries, including Russia and China. Among the worst hit was the National Health Service (NHS) in England and Scotland. The BBC understands  about 40 NHS organisations and some medical practices  were hit, with operations and appointments cancelled. media caption NHS cyber attack: ""My heart surgery was cancelled"" How did the cyber-attack unfold? The malware spread quickly on Friday, with medical staff in the UK reportedly seeing computers go down ""one by one"".  NHS staff shared screenshots of the WannaCry program, which demanded a payment of $300 (Â£230) in virtual currency Bitcoin to unlock the files for each computer. Throughout the day other, mainly European countries, reported infections. Some reports said  Russia  had seen more infections than any other single country. Domestic banks, the interior and health ministries, the state-owned Russian railway firm and the second largest mobile phone network were all reported to have been hit. Russia's interior ministry said 1,000 of its computers had been infected but the virus was swiftly dealt with and no sensitive data was compromised. In  Spain , a number of large firms - including telecoms giant Telefonica, power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural - were also hit, with reports that staff at the firms were told to turn off their computers. People tweeted photos of affected computers including a  local railway ticket machine  in  Germany  and a  university computer lab  in  Italy . France's  car-maker Renault,  Portugal  Telecom, the  US  delivery company FedEx and a local authority in  Sweden  were also affected. China  has not officially commented on any attacks it may have suffered, but comments on social media said a university computer lab had been compromised.

Coincidentally, finance ministers from the Group of Seven wealthiest countries have been meeting in Italy to discuss the threat of cyber-attacks on the global financial system. They are expected to release a statement later in which they pledge greater co-operation in the fight against cyber-crime, including spotting potential vulnerabilities and assessing security measures. media caption The BBC's Rory Cellan Jones explains how Bitcoin works How does the malware work and who is behind it? The infections seem to be deployed via a worm - a program that spreads by itself between computers. Most other malicious programs rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code. By contrast, once WannaCry is inside an organisation it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too.  Some experts say the attack may have been built to exploit a weakness in Microsoft systems that had been identified by the NSA and given the name EternalBlue. The NSA tools were stolen by a group of hackers known as The Shadow Brokers, who made  it freely available  in April, saying it was a ""protest"" about US President Donald Trump. At the time, some cyber-security experts said some of the malware was real, but old. A patch for the vulnerability was released by Microsoft in March, which would have automatically protected those computers with Windows Update enabled. Microsoft  said on Friday  it would roll out the update to users of older operating systems ""that no longer receive mainstream support"", such Windows XP (which the NHS still largely uses), Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The number of infections seems to be slowing after a ""kill switch"" appears to have been accidentally triggered by a UK-based cyber-security researcher tweeting as  @MalwareTechBlog . He was  quoted as saying  he noticed the web address the virus was searching for had not been registered - and when he registered it, the virus appeared to stop spreading. But he warned this was a temporary fix, and urged computers users to ""patch your systems ASAP"". Why do companies still use Windows XP? By Chris Foxx, technology reporter Many jobs can be done using software everyone can buy, but some businesses need programs that perform very specific jobs - so they build their own.  For example. a broadcaster might need specialist software to track all the satellite feeds coming into the newsroom, and a hospital might need custom-built tools to analyse X-ray images. Developing niche but useful software like this can be very expensive - the programming, testing, maintenance and continued development all adds up.   Then along comes a new version of Windows, and the software isn't compatible. Companies then face the cost of upgrading computers and operating system licenses, as well as the cost of rebuilding their software from scratch. So, some choose to keep running the old version of Windows instead. For some companies, that is not a huge risk. In a hospital, the stakes are higher.

If the ransom remains unpaid, it continues deleting random files every six hours. The Stampado malware is for sale for less than $50 for a lifetime's licence. Unlike other variants, it does not need administrator rights to start infecting computers. Ransomware is malicious software that scrambles the data on a victim's PC and then asks for payment before restoring the data to its original state.  The costs of unlocking data vary, with individuals typically paying a few hundred pounds and businesses a few thousand.

Scientists at the University of Florida (UF) say they have developed software that can stop the growing problem of ransomware in its tracks. Ransomware encrypts computer files and is used by hackers who then demand money in exchange for freeing the content. It is becoming a huge problem globally. The solution - dubbed CryptoDrop - detected the malware and stopped it after it had encrypted just a handful of files, said its developers. Patrick Traynor, an associate professor in UF's department of computer and information science, worked with PhD student Nolen Scaife and Henry Carter, from Villanova University, on the software. ""Our system is more of an early-warning system,"" Mr Scaife said. ""It doesn't prevent the ransomware from starting... it prevents the ransomware from completing its taskâ¦ so you lose only a couple of pictures or a couple of documents rather than everything that's on your hard drive, and it relieves you of the burden of having to pay the ransom."" In tests, CryptoDrop had spotted 100% of malware samples and stopped it after an average of 10 files had been encrypted, researchers said. In May, the FBI issued a warning saying that the number of ransomware attacks had doubled in the past year and was expected to grow even more rapidly this year. It said that it had received more than 2,400 complaints last year and estimated losses from such attacks at $24m (Â£18m) for individuals and businesses. Governments, large companies, banks, hospitals and educational institutions are all among the victims of such attacks. Richard Cassidy, an expert at security firm Alert Logic said of CryptoDrop: ""Whilst the step taken by researchers at the University of Florida are indeed a novel way in which to detect and contain ransomware, it doesn't serve as the 'silver bullet' for ransomware as a whole."" ""There are new variants being written all the time and ransomware writers will indeed take the time to dissect and understand how this new technology operates, creating versions that will attempt to either bypass detection, or at the very least search more effectively for likely sensitive files, before encrypting them, with the hope of having the biggest impact of securing a ransom payment."" The team at UF currently has a prototype that works with Windows-based systems.  It is seeking a commercial partner for the software, having recently presented its paper on the technology at a conference in Japan.

The National Cyber Security Centre has issued an alert after a recent spike in attacks on educational institutions. These have been ""ransomware"" incidents which block access to computer systems. Paul Chichester, the NCSC's director of operations, says such attacks are ""reprehensible"". The return to school, college and university, already facing problems with Covid-19, now faces an increased risk from cyber-attacks, which the security agency says could ""de-rail their preparations for the new term"". 'Devastating' The cyber-security body, part of the GCHQ intelligence agency, says attacks can have a ""devastating impact"" and take weeks or months to put right. Newcastle University and Northumbria have both been targeted by cyber-attacks this month, and a group of further education colleges in Yorkshire and a higher education college in Lancashire faced attacks last month. Newcastle University faces cyber-attack Northumbria University hit by cyber-attack UK universities in Blackbaud attack Leeds college group under cyber-attack Hackers beat university cyber-defences in two hours Students blamed for college cyber-attacks The warning from the NCSC follows a spate of ransomware attacks against academic institutions - in which malicious software or ""malware"" is used to lock out users from their own computer systems, paralysing online services, websites and phone networks. The security agency says this is often followed by a ransom note demanding payment for the recovery of this frozen or stolen data - sometimes with the added threat of publicly releasing sensitive information. image copyright Google image caption Newcastle University faced a cyber-attack this month Universities have frequently been targets of cyber-attacks - with up to a thousand attacks per year in the UK.  Attacks can be attempts to obtain valuable research information that is commercially and politically sensitive. Universities also hold much personal data about students, staff and, in some cases, former students who might have made donations. Earlier this summer  more than 20 universities and charities in the UK, US and Canada were caught up in a ransomware cyber-attack  involving a cloud computing supplier, Blackbaud. A Freedom of Information inquiry in July, carried out by the TopLine Comms digital public relations company, found 35 UK universities, out of 105 responses, had faced ransomware attacks over the past decade. There were 25 which had not had attacks - and a further 43 which declined to answer. One university reported 42 separate ransomware attacks since 2013. The warning from the NCSC highlights the vulnerability of online systems for remote working, as increased numbers of staff are working from home.  ""Phishing"" attacks, where people are tricked into clicking on a malicious link such as in an email, also remains a common pathway for such ransomware attempts, says the advice. 'Criminal targeting' Mr Chichester of the NCSC says: ""The criminal targeting of the education sector, particularly at such a challenging time, is utterly reprehensible."" ""I would strongly urge all academic institutions to take heed of our alert."" Universities UK says data security has had to become a priority for higher education - and that ""protections are in place to manage threats as much as possible"". The universities body also says it is working with the NCSC to produce ""robust guidance on cyber-security"" which will be released later this academic year.

Its popularity means malware is now responsible for 51% of all the incidents analysed in the  annual Verizon data breach report. This analyses almost 2,000 breaches to find out how firms were caught out by cyber-thieves. It also found that measures taken by some firms after payment systems were targeted, stopped new breaches. Glimmer of hope The rapid rise in the number of successful ransomware attacks was widely expected, said Marc Spitler, senior manager in Verizon's security research division, simply because so many malicious hacking groups were adopting the tactic. ""Ransomware is all about how can they get more money per infected device,"" he said.   A separate  report by security firm Symantec  found that the average amount paid by victims of ransomware had risen to $1,077 (Â£834). Consumers were likely to be hit straight away with ransomware, said Mr Spitler, but attacks on businesses were stealthier. Often, he said, attackers burrowed deeper into a company's infrastructure to find key databases that were then scrambled before payment was sought. In most attacks, booby-trapped attachments sent via email were the main delivery mechanism for ransomware and other malware, found the report.  ""These attacks are all about getting a foothold on a system,"" he said, adding that once attackers were inside an organisation they typically looked to use the back doors for many different types of attack. Darren Thomson, chief technology officer for Symantec in Europe, said its statistics suggest about one in every 131 email messages was now harbouring some kind of cyber-threat. ""They are arriving in Word documents and Excel spreadsheets,"" he said, ""the messages people get many times a day."" The Verizon report also spotted a shift in the targets of cyber-attacks with 61% of victims now being companies with fewer than 1,000 employees. The good news, said Mr Spitler, was that some industry sectors that had been hit hard before, now appeared less often in its attack statistics - suggesting their digital defences were starting to work. ""The lack of large retailers suffering point-of-sale intrusions was a glimmer of hope,"" he said.

There are now more than 120 separate families of ransomware, said experts studying the malicious software. Other researchers have seen a 3,500% increase in the criminal use of net infrastructure that helps run ransomware campaigns. The rise is driven by the money thieves make with ransomware and the increase in kits that help them snare victims. Ransomware is malicious software that scrambles the data on a victim's PC and then asks for payment before restoring the data to its original state. The costs of unlocking data vary, with individuals typically paying a few hundred pounds and businesses a few thousand. Rapid growth ""Ransomware and crypto malware are rising at an alarming rate and show no signs of stopping,"" said Raj Samani, European technology head for Intel Security.  Ransomware samples seen by his company had risen by more than a quarter in the first three months of 2016, he added. Mr Samani blamed the rise on the appearance of freely available source code for ransomware and the debut of online services that let amateurs cash in.  Ransomware was easy to use, low risk and offered a high reward, said Bart Parys, a security researcher who helps to  maintain a list of the growing numbers of types  of this kind of malware. ""The return on investment is very high,"" he said.  image copyright AP image caption Many cyber-thieves using ransomware demand to be paid in bitcoins Mr Parys and his colleagues have now logged 124 separate variants of ransomware. Some virulent strains, such as Locky and Cryptolocker, were controlled by individual gangs, he said, but others were being used by people buying the service from an underground market. ""It's safe to say that certain groups are behind several ransomware programs, but not all,"" he said. ""Especially now with Eda and HiddenTear copy and paste ransomware, there are many new, and often unexperienced, cybercriminals."" A separate indicator of the growth of ransomware came from the amount of net infrastructure that gangs behind the malware had been seen using. The numbers of web domains used to host the information and payment systems had grown 35-fold, said Infoblox in its annual report which monitors these chunks of the net's infrastructure. ""They use it and customise it for each attack, "" said Rod Rasmussen, vice-president of security at Infoblox.  ""They will have their own command and control infrastructure and they might use it to generate domains for a campaign,"" he told the BBC. ""Then they'll have some kind of payment area that victims can go to."" ""The different parts are tied to particular parts of the chain,"" he said. ""Infection, exploitation and ransom."" Hidden files media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The spread of ransomware was also being aided by tricks cyber-thieves used to avoid being detected by security software, said Tomer Weingarten, founder of security company SentinelOne. ""Traditional anti-virus software is not effective in dealing with these types of attacks,"" he said. The gangs behind the most prevalent ransomware campaigns had got very good at hiding their malicious code, said Mr Weingarten. ""Where we see the innovation is in the infection vector,"" he said. SentinelOne had seen gangs using both well-known techniques and novel technical tricks to catch out victims.  A lot of ransomware reached victims via spear-phishing campaigns or booby-trapped adverts, he said, but other gangs used specialised ""crypters"" and ""packers"" that made files look benign.  Others relied on inserting malware into working memory so it never reached the parts of a computer on which most security software keeps an eye.

One prominent theory right now is North Korea - but what we know is far from conclusive.  You may not have heard of the Lazarus Group, but you may be aware of its work. The devastating  hack on Sony Pictures in 2014 , and another on a  Bangladeshi bank in 2016 , have both been attributed to the highly sophisticated group.  It is widely believed that the Lazarus Group worked out of China, but on behalf of the North Koreans.  Security experts are now cautiously linking the Lazarus Group to this latest attack after a discovery by Google security researcher  Neel Mehta . He found similarities between code found within WannaCry - the software used in the hack - and other tools believed to have been created by the Lazarus Group in the past.  It's a mere sliver of evidence, but there are other clues to consider too. Cyber-attack: Your questions answered Should you pay the WannaCry ransom? Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk? Global manhunt for WannaCry creators Picking apart the code Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert, pointed out to me that the text demanding the ransom uses what reads like machine-translated English, with a Chinese segment apparently written by a native speaker. ""As you can see it's pretty thin and all circumstantial,"" Prof Woodward said. ""However, it's worth further investigation."" image copyright EPA image caption The WannaCry malware threatens to delete users' data unless they pay a ransom ""Neel Mehtaâs discovery is the most significant clue to date regarding the origins of WannaCry,â said Russian security firm  Kaspersky , but noted a lot more information is needed about earlier versions of WannaCry before any firm conclusion can be reached.  ""We believe itâs important that other researchers around the world investigate these similarities and attempt to discover more facts about the origin of WannaCry,â the company added.  ""Looking back to the Bangladesh attack, in the early days, there were very few facts linking them to the Lazarus Group.  ""In time, more evidence appeared and allowed us, and others, to link them together with high confidence. Further research can be crucial to connecting the dots.""  Attributing cyber-attacks can be notoriously difficult - often relying on consensus rather than confirmation.   For example, North Korea has never admitted any involvement in the Sony Pictures hack - and while security researchers, and the US government, have confidence in the theory, neither can rule out the possibility of a false flag.  Skilled hackers may have simply made it look like it had origins in North Korea by using similar techniques.  'Wouldnât stand up in court' In the case of WannaCry, it is possible that hackers simply copied code from earlier attacks by the Lazarus Group.  media caption How to protect yourself online But Kaspersky said false flags within WannaCry were ""possible"" but ""improbable"", as the shared code was removed from later versions.  ""There's a lot of ifs in there,"" added Prof Woodward.  ""It wouldn't stand up in court as it is. But it's worth looking deeper, being conscious of confirmation bias now that North Korea has been identified as a possibility."" Itâs the strongest theory yet as to the origin of WannaCry, but there are also details that arguably point away from it being the work of North Korea.   image copyright Getty Images image caption Few could have suspected a Seth Rogen-directed film would have such global political repercussions First, China was among the countries worst hit, and not accidentally - the hackers made sure there was a version of the ransom note written in Chinese. It seems unlikely North Korea would want to antagonise its strongest ally. Russia too was badly affected.  Second, North Korean cyber-attacks have typically been far more targeted, often with a political goal in mind.  In the case of Sony Pictures, hackers sought to prevent the release of The Interview, a film that mocked North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. WannaCry, in contrast, was wildly indiscriminate - it would infect anything and everything it could.  Finally, if the plan was simply to make money, itâs been pretty unsuccessful on that front too - only around $60,000 (Â£46,500) has been paid in ransoms, according to analysis of Bitcoin accounts being used by the criminals.   With more than 200,000 machines infected, it's a terrible return. But then of course, maybe the ransom was a distraction for some other political goal not yet clear.   Another possibility is that the Lazarus Group worked alone, without instruction from North Korea. Indeed, it could be that the Lazarus Group isnât even linked to North Korea.  More questions than answers - and in cyber-war, facts are extremely hard to come by.

The National Cyber Security Centre has advised firms how to protect computers as they start the working week. It comes after Friday's attack caused disruption in 150 countries. In the UK, NHS hospitals, pharmacies and GP surgeries were the worst-affected. A handful of NHS trusts are still dealing with the problems it caused. Is my computer at risk? Analysis: How it started In a statement, the National Cyber Security Centre said a ransomware attack of this type and on this scale could happen again although there is ""no specific evidence"" as yet.   It said it knew of attempts to attack organisations other than the NHS, and warned more cases could ""come to light"" in the UK and elsewhere as the new working week begins. Ransomware attacks are ""some of the most immediately damaging forms of cyber-attack"", it said, and advised companies to: Keep your organisation's security software patches up to date Use proper anti-virus software services Back up the data that matters to you, because you can't be held to ransom for data you hold somewhere else media caption How to protect yourself online What happened? The NHS, Fedex and the main telecoms operator in Spain were among 200,000 known victims  - organisations and private individuals - of Friday's global cyber-attack. The ransomware, which locked users' files and demanded payment to allow access, spread to 150 countries, including Russia, the US and China. In England, 47 trusts reported problems at hospitals, GP surgeries or pharmacies and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected.  Some hospitals were forced to cancel treatment and appointments and, unable to use computers, many doctors resorted to using pen and paper.  The cost of the attack is unknown, in the UK or beyond, but BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggest hackers have already been paid the equivalent of Â£22,080.  What can patients expect? The Scottish government said the cyber-attack had been isolated and it expected that most NHS computers would be back to normal by Monday. NHS England has told patients to attend hospital if they have an appointment unless they are told not to. However, several trusts in England have issued their own advice to patients. As of Sunday night they were: St Bartholomew's in London - IT disruption ongoing. Planned surgery and outpatient appointments will be reduced on Monday at the trust's five hospitals - the Royal London, Newham, Whipps Cross, Mile End and St Bartholomew's. Patients should attend booked appointments on Monday unless their hospital contacts them to say otherwise East and North Hertfordshire Trust  - Patients should assume their appointment is going ahead unless they hear otherwise. Neither Lister Hospital nor the New QE2 are doing non-urgent blood tests James Paget University Hospitals Trust, Norfolk - All clinical and surgical appointments this weekend were cancelled. Patients with appointments on Monday and Tuesday are being advised to attend unless they hear from their hospital. A&E wait times are longer than usual Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust - Problems continuing with IT systems. Patients scheduled for surgery on Monday are being told not to attend unless they are contacted. All outpatient and endoscopy appointments for Monday are cancelled Lincolnshire Hospitals NHS Trust  - Outpatient appointments, diagnostic tests and routine operations are cancelled on Monday York Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust - Services are ""almost back to normal"" albeit a little slower so patients can assume their appointments on Monday will go ahead Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh - People are told to avoid A&E unless it is an emergency. The trust is working to restore its IT systems What are the political parties saying? The government is insisting that the NHS had been repeatedly warned about the cyber-threat to their IT systems.  Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said Â£50m of Â£1.9bn set aside for UK cyber-protection was being spent on NHS cyber systems to improve their security. media caption The NHS has been given about Â£50m to improve its computer systems, defence minister Michael Fallon says. But Labour say the Conservatives have cut funding to the NHS's IT budget and specifically a contract to protect computer systems was not renewed after 2015. The Liberal Democrats and Labour have both demanded an inquiry into the cyber-attack.  In an interview on BBC One's Andrew Marr show, Sir Michael said NHS trusts had been encouraged to ""reduce their exposure to the weakest system, the Windows XP"", with fewer than 5% of trusts using it now.  ""We want them to use modern systems that are better protected. We warned them, and they were warned again in the spring. They were warned again of the threats,"" he added. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has written to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt to ask why concerns repeatedly flagged up about the NHS's ""outdated, unsupported and vulnerable"" machines had not been addressed. On ITV's Robert Peston, Mr Ashworth accused the government of having ""cut the IT and infrastructure budget"" by Â£1bn in the NHS, and said his party, if elected to power, would put Â£10bn into the infrastructure of the NHS. He called for the Conservatives to publish the  Department of Health's risk register  to see how seriously they were taking IT threats. Scottish Justice Secretary Michael Matheson said more than 120 public bodies were being contacted to ensure their defences were adequate. What are others saying? Kingsley Manning, a former chairman of NHS Digital - which provides the health service's IT systems - told the BBC on Saturday that several hundred thousand computers were still running on Windows XP. And a neurology registrar from London, Dr Krishna Chinthapalli, wrote an article for the British Medical Journal just a week ago,  warning that hospitals would ""almost certainly be shut down by ransomware this year"". He told the BBC the NHS was in a tricky position - treating sick patients, as a 24/7 operation with specialist software - making update implementation complicated.  ""People developing ransomware know a hospital is a good target because the information is about patients and is time-sensitive - hospitals need to get their data back quicker,"" he said.  Attacks on hospital data and patients were ""despicable at the basic level"", he said. image copyright PA Meanwhile, digital rights campaigners Open Rights Group has accused GCHQ of a ""very dangerous strategy of hoarding knowledge of security problems"". It said Britain's electronic surveillance agency was ""in charge of hacking us and protecting us from hackers"", making it hard to balance the risks of keeping vulnerabilities secret. Jim Killock, the group's executive director, said: ""US and UK security agencies kept a widespread vulnerability secret rather than telling the companies so they could fix it."" He called for the National Cyber Security Centre to be made independent from GCHQ. Has the virus been stopped? It's unlikely. Europol head Rob Wainwright said he was concerned that the number affected would continue to rise when people returned to work on Monday morning. He told the BBC there was  an escalating threat from the virus , known as Wanna Decryptor or WannaCry, adding: ""We've never seen anything like this - it's unprecedented in scale."" media caption Europol director Rob Wainwright warned that companies must patch their systems before Monday morning Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning Are you a patient or an NHS employee?

The 22-year-old man, known by the pseudonym MalwareTech, had taken a week off work, but decided to investigate the ransomware after hearing about the global cyber-attack. He managed to bring the spread to a halt when he found what appeared to be a ""kill switch"" in the rogue software's code. ""It was actually partly accidental,"" he told the BBC, after spending the night investigating. ""I have not slept a wink."" Although his discovery did not repair the damage done by the ransomware, it did stop it spreading to new computers, and he has been hailed an ""accidental hero"". ""I would say that's correct,"" he told the BBC. Cyber-attack scale 'unprecedented' NHS 'robust' after cyber-attack ""The attention has been slightly overwhelming. The boss gave me another week off to make up for this train-wreck of a vacation."" What exactly did he discover? The researcher first noticed that the malware was trying to contact a specific web address every time it infected a new computer. But the web address it was trying to contact - a long jumble of letters - had not been registered. MalwareTech decided to register it, and bought it for $10.69 (Â£8).  Owning it would let him see where computers were accessing it from, and give him an idea of how widespread the ransomware was. image copyright MalwareTech image caption Owning the web address let MalwareTech monitor where infections were happening By doing so, he unexpectedly triggered part of the ransomware's code that told it to stop spreading. Analysis: How did it start? What is the ransomware? This type of code is known as a ""kill switch"", which some attackers use to halt the spread of their software if things get out of hand.  He tested his discovery and was delighted when he managed to trigger the ransomware on demand. ""Now you probably can't picture a grown man jumping around with the excitement of having just been 'ransomwared', but this was me,""  he said in a blog post . MalwareTech now thinks the code was originally designed to thwart researchers trying to investigate the ransomware, but it backfired by letting them remotely disable it. Does this mean the ransomware is defeated? While the registration of the web address appears to have stopped one strain of the ransomware spreading from device-to-device, it does not repair computers that are already infected.  Security experts have also warned that new variants of the malware that ignore the ""kill switch"" will appear. ""This variant shouldn't be spreading any further, however there'll almost certainly be copycats,""  said security researcher Troy Hunt  in a blog post. MalwareTech warned: ""We have stopped this one, but there will be another one coming and it will not be stoppable by us. ""There's a lot of money in this, there is no reason for them to stop. It's not much effort for them to change the code and start over.""

The prime minister said the incident was part of an untargeted wider attack  affecting organisations globally. Some hospitals and GPs have been unable to access patient data, after their computers were locked by a ransomware program demanding a payment worth Â£230. But there is no evidence patient data has been compromised, NHS Digital said. The BBC understands about 40 NHS organisations and some GP practices have been hit. The NHS in Wales and Northern Ireland has not been affected. There is no indication of who is behind the attack yet, but the hackers demanded their payment in the virtual currency Bitcoin, which is harder to trace.  Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""This is not targeted at the NHS, it's an international attack and a number of countries and organisations have been affected."" Ambulances diverted Mrs May added that the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) was ""working closely"" with the NHS ""to ensure that they support the organisations concerned and that they protect patient safety"". Ambulances have been diverted from hospitals in some areas and there has been disruption at some GP surgeries as a result of the attack. NHS England said patients in an emergency should go to A&E or access emergency services as they normally would. Dr Anne Rainsberry, NHS incident director, added: ""More widely, we ask people to use the NHS wisely while we deal with this major incident, which is still ongoing."" Who has been hit by the NHS cyber attack? Explaining the global malware outbreak media caption Angry doctors, disappointed patients: Reactions to the cyber-attack on the NHS A massive ransomware campaign appears to have attacked a number of organisations around the world, with reports of infections in more than 70 countries. Telefonica, the Spanish telecoms company which owns mobile network O2, said it had detected a  ""cybersecurity incident""  but that clients and services had not been affected. Screenshots of a program that locks computers and demands a payment in Bitcoin have been shared online by those affected. NHS Digital said the attack was believed to have been carried out by the malware variant Wanna Decryptor. ""Our focus is on supporting organisations to manage the incident swiftly and decisively, but we will continue to communicate with NHS colleagues and will share more information as it becomes available,"" it said. Why has the NHS been hit so hard? media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? There could be a lot of reasons why the NHS was hit so hard by this attack. The most likely one is because it is a huge organisation supported by a massive IT infrastructure.  It also has lots of partners and suppliers that connect to its core network. Complexity is the enemy of security and it is a fair bet that some bits of that network, especially those operated by suppliers, are not as well maintained as they should be.  This could mean that patches that would have thwarted WannaCry were not applied. So, as soon as the worm got in, it could run rampant. Dr Chris Mimnagh, who works at a medical centre in Liverpool, said the attack had made its job impossible. ""Our entire patient record is accessed through the computer - blood results, history, medicines.  ""Most of our prescribing is done electronically... it's sent direct to the pharmacy and... all that is not able to be accessed when we lose the clinical system."" 'Power of the state' Dr Emma Fardon, a GP in Dundee, said she had returned from house visits to find a message on the surgery's computers asking for money. ""We can't access any patient records. Everything is fully computerised,"" she said. ""We have no idea what drugs people are on or the allergies they have. We can't access the appointments system.""  media caption NHS chief Saffron Cordery tells PM that hospitals are cancelling their operations Dr Afzal Ashraf, an expert on cyber-security who has previously worked as an adviser to the government, told the BBC it was likely that the malware was spreading when NHS services shared documents and information.  But he also said he thought it was unlikely the attackers had deliberately targeted the NHS.  He added: ""I think they probably attacked a small company assuming they would get a small amount of money but it's got into the NHS system and now they have the full power of the state against them - because obviously the government cannot afford for this sort of thing to happen and be successful.""

An  unidentified programmer  has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up. In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer. The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265).  It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work.  Scrambling schemes Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer  in seven seconds .  But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive.  And Mr Abrams said: ""Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task.""  This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said. Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the  website set up to help people  unlock their computer. Independent security analyst Graham Cluley said there had been other occasions when ransomware makers had ""bungled"" their encryption system. Cryptolocker, Linux.encoder and one other ransomware variant were all rendered harmless when their scrambling schemes were reverse-engineered. ""Of course,"" said Mr Cluley, ""the best thing is to have safety secured backups rather than relying upon ransomware criminals goofing up.""

Ransomware encrypts data on infected machines and then asks for money before restoring access to information. The FBI is analysing a strain of ransomware called MSIL/Samas that tries to encrypt data across entire networks rather than single computers. The plea comes as security firms warn about other novel strains of the fast-growing, data-scrambling cyber-threats.  Bulk discount The FBI sent out the request for help after discovering that the group behind MSIL/Samas had stepped up its efforts to find victims.  In the confidential advisory obtained by Reuters, the FBI said the group used a publicly available security program called Jexboss to scan networks looking for vulnerable versions of the widely used JBoss software. When a vulnerable system is found, the malware launches an attack that seeks to scramble data on servers. It also finds and deletes the back-up files firms could use to restore data scrambled by ransomware.  Cisco said  it had seen a  ""widespread campaign"" using Samas targeting firms involved in healthcare. Early versions of the malware charged a ransom of one bitcoin (Â£300) for every machine hit but later versions upped this to 1.5 bitcoins.  image caption Many hospitals in the US have been hit by ransomware infections ""It is likely the malware author is trying to see how much people will pay for their files,"" wrote Cisco security analyst Nick Biasini  in an advisory . ""They even added an option for bulk decryption of 22 bitcoin (Â£6,600) to decrypt all infected systems."" The FBI's request for aid comes as security firms warn about recently created ransomware variants that use different methods to lock up systems and force victims to pay. The Petya malware targets a key Windows system file called the Master Boot Record that helps a PC get started. By overwriting this file, people are prevented from getting at any data on their PC unless they pay up. Trend Micro said it had seen Petya distributed in email messages crafted to look like they are from someone looking for work. The CV attached to the message is a booby-trapped program that launches Petya, said Trend security engineer Jasen Sumalapao  in a blogpost . Petya charges a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265) to unlock infected machines.  Security firm Carbon Black has found another novel strain that goes after many firms that use Windows PowerShell - a scripting program widely used to administer machines running Windows.  Dubbed PowerWare, this strain hides malicious code in Word documents and calls on PowerShell to execute the attack code when the booby-trapped files are opened. ""Deceptively simple in code, 'PowerWare' is a novel approach to ransomware, reflecting a growing trend of malware authors thinking outside the box in delivering ransomware,""  said Rico Valdez from Carbon Black .

Chinese hackers are launching sophisticated ransomware attacks - in which they hijack machines and demand payment to decrypt them, according to reports. Four separate security firms have spotted attacks they believe emanated from China in recent months, reveals Reuters. There is speculation that the ""skilled operators"" could be state-sponsored hackers. The Chinese government said it would investigate if there was reliable proof. Reliable proof Dell SecureWorks investigated two ransomware attacks this year - one at a transportation company and one at a technology firm In the second case, 30% of the unnamed firm's machines were captured by the hackers. Phil Burdette, who heads an incident response team at Dell said: ""It is obviously a group of skilled operators that have some amount of experience conducting intrusions."" Security firms Attack Research, InGuardians and G-C Partners said they had investigated three other similar attacks since December. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman told Reuters that it would not act on ""rumours and speculation"" but the ministry itself said that if there was reliable proof, it would treat the matter seriously. The Chinese government pledged to oppose economic espionage in an agreement with the US last year, with some US firms since reporting a drop in the amount of hacking sourced from China. It also wants deeper internet security co-operation with the US as hacking continues to be a sore spot in US-China relations. If the government has reduced its support for economic espionage, that may mean hackers are looking for other means of supplementing their incomes, reports Reuters. Recently security firms warned about a huge surge in junk mail messages containing ransomware, which was blamed on new malware hitting the market which can avoid being spotted by anti-virus software. Ransomware has been around for years but better encryption techniques mean it is often impossible for victims to regain access to their files without co-operation from the hackers. Many ransomware payments are made in the virtual currency Bitcoin, and few firms are open about such attacks.

We'll discuss the biggest cybersecurity threat of the moment, the use of bots in the fight to get the upper hand on social media during the US elections and the ongoing debate about the risks of artificial intelligence. Ransomware image copyright Thinkstock This week, producer Jat Gill and I attended a demo by security firm Sophos which left us both rather scared. James Lyne from the firm played a bad guy launching an attack on a company, while two colleagues played the increasingly confused system administrators trying to work out what was going on as chaos engulfed the network. We then heard that the  principle weapon in the attackers' armoury was now ransomware.  This is malicious software that first takes over your network, then encrypts all your files before demanding a ransom - usually in Bitcoin - to unlock them. This is now proving a major threat to organisations from hospitals to police forces - we don't know the exact scale of the problem because it seems many quietly pay up without telling anybody. What's really scary is that some of this ransomware is now out there on the internet but without any way of even paying the criminals behind it, who have long since moved on. That means there is no way of unlocking your encrypted files. So what's to be done? James Lyne tells us that companies which regularly update their security systems should be safe - but the most important advice is to make regular back-ups of your files, and make sure they are insulated from the rest of your network. Bots for Trump image copyright Getty Images image caption The second debate was marked by the personal attacks each candidate made about the other Computational propaganda is the term  Professor Philip Howard of Oxford University  uses to describe his research project. He is on this week's show talking about his study of Twitter activity during the Presidential debates.  His research - which has not yet been peer reviewed - appears to show that  many more automated accounts are being used to tweet in support of Donald Trump  than the bots backing Hillary Clinton. During British election campaigns I get bombarded with reports from sentiment analysis firms, claiming they can mine Twitter to understand who is winning over voters. Those claims always seemed dubious - even more so, now that it appears that expertise in running bots is becoming the prime weapon in social media campaigning. The ethics of AI image copyright Getty Images image caption Stephen Hawking has warned about the dangers of artificial intelligence. At a period  when new advances in Artificial Intelligence seem to be reported every day, the ethical issues surrounding its impact on our lives are rising up the agenda.  This week saw the opening of an AI think tank,  the Centre for the Future of Intelligence, in Cambridge  with Prof Stephen Hawking renewing his warnings  that the technology could bring extraordinary benefits to mankind - but could also spell the end for us. Then on Thursday night I took part in a Cambridge Union debate opposing the motion: ""This House fears the rise of artificial intelligence"". I'm afraid to report that our side lost - and fear won - though all the speakers agreed we needed a more nuanced view of AI. And that's what we get on Friday's programme from one of the pioneers of artificial intelligence research in the UK, Prof Margaret Boden. She tells us to stop worrying about some apocalypse that is a very remote danger but start thinking about the ethics of using robots to care for the elderly.

The University of Calgary transferred 20,000 Canadian dollars-worth of bitcoins ($15,780; Â£10,840) after it was unable to unwind damage caused by a type of attack known as ransomware. The malware caused emails and other files to become encrypted. One expert warned that the payout would encourage further blackmail attempts. The move comes the same week  Intel warned that ransomware infections  were spreading at ""an alarming rate"". More than 120 separate strains exist, many of which are frequently updated, making it difficult for security experts to offer a solution. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The University of Calgary told a local newspaper that more than 100 of its computers had been affected since it was attacked last month. ""The university is now in the process of assessing and evaluating the decryption keys,""  said the university's vice president Linda Dalgetty . ""The actual process of decryption is time-consuming and must be performed with care.  ""It is important to note that decryption keys do not automatically restore all systems or guarantee the recovery of all data."" She added that the local police force was investigating the matter. Exposure threats The university follows other high-profile bodies to have met cybercriminals' demands in recent weeks. In February, the Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center paid $17,000 to restore access to its system. At the end of the same month, Melrose Police Department in Massachusetts paid $450 after it fell victim to a similar attack. ""It's very tempting for organisations to pay out the ransom because that might be the only way they can get their data back, but that makes it worse for everyone else because it encourages more people to set up schemes like the one used in the Calgary case,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London.

It blamed governments for storing data on software vulnerabilities which could then be accessed by hackers. It says the latest virus exploits a flaw in Microsoft Windows identified by, and stolen from, US intelligence. There are fears of more ""ransomware"" attacks as people begin work on Monday, although few have been reported so far. Live reports: Ransomware cyber-attack fallout Should you pay the WannaCry ransom? Many firms have had experts working over the weekend to prevent new infections. The virus took control of users' files and demanded $300 (Â£230) payments to restore access. The spread of the WannaCry ransomware attack slowed over the weekend but the respite might only be brief, experts have said. More than 200,000 computers have been affected so far. Read more: Is my computer at risk? Blogger halts ransomware 'by accident' How roots can be traced to the US Who is hardest hit? BBC analysis of three accounts linked to the ransom demands suggests about $38,000 (Â£29,400) had been paid by Monday morning. However, the ransomware warning said that the cost would double after three days, so the payments may increase. It threatens to delete files within seven days if no payment is made. The effect in Asian nations so far on Monday has been limited. South Korea said just nine cases of ransomware had been found, giving no further details. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Australian officials said so far only three small-to-medium sized businesses had reported being locked out of their systems while New Zealand's ministry of business said a small number of unconfirmed incidents were being investigated. In Japan, both Nissan and Hitachi reported some units had been affected, while in China energy giant PetroChina said that at some petrol stations customers had been unable to use its payment system. 'Like stealing Tomahawks' A statement from  Microsoft  president and chief legal officer Brad Smith on Sunday criticised the way governments store up information about security flaws in computer systems. ""We have seen vulnerabilities stored by the CIA show up on WikiLeaks, and now this vulnerability stolen from the NSA has affected customers around the world,"" he wrote. media caption Europol director Rob Wainwright warned that companies must patch their systems before Monday morning ""An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the US military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen."" He added: ""The governments of the world should treat this attack as a wake-up call."" The organisation also said that many organisations had failed to keep their systems up to date, allowing the virus to spread. Microsoft said it had released a Windows security update in March to tackle the problem involved in the latest attack, but many users were yet to run it. ""As cybercriminals become more sophisticated, there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their systems,"" Mr Smith said. Analysis: Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter There are going to be some tough questions on Monday for those institutions which didn't do enough to keep their networks secure, as well as the organisations that were best placed to stop it happening in the first place - the NSA and Microsoft. The NSA keeps a chest of cyberweapons to itself so it can hit targets, but Microsoft has long argued that this is dangerous. If there is a flaw in Windows, the company said, surely the safest thing to do is to let its team know straight away so it can be fixed. But then Microsoft also needs to consider what obligation it has to update all users - not just the ones who pay extra for security on older systems.  Updating your computer if you're an individual is a piece of cake, but for a network the size of Britain's National Health Service? Tough - time-consuming, expensive and complex.  For a company like Microsoft to say it won't keep those systems safe unless they shell out more money, then that in itself is something of a ransom. Meanwhile Europol's chief told the BBC the ransomware was designed to allow ""infection of one computer to quickly spread across the networks"", adding: ""That's why we're seeing these numbers increasing all the time."" Although a temporary fix earlier slowed the infection rate, the attackers had now released a new version of the virus, he said. A UK security researcher known as ""MalwareTech"", who helped to limit the ransomware attack, predicted ""another one coming... quite likely on Monday"". MalwareTech, whose name was revealed in UK media to be 22-year-old Marcus Hutchins, was hailed as an ""accidental hero"" after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it. image copyright Reuters Becky Pinkard, from Digital Shadows, a UK-based cyber-security firm, told AFP news agency that it would be easy for the initial attackers or ""copy-cat authors"" to change the virus code so it is difficult to guard against. ""Even if a fresh attack does not materialise on Monday, we should expect it soon afterwards,"" she said. In England, 48 National Health Service (NHS) trusts reported problems at hospitals, doctor surgeries or pharmacies, and 13 NHS organisations in Scotland were also affected. Further attacks feared on UK health system Ransomware and the NHS - the inquest begins Other organisations targeted worldwide included Germany's rail network Deutsche Bahn, Spanish telecommunications operator Telefonica, French carmaker Renault, US logistics giant FedEx and Russia's Interior Ministry.

Hackers disabled computer systems at DÃ¼sseldorf University Hospital and the patient died while doctors attempted to transfer her to another hospital.   Cologne prosecutors officially launched a negligent homicide case this morning saying hackers could be blamed. One expert said, if confirmed, it would be the first known case of a life being lost as a result of a hack. The ransomware attack hit the hospital on the night of 9 September, scrambling data and making computer systems inoperable.  Such attacks are one of the most serious threats in cyber-security with dozens of high profile attacks so far this year. The attackers can demand large payments in cryptocurrency Bitcoin in exchange for a software key that unlocks IT systems.  The female patient, from DÃ¼sseldorf, was due to have scheduled life-saving treatment and was transferred to another hospital in Wuppertal which is roughly 19 miles (30km) away.  Some local reports suggest the hackers did not intend to attack the hospital and in fact were trying to target a different university. Once the hackers had realised their mistake it is reported they gave the hospital the decryption key without demanding payment before disappearing. Detectives have brought in cyber-security experts to ascertain whether there is a link between the hack and the patient's death, with the hospital also likely to be investigated. Germany's national cyber-security authority says it is on site at the hospital helping the hospital's IT staff rebuild systems. Its president Arne SchÃ¶nbohm said hackers took advantage of a well-known vulnerability in a piece of VPN (virtual private network) software developed by Citrix, and warned other organisations to protect themselves from the flaw. ""We warned of the vulnerability as early as January and pointed out the consequences of its exploitation. Attackers gain access to the internal networks and systems and can still paralyse them months later.  ""I can only stress that such warnings should not be ignored or postponed, but need appropriate measures immediately. The incident shows once again how seriously this risk must be taken.""  UK universities lose data to ransomware attack Ransomware attack takes US maritime base offline Former chief executive of the UK's National Cyber Security Centre Ciaran Martin said: ""If confirmed, this tragedy would be the first known case of a death directly linked to a cyber-attack. It is not surprising that the cause of this is a ransomware attack by criminals rather than an attack by a nation state or terrorists.  ""Although the purpose of ransomware is to make money, it stops systems working. So if you attack a hospital, then things like this are likely to happen. There were a few near misses across Europe earlier in the year and this looks, sadly, like the worst might have come to pass."" Last month, technology giant Garmin is understood to have paid hackers a multi-million pound sum after its IT and production systems were taken offline in a ransomware attack. Law enforcement agencies encourage victims not to pay ransoms arguing it fuels organised cyber-crime operations.

The scheme revolves around a website that connects victims and police, gives advice and helps with data recovery. The number of ransomware victims tripled in the first three months of 2016, according to one estimate. Ransomware is malware that typically demands a fee to unscramble important data on a compromised device. The  No More Ransom site  will be updated as ransomware gangs are tackled, one of the project's partners said. Co-ordinated by Europol, the initiative also involves the Dutch national police, Intel Security and Kaspersky Labs.  ""For a few years now ransomware has become a dominant concern for EU law enforcement,"" said Wil van Gemert, Europol's deputy director of operations.  ""We expect to help many people to recover control over their files, while raising awareness and educating the population on how to maintain their devices clean from malware.""   More victims No More Ransom brings together information about what ransomware is, how to avoid falling victim and what to do if a person or company is caught out. ""Right now the only option victims have is to pay the ransom or not,"" said Raj Samani, European head of Intel Security. ""This gives people another option."" Often, people struggle to find out what they can do when they are hit. With this website, victims will be able to upload scrambled files to identify which strain of ransomware has locked up their data, he said. image copyright AP image caption Many cyber-thieves using ransomware demand to be paid in bitcoins ""We've seen a threefold increase in infected victims from January to March this year,"" he added. ""And we're seeing a rise in new families of ransomware coming up all the time."" In June, one site that tracks ransomware logged more than 120 separate families of the malicious code being used in different campaigns.  ""It's becoming a hugely profitable economy for the criminals,"" said Mr Samani. ""They know there's real money to be made here. ""What's particularly telling is that historically ransomware victims have been consumers and small businesses,"" he said. ""But we are now seeing bigger institutions, hospitals and universities, getting hit."" The site will be kept up to date with information gleaned from international action against gangs that run ransomware campaigns, Mr Samani said.  Other police forces, security companies and researchers will be encouraged to contribute to the site and add advice or tools to help victims.  At present, the site links to decryption software for four well-known families of ransomware - Coinvault, Shade, Rannoh and Rakhni.

The systems, at Kentucky Methodist Hospital, Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, California, are now running normally again. None of the hospitals is believed to have paid the ransom. And the cases are now being investigated by the FBI. Internal emergency media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? The Kentucky Methodist Hospital had to shut down all of its desktop computers and activate a back-up system. A message on its homepage said: ""Methodist Hospital is currently working in an internal state of emergency due to a computer virus that has limited our use of electronic web-based services.  ""We are currently working to resolve this issue, until then we will have limited access to web-based services and electronic communications."" It later said no patient data or care had been affected.  Fred Ortega, a spokesman for Prime Healthcare Services, which owns Chino Valley Medical Center and Desert Valley Hospital, said: ""It did cause significant disruptions of our IT systems.  ""However, most of the systems and the critical infrastructure has been brought back online."" The attack comes weeks after it was revealed Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Centre in Los Angeles had been attacked by ransomware.  In that case, it paid $17,000 to get access to files back. Ransomware growth image copyright Thinkstock Kentucky Methodist Hospital information systems director Jamie Reid named the malware involved as Locky, a new bug that encrypts files, documents and images and renames them with the extension .locky. The most common way Locky gets itself on machines is via a spam email with an attached document that looks like nonsense and advises readers to enable macros ""if the data encoding is incorrect"". Once the malware is downloaded, it sends a message to desktops with instructions about how users can pay to have files unlocked. In November, a report from Intel's McAfee labs said the number of ransomware attacks was expected to grow in 2016. Security expert Brian Krebs said:  ""It's a fair bet that as ransomware attacks and attackers mature, these schemes will slowly become more targeted. ""I also worry that these more deliberate attackers will take a bit more time to discern how much the data they've encrypted is really worth, and precisely how much the victim might be willing to pay to get it back.""

Users took to social media to complain about the emails, which claim to be an order confirmation from the fast-food chain and contain links to malware. The emails also use the victims' names, and appear to come from the chain's Subcard loyalty scheme. Subway has not said whether its databases have been compromised or what the source of the scam is. But the firm has acknowledged that there is a problem. A spokesperson for the company said: ""We are aware of some disruption to our email systems and understand some of our guests have received an unauthorised email."" It apologised for any inconvenience and advised people to delete the email. Sandwich insurance The problem was earlier reported by computer security news site Bleeping Computer , which said it had found a form of malware called TrickBot in the malicious links the email encourages users to click. Trickbot is designed to steal personal information from infected computers, and can also install other viruses and ransomware. The email links to fake documents that supposedly need to be confirmed - including insurance documents for the sandwich, suggesting that the attack had been repurposed from an existing scam. Bleeping Computer reports that these documents include an Excel spreadsheet download, which asks users to enable additional features that install the virus. It is not clear how the attacker accessed the details of customers. Online, some recipients claimed that the attack email appeared to come from the address that the company usually uses. Update 12 December: Subway has issued a fresh statement: ""Having investigated the matter, we have no evidence that guest accounts have been hacked. However, the system which manages our email campaigns has been compromised, leading to a phishing campaign that involved first name and email.

Security firms are warning about a sudden ""huge"" surge in junk mail messages containing ransomware. The surge is being blamed on the group behind a novel strain of ransomware called Locky. One security firm reported that a version of Locky produced two weeks ago is now the second most prevalent form of ransomware it sees. The US, France and Japan were the top targets for the gang behind Locky, statistics suggested. Peak spam Like many other ransomware programs, Locky encrypts data on an infected machine and then asks for a payment before providing a decryption key. Currently Locky asks for 3 bitcoins (Â£885) as payment.  The first versions of Locky hid the malicious attachment that did the encrypting in add-ons or macros for Microsoft Word. Now, say security firms, its creators have switched to using attachments written in Javascript. ""We are currently seeing extraordinary (sic) huge volumes of Javascript attachments being spammed out,"" said Rodel Mendrez, a security expert at  Trustwave in a blogpost .  The switch to Javascript has helped Locky avoid being spotted by anti-virus software, said Trustwave.  At peak spamming times, wrote Mr Mendrez, about 200,000 messages an hour carrying ransomware attachments were hitting its junk mail spotting servers.  Security firm Fortinet said it had caught almost 19 million copies of ransomware emails over the last two weeks. The latest version of Locky using the Javascript attachment accounted for 16.5% of this total,  said Roland Dela Paz in a blogpost .  The most prevalent ransomware family in that total was Cryptowall which was found in 83.5% of the ransomware emails it had caught. Cryptowall first appeared in early 2014. The spam surge had helped establish Locky as a ""significant presence"" in the ransomware world, said Mr Dela Paz. The attackers sending out large amounts of Locky spam were using the same network of hijacked computers, known as a botnet, that was used to distribute the Dridex banking trojan.  ""It's the same botnet, different day, and different payload,"" said Mr Mendrez.  To avoid falling victim, people and companies should regularly back up data so it can be restored if a machine gets infected, he said.

Unlike executable program files, Javascript documents do not always trigger a security warning on Windows or require administrator access to run. Named RAA, the malware is disguised as a document and starts encrypting files immediately when opened. One security expert said the approach was likely to fool many victims. ""It's an interesting approach to ransomware,"" said Ken Munro of security company Pen Test Partners. ""Using Javascript as an attachment to an email is likely to result in many victims accidentally installing it."" The RAA ransomware was discovered by security researchers known as  Benkow  and  JamesWT. It is sent to victims by email and if opened on a Windows machine uses the ""Windows Based Script Host"" to run its code. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Typically an executable program such as an .exe or .bat file would be automatically screened and blocked by the operating system, but Windows allows .js files to run. If opened, the ransomware sets about encrypting the victim's files and displays a ransom note written in Russian. It demands a fee of $250 (Â£171) for the files to be restored. In April, Microsoft reported that it had seen an increase in malware being spread through Javascript email attachments. ""It is interesting to note that an Office attachment with malicious macros typically requires two or more clicks on the document to run it. One click to open the document and another click to enable the macros,"" the firm  said in a blog post. ""On the other hand, the Javascript attachments only take one or two clicks to start executing."" Protection Mr Munro said people should avoid opening attachments from unknown sources to stay safe. ""The .js (Javascript) file type is automatically blocked in some email packages, particularly Outlook,"" said Mr Munro. ""But interestingly Gmail doesn't appear to block it. Don't open unknown attachments, particularly those with a .js extension. ""While we're there, don't open macro enabled Office docs either (such as .docm and .xlsm files) - and keep your anti-virus right up to date."" Additionally, Windows can be instructed not to start the ""Windows Based Script Host"" when a .js file is double-clicked. Virus blog  Bleeping Computer reports  that there is currently no way to reverse the RAA encryption without paying the ransom.   Often, restoring files from a back-up copy is the only way to get files back without paying - although some examples of  ransomware have been cracked.

A second meeting is planned for 07:00 on Saturday. Nicola Sturgeon said the government was taking immediate steps ""to minimise the impact on patients"".  The health boards which have been affected are: NHS Glasgow NHS Lanakrshire NHS Dumfries and Galloway NHS Forth Valley NHS Tayside NHS Western Isles NHS Borders NHS Fife NHS Ayrshire and Arran NHS Grampian NHS Highland The Scottish Ambulance Service has also been affected. The incidents are thought to be part of a wider attack affecting organisations around the world. NHS cyber-attack - latest updates Ransomware infections reported worldwide The Scottish government said most incidents had been confined to desktop computers in GP surgeries, dental practices and other primary care centres. A spokesman said the only acute hospital sites so far affected had been in NHS Lanarkshire. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said there was ""no evidence"" that patient data had been compromised. She said: ""All necessary steps are being taken to ensure that the cause and nature of this attack is identified. ""Our priority is to ensure that boards get all the support required to identify the full extent of any problems, and return IT systems to normal as soon as possible, so there is as little impact on patient care as possible.

Screenshots shared online purportedly from NHS staff, show a program demanding $300 (Â£230) in Bitcoin that looks similar to ransomware known as  WannaCryptor or WCry . There's no indication of who is behind the attack yet, nor do we know exactly how it infected NHS systems. But hospitals have been targeted with similar software before - it struck  three US hospitals last year . NHS Borders said three community sites had been affected. A spokesman said: ""The networks have been isolated, software has been shut down and there is no immediate risk to patient care or confidentiality. ""All other NHS Borders services are currently operating as normal."" A spokesman for NHS Dumfries and Galloway said: ""Three GP practices have been initially affected and we are taking precautionary measures to prevent any others being affected."" He declined the name the practices involved and said the board was ""comfortable and confident"" with the steps taken but added ""we don't know what we're dealing with"". He added: ""We are monitoring the situation here as are all health boards in Scotland."" NHS Fife said the attack had affected ""a small non-operational area"" of its system. Patient records A spokeswoman said: ""This area has been isolated and taken off the network. ""Staff continue to be able to access patient records and clinical systems are unaffected. It is important to note that out of hours services remain open and available as normal and patient care is unaffected. ""We have taken guidance from Scottish government on how to protect ourselves from any spread and we are also undertaking further preventative work."" Western Isles health board reported some disruption, though the extent was not clear. NHS Forth Valley confirmed that some of its services had also been affected. In a statement the health board said: ""We can confirm that a small number of GP and dental practices in the Forth Valley area have experienced disruption to their it systems which may be linked to the wider IT issues affecting parts of NHS England.

The gang who made the notorious Teslacrypt ransomware virus has shut up shop and released the master key it used to scramble data. The key has been used to to make a free decryption tool that can unscramble files encrypted by the malware. It means many of those hit by the malware will be able to recover data without paying a ransom. It is not yet clear why the gang behind Teslacrypt decided to stop using their malware. Rival hack The Teslacrypt ransomware targeted gamers and, on infected machines, sought to encrypt more than 185 different types of files associated with popular games such as Call of Duty, Minecraft and World of Tanks.  Victims could get their files decrypted by paying a ransom of up to $1,000 (Â£690).  Over the past few weeks, researchers from security firm Eset noticed that the malware was being spammed out far less than usual. Many of the underground distributors of Teslacrypt were swapping to use a different ransomware family called CryptXXX. Eset sent a message to the hackers behind Teslacrypt via the technical support address given on the payment page the malware displays on infected machines. In the message, Eset asked for a copy of the master encryption key. To its surprise, it got a reply in which the hackers said the project was now ""closed"". In the body of the short message was the master encryption key used to scramble files on infected machines. The message ended: ""We are sorry!"" In a blogpost , Eset said it was ""surprised"" that the hackers had released the key so others can make a decryption tool. Paul Ducklin from security firm Sophos said it was ""unusual"" for cyber-thieves to give away their secret key.  ""Only victims who have been hit recently and haven't yet paid up, or victims who backed up their already-encrypted data ""just in case"", will get much use out of the master key at this stage,""  he wrote . Mr Ducklin speculated about why the hackers had decided to stop sending out their ransomware. Perhaps, he said, the gang had been hacked by rivals who released the key to ruin the business of a competitor.

People can use the   Have I Been Pwned  online tool to check if their numbers or emails were compromised. Facebook says the data is from an âoldâ breach in 2019 but privacy watchdogs are now investigating. The data Facebook said it had ""found and fixed"" the breach more than a year-and-a-half ago. But the information has now been published for free in a hacking forum, making it widely available.

A blog on its website  detailing how it did it has  since been altered . According to one cyber-security expert, the claims sounded ""believable"". But others, including Signal's founder, have dismissed them as being risible. The BBC has contacted Cellebrite and Signal for comment. Signal did not reply but  later posted a blog  describing Cellebrite's original post as being ""pretty embarrassing"". 'Amateur hour' Highly encrypted apps such as Signal and Telegram have become popular among people keen to keep their messages private. The adoption rates have worried law enforcement agencies, who feel they are hampering their ability to investigate crimes. ""Apps like these make parsing data for forensic analysis extremely difficult,"" writes Cellebrite. The firm has a series of products, including the UFED (Universal Foresenic Extraction Device) - a system that allows authorities to unlock and access the data on suspects' phones. Cellebrite provided a technical explanation of how it found a decryption key that allowed it to access the messages that Signal stores its database. It then described how it searched Signal's open-source code for clues as to how to breach the database. ""We finally found what we were looking for,"" it writes, with a full explanation of how it did it, which has since been deleted. Its claim suggested that it could ""crack"" Signal's encryption on Android phones to decrypt messages and attachments, but did not mention Apple devices. In response to people questioning Cellebrite's claims, the creator of Signal - Moxie Marlinspike - dismissed the idea that the app had been compromised. ""This was an article about 'advanced techniques' Cellebrite used to decode a Signal message on an unlocked Android device,""  he tweeted . ""They could have also just opened the app to look at the messages. ""The whole article read like amateur hour, which is I assume why they removed it."" John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, an internet watchdog based at the University of Toronto, moved to reassure users that Signal ""remains one of the most secure and private ways to communicate"". ""If they are worried about their chats being extracted from a confiscated device, they can enable disappearing messages,"" he added. 'Extraordinary' claims Signal, owned by the Signal Technology Foundation, puts privacy at the heart of its system, using a system that  had been thought almost impossible to break.  The messaging app is endorsed by whistleblower Edward Snowden, who claims to use it ""every day"".  On its website, it says that it uses state-of-the-art, end-to-end encryption to keep all conversations secure.  ""We can't read your messages or listen to your calls, and no-one else can either."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Signal is used by journalists, business leaders and others to have private conversations Alan Woodward, a professor of computer science at Surrey University, said Signal was ""one of the most secure, if not the most secure, messenger service publicly available"". ""Signal employs end-to-end encryption, but goes further than apps like WhatsApp by obscuring metadata - who talked to who when and for how long,"" he explained. ""Cellebrite seem to have been able to recover the decryption key, which seems extraordinary as they are usually very well protected on modern mobile devices."" He added that if this was indeed true, it was no surprise Cellebrite would have altered its blog. ""I suspect someone in authority told them to, or they realised they may have provided enough detail to allow others - who don't just supply to law-enforcement agencies - to achieve the same result.""

Christopher Hughes, 32, faces three charges which span an eight-year period between December 2011 and January 2020. They include the killing of Martin Kok, 49, who was shot dead at a sex club in the Dutch town of Laren in 2016. Donald Findlay QC pled not guilty on behalf of Mr Hughes during a short hearing at the High Court in Glasgow. The indictment against Mr Hughes alleges he was involved with others in ""serious organised crime"" with locations including Scotland, Portugal, Spain, France, Germany, Italy as well as Holland. It is said he was involved in the importation of cocaine and possessed firearms with the intention of supplying weapons to individuals. The charge also claims Mr Hughes concealed money - described as ""criminal property"" - and that cash was used to pay for weddings, school fees, holidays, watches and cars. 'Encrypted' devices It is further stated ""encrypted"" devices - created to help hide illegal activities from the authorities - were supplied to others named in the charge, including the late Mr Kok. The second charge accuses Mr Hughes of being involved in the supply of cocaine. The final accusation details the alleged murder of Mr Kok in December 2016.

The Internet Watch Foundation said victims ranged from 3-16 years, with some groomed to copy adult pornography. It found 511 examples involving siblings between September and December - roughly one in 30 instances of all ""self-generated content"" in that time. Campaigners say livestreaming services need to do more to protect children. The IWF, which works with police and websites worldwide to take down harmful material, said the Covid-19 pandemic had been a ""perfect storm"" for the abuse. Its chief executive, Susie Hargreaves, said there had been: a greater demand for abusive content an increase in the amount of time spent online by children a rise in the use of livestreaming platforms There was a ""common myth"" abuse involving siblings was limited to poorer countries - but most of the videos the IWF found featured children in the West, including from the UK, US and across Europe. Internet child abuse images 'not purged in lockdown' Online child abuse rising during lockdown Children 'at risk' from encrypted message apps Should governments be given keys to access our messages? Grooming often begins on social-media and gaming platforms, before offenders encourage children on to video-chat or livestreaming services where the abuse then escalates. And abuse of siblings typically involves an older child being coerced into abusing their younger brother or sister. One video, shared online multiple times, involved a brother and sister aged six and three being given instructions by an abuser, the IWF said. 'Heinous offenders' Last December, the government set out its proposed Online Harms Bill, designed to ensure companies provide improved safeguarding measures. It plans to give watchdog Ofcom the power to: block access to online services that fail to protect users  fine technology companies The proposals contained the ""strongest protections"" for children, Safeguarding Minister Victoria Atkins told BBC News.  ""Encouraging siblings to enact sexual abuse demonstrates just how heinous offenders are in this space,"" she added.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Facebook Messenger Rooms, a video chat service, was launched during the pandemic NSPCC online-safety-policy head Andy Burrows said it could be a ""world-leading piece of legislation"" but must follow through with its promise to give Ofcom ""teeth"" to step in and take action. In the past year, in the race to bring video-chat and livestreaming services to market, some technology companies had prioritised profit over making their platforms safe, the charity said. And Mr Burrows raised particular concerns over Facebook's plans to introduce end-to-end encryption - a way of sending information so only the intended receiver can read it - across all of its messenger services. 'Anti-abuse measures' Plans to include it in its video-chat service, Rooms, launched in May, would ""significantly compromise the ability to detect child abuse"", he said. The National Crime Agency said the changes would ""dramatically reduce [Facebook's] ability to provide law-enforcement with the evidence they need"" to prosecute alleged offenders. Facebook said end-to-end encryption ""was already the leading security technology used by many services to keep people safe"" and ""a long-term project"". It added: ""We are committed to building strong anti-abuse measures into our plans. ""Facebook will continue to lead the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect and respond to abuse.""

encryption|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-56671419|"Should firms be more worried about firmware cyber-attacks? By Mary-Ann Russon Business reporter, BBC News Published 13 hours ago Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright Getty Images Computing giant Microsoft recently put out a report claiming that businesses globally are neglecting a key aspect of their cyber-security - the need to protect computers, servers and other devices from firmware attacks. Its survey of 1,000 cyber-security decision makers at enterprises across multiple industries in the UK, US, Germany, Japan and China has revealed that 80% of firms have experienced at least one firmware attack in the past two years.  Yet only 29% of security budgets have been allocated to protect firmware. However,  the new report  comes on the back of a recent significant  security vulnerability affecting Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system . And the computing giant launched a range of extra-secure Windows 10 computers last year that it says will prevent firmware from being tampered with. So is this just an attempt to divert attention and sell more PCs, or should businesses be more worried? How a firmware attack works  Firmware is a type of permanent software code used to control each hardware component in a PC.  Increasingly, cyber-criminals are designing malware that quietly tampers with the firmware in motherboards, which tell the PC to start up, or with the firmware in hardware drivers. This is a sneaky way to neatly bypass a computer's operating system or any software designed to detect malware, because the firmware code is in the hardware, which is a layer below the operating system. Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers unsecured Hundreds of UK firms hacked in global cyber-crisis Cyber-flaw affects 745,000 pacemakers Security experts have told the BBC that even if IT departments are following cyber-security best practices like patching security vulnerabilities in software, or protecting corporate networks from malicious intrusions, many firms are still forgetting about the firmware. ""People don't think about it in terms of their patching - it's not often updated, and when it is, sometimes it breaks things,"" explains Australian cyber-security researcher Robert Potter.  Mr Potter built the Washington Post's cyber-security operations centre and has advised the Australian government on cyber-security. ""Firmware patching can sometimes be tricky, so for a lot of companies, it's become a blind spot."" image copyright Sophos image caption A screenshot of the RobbinHood ransomware There have been several major firmware attacks discovered in the last two years, such as  RobbinHood , a ransomware that uses firmware to gain root access to a victim's computer and then encrypts all files until a Bitcoin ransom has been paid. This malware  held the data of several US city governments hostage in May 2019 .  Another example is  Thunderspy , an attack that utilises the direct memory access (DMA) function that PC hardware components use to talk to each other. This attack is so stealthy that an attacker can read and copy all data on a computer without leaving a trace, and the attack is possible even if the hard drive is encrypted, the computer is locked, or set to sleep. ""If device firmware has no protection in place, or if the protection can be bypassed, then firmware compromise is both incredibly serious and potentially invisible,"" explains Chris Boyd, a malware intelligence analyst at security firm Malwarebytes.   ""Remote or physical compromise which permits rogue code to run can set the stage for data theft, system damage, spying, and more."" Big organisations beware The good news is that firmware attacks are less likely to target consumers, but big firms should beware, according to Gabriel Cirlig, a security researcher with US cyber-security firm Human (formerly White Ops). ""It is a big deal, but fortunately it only works against big organisations, because you need to target specific types of motherboards and firmware,"" he tells the BBC. Typically, cyber-criminals tend to attack operating systems and popular software,  because they only make money  if they can infect the biggest numbers of end users.  Firmware attacks are less common and more complicated to implement than other types of cyber-attacks, but unfortunately the coronavirus pandemic has accelerated the problem.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The pandemic has led to a sharp rise in devices connecting remotely to critical corporate network infrastructure The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency within the US Department of Commerce, continually updates a National Vulnerability Database (NVD) with new security flaws. The database has recorded a five-fold increase in attacks against firmware in the last four years. Coronavirus lockdowns in multiple countries have led to multiple employees working from home and connecting remotely to work servers. Each one of those computers and mobile devices is an opportunity.  Carrying out a firmware attack might be complex, says Mr Cirlig, but if attackers could silently steal critical information from a c-suite executive's laptop, like passwords, they could then use it to infiltrate a company's networks and steal more data.  Nation-state hackers would be most likely to use such an attack, he adds. ""This is a big operation with big pay-offs - it's not something that a small group of cyber-criminals has the manpower to do."" Creeping soon to a network near you Although firmware attacks are not as ubiquitous as phishing scams, malware or other cyber-attacks, the cyber-security experts the BBC spoke to say now is the time for businesses, and the technology industry as a whole,  to pay attention to hardware security . image copyright Getty Images image caption Hardware and firmware designers need to be included in the cyber-security discussion, say experts ""Firmware attacks are not common on a day-to-day basis, but that's because people don't realise they're being infected by such an attack,"" says Mr Boyd.  ""It's like when ransomware first came onto the scene - people didn't know of anyone who was infected by it, and if big organisations were, they wouldn't tell anyone about it, as there was an element of shame, not wanting their clients to know they'd been infected."" Mr Boyd adds that a new generation of ""budding hardware enthusiasts"" who have been learning their way around firmware by ""modding video game consoles over the last decade"" could well pose additional threats to enterprise cyber-security going forward - a point Mt Cirlig fervently agrees with, since he hacked the firmware in his own car when he was younger.  ""Microsoft is right to raise this as a major issue, because we need to bring firmware designers and operational technologies along the journey of cyber-security, the way we have with software companies,"" says Mr Potter.  ""As we connect more things to the internet, we're connecting a lot more devices that haven't been designed with cyber-security in mind. And if the trend continues, bad guys will go after it.""

The firm says it wants to make the measure the default option across its messaging platforms to protect privacy. But activist shareholders say this would make it nearly impossible to detect child exploitation on Facebook. The group wants the company to delay the move until after its board of directors studies the risk further.  ""As shareholders, we know that privacy is important to a social media company, but it should not come at the expense of unleashing a whole new torrent of virtually undetectable child sexual abuse on Facebook,"" said Michael Passoff, founder of Proxy Impact, a shareholder advocacy service supporting  the measure . Facebook's 2020 annual shareholders' meeting will be held virtually due to Covid-19, but investors will still be able to vote on measures and hear about the management plans. Facebook claims to be a leader in fighting child exploitation on the internet.  ""As we expand end-to-end encryption to secure people's private messages from hackers and criminals we remain committed to leading our industry in keeping children safe,"" it said. The measure is unlikely to pass.  Most of the company's voting shares are controlled by Facebook's founder and chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, and a small number of other executives. Plans for more encryption  In March 2019, Mr Zuckerberg said he wanted the firm to make end-to-end encryption the base level of security for all its messaging services - including Facebook Messenger and Instagram messaging. But he did not lay out a timeline, and many engineers thought it would be several years before it happened. The initiative would mean that messages - including text and imagery - are digitally scrambled so that only the sender and receiver can make sense of them, and not Facebook itself. WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook, already has this level of security.  The US, UK and Australian governments have been among those pressuring Facebook to create a backdoor or other workaround that would give them access to  messages to help in criminal investigations. The company has so far refused to do this. image copyright Getty Images image caption Mark Zuckerberg wants full end-to-end encryption across all his companies' messaging services The measure put forward by Proxy Impact would force Facebook to examine whether something could be done to mitigate ""the risk of increased sexual exploitation of children"" as a consequence. In 2019, tech companies reported close to 70 million videos and pictures of children being sexually exploited to authorities. Nearly 85% of those reports came from Facebook. According to Mr Passoff, if the firm were to go through with its encryption plans, 70% of the cases it reports would become invisible to the firm. For Facebook, this is a matter of balancing privacy and public security. Users have expressed anger in the past at Facebook's use and protection of their personal data. End-to-end encryption should prevent criminals from gaining access to private conversations and help protect personal and financial data, assuming users' devices are not compromised. It would also offer the firm a defence against being responsible for detecting and reporting criminal and terrorist activity, as it would no longer be able to read the messages involved. Reputational risk to Facebook Some investors supporting the measure claim this could prove damaging to the company. ""Numerous controversies have eroded its reputational capital and put the company at risk for future competitive threats,"" said Lisette Cooper, vice-chair of Fiduciary Trust International, which is supporting the vote.   ""The position of Facebook as the world's number one hub for online child sexual abuse material is not the marketing strategy you want to have for long-term success."" However, Mr Zuckerberg has previously addressed the issue directly. ""When we were deciding whether to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this was one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,""  he said in October . But he added that he was ""optimistic"" that predators could still be identified by other means, including their patterns of activity.

The company is moving ahead with plans to implement the measure on Facebook Messenger and Instagram Direct.  But more than 100 organisations, led by the NSPCC, have signed an open letter warning the plans will undermine efforts to catch abusers.  Home Secretary Priti Patel said she ""fully supported"" the move. In a statement to the BBC, she said: ""Tech companies like Facebook have a vital responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of vulnerable children."" ""Following my letter to Mark Zuckerberg, I met with Sheryl Sandberg and emphasised that Facebook's encryption plans cannot be allowed to hamper their ability to protect young people from paedophiles online. We have also submitted detailed evidence to the US Senate about these concerns. ""I fully support the continued efforts of the NSPCC and children's charities around the world to engage Facebook on this issue."" End-to-end encryption, already used on Facebook-owned WhatsApp, means no-one, including the company that owns the platform, can see the content of sent messages.   Those signing the letter say Facebook has failed to address concerns about child safety.  The missive urges the company to stop the rollout of its plans until ""sufficient safeguards"" are in place. ""At a time when we could be looking to build upon years of sophisticated initiatives, Facebook instead seems inclined to blindfold itself,"" the letter says.  ""We urge you to recognise and accept that an increased risk of child abuse being facilitated on or by Facebook is not a reasonable trade-off to make. ""Children should not be put in harm's way either as a result of commercial decisions or design choices."" Among the other signatories were Barnardo's, 5Rights, the International Centre For Missing and Exploited Children, and Child USA.  'Safety first' A spokesman for Facebook said protecting the wellbeing of children on its platform was ""critically important"" to it.  ""We have led the industry in safeguarding children from exploitation and we are bringing this same commitment and leadership to our work on encryption,"" he said. ""We are working closely with child-safety experts, including NCMEC [the US National Center for Missing and Exploited Children], law enforcement, governments and other technology companies, to help keep children safe online."" In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the NCMEC. The National Crime Agency said this had led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe. But, the NCMEC estimates, if Facebook implements end-to-end encryption, it could mean 70% of these vital reports are lost.  In October, Facebook boss Mark Zuckerberg said the increased risk of child abuse ""weighed heavily"" on him when considering the company's end-to-end encryption plan.  A  BBC News investigation last year  found encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals. But WhatsApp boss  Will Cathcart has previously posted on Hacker News : ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day."" And Jo O'Reilly, digital privacy advocate at ProPrivacy, said many users would probably welcome Facebook's plans.  ""It will make it significantly less likely that hackers will be able to intercept messages, going a long way to protect users from phishing and cyber-stalking,"" she said. ""It is the kind of of decisive action users will be looking for to reassure them that their private conversations really are private in the wake of privacy scandals."" 'Moral responsibility' But Chief Constable Simon Bailey, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for child protection, said end-to-end encryption would make catching criminals tougher.  ""If Facebook proceed with their current plans, they will knowingly put the safety of children at risk - ignoring the warnings of police, charities and experts across the world,"" he said. ""There is a moral responsibility on them to ensure this does not happen.""  And NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless said: ""Facebook may be happy to shut their eyes to abuse but they can't close their ears to this unanimous concern shown by international experts. ""In its current form, encryption would breach Facebook's duty of care for children so the UK government must ensure a new regulator has the power to hold them financially and criminally accountable.

Full encryption involves converting data into code so it is impossible to access without a password.  Apple was working on the feature in secret about two years ago,  according to Reuters , which broke the news.  But some suggest an alternative explanation is concern about users getting locked out of their accounts. At present, Apple can help a subscriber get back data created on a lost, damaged or stolen device, even if they have forgotten their account's credentials, since the company holds a copy of their iCloud encryption key. ""If Apple were to implement end-to-end encryption for iCloud back-ups, there's no might about it - if the customer forgets their password, they would lose access to their data,""  wrote the blogger John Gruber . He noted that chief executive Tim Cook  had given a similar explanation to Der Spiegel in October 2018 , when he had indicated that he believed his firm would ""change this practice"" at some point in the future when data-recovery would be controlled solely via users' devices.  Complex password Reuters spoke to six sources, including former employees at Apple and the FBI.  It said one ex-Apple worker had suggested the firm's legal department had ultimately ""killed"" the plan. ""That person told Reuters the company did not want to risk being attacked by public officials for protecting criminals, sued for moving previously accessible data out of reach of government agencies or used as an excuse for new legislation against encryption,"" the news agency added. Reuters reporter Joseph Menn added that he ""could not determine why exactly Apple"" decided to abandon the encryption project. ""Encrypting data is essential and companies usually offer help and support when protecting data, so this news comes as a shock to me,"" commented Jake Moore, a cyber-security expert at internet security and antivirus company ESET.  ""However, it doesn't mean your back-up and data can't be encrypted.  ""You will still be able to make an encrypted back-up on your home computer and store it there.  ""As always, users should also be reminded that their data needs to be protected with a strong and complex password. ""The balance between law enforcement and tech companies protecting data comes into question quite often.  ""However, this balance is extremely difficult to fine-tune.  ""Typically, users want the easiest route if they care about their data security, so encryption should be handed to them on a plate.""

""Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake, and if Mr Zuckerberg really has a credible plan to protect Facebook's more than two billion users, it's time he let us know what it is."" In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which the National Crime Agency estimates have led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe. Head of online child safety at the NSPCC Tony Stower said: ""It's an absolute scandal that Facebook are actively choosing to provide offenders with a way to hide in the shadows on their platform, seamlessly able to target, groom and abuse children completely undetected.  ""The landmark agreement between the US and UK on accessing data will radically reduce the time it takes for police to get hold of the data they need from tech giants to bring offenders to justice.   ""It should be a hugely important step forward in tackling online child abuse - if tech giants play their part too."" Wire taps There has been some confusion about whether the Cloud Act could force firms such as Facebook to offer so-called back doors to law enforcement. In a series of tweets on the issue,  Facebook's ex-technology officer Alex Stamos attempted to clarify. ""This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it does not grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,"" he wrote. ""Orders for wire taps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments.""  A BBC investigation earlier this year  found that encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals.

encryption|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-56372188|"Microsoft hack: 3,000 UK email servers remain unsecured Published 12 March Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright BBC / Getty Images More than 3,000 UK email servers remain at risk from the global Microsoft Exchange email flaw, officials believe. The National Cyber Security Centre said it estimated 7,000 servers had been affected by the flaw in the UK and only half had been secured. It said malicious software had been detected on 2,300 machines but it had helped businesses remove it. The agency said it was ""vital"" that all affected businesses took action to secure their email servers. The announcement reveals the scale of the problem among UK companies for the first time since the global security flaw emerged last week. Ransomware groups have begun using the flaw to install their malicious programs, the NCSC warned - though there was no evidence of widespread ransomware attacks on UK companies so far. Once installed, ransomware locks away a user's data behind strong encryption, making the computer system unusable. The group then demands payment to unlock it - and if demands are not met, will steal or delete the data. Free-for-all The security flaw affects Microsoft's widely-used Exchange email system , which powers the email of major corporations, small businesses and public bodies worldwide. The NCSC is particularly concerned about small and medium-sized businesses that may not have heard about the issue. Initially, the flaw was being exploited by a hacking group to gain remote access to email servers, from which it could steal sensitive data. But after Microsoft warned the world it had identified the problem, and urged all its users to download the latest security updates, other hacking groups quickly became familiar with the flaw. The result is a widespread free-for-all as multiple hacking groups all try to find unpatched email servers to attack. ""We are working closely with industry and international partners to understand the scale and impact of UK exposure, but it is vital that all organisations take immediate steps to protect their networks,"" NCSC's director for operations Paul Chichester warned. ""While this work is ongoing, the most important action is to install the latest Microsoft updates."" He also urged all organisations to ""familiarise"" themselves with the guidance surrounding ransomware attacks - and to search for any signs of their systems already being compromised. An emerging picture The true scale of this problem is still emerging with thousands of systems vulnerable in the UK alone. What is not yet entirely clear is the overall impact. While many systems are still at risk and thousands had malicious software installed, the number of cases where we know this was actually used to steal emails or lock people out with ransomware is still fairly low.  That may change in the coming days as more reports come in.  What is clear is that multiple hacking groups have piled in to exploit the vulnerability and those working on the defensive side are likely to stay busy for some time to come.

Gary McGeown, 34, of Belfast Road, in Newry, County Down, appeared at court in Newry via video-link. He is facing a number of drugs charges as well as a charge of converting criminal property. Deputy District Judge Trevor Browne refused bail, stating that it is ""too dangerous"" to consider at this time. The court heard that the charges arise from a search of Mr McGeown's business premises on Tuesday. Prosecution barrister Robin Steer told the court that during the search of a trailer containing ceramic tiles, police found bags of suspected cannabis.  Some of the bags were found in what were described as ""hides"" inside the tile boxes.  The prosecution said that there were also empty boxes with hides found in the haulage yard. A search of Mr McGeown's home was also conducted.  A police officer told the court that during this search, three chargers for what police believe was an encrypted phone were found. A phone was not found. The court heard that data obtained by French authorities had been passed to the National Crime Agency (NCA) and subsequently to the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) which they believe connects Mr McGeown to the use of an encrypted phone. The prosecution objected to bail stating that their main concern is the potential ""obstruction of the police investigation"". 'Nothing to hide' A defence barrister said that Mr McGeown had co-operated fully during interview.  He said that he had answered every question put to him and  ""had exhibited the actions of a man with nothing to hide"". The defence barrister added: ""In terms of interfering with the investigation, the police already have everything.  ""He has given them access to CCTV and passcodes for phones.  ""He has nothing to do with the contents of the trailer."" However, Deputy District Judge Trevor Browne refused bail stating that it is ""too dangerous at this stage to consider bail"".

By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter  Published 6 October 2019 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Home Secretary Priti Patel co-signed an open letter to Facebook Governments in the UK, US and Australia have asked Facebook,  in an open letter , to roll back plans to bring end-to-end encryption to all of its platforms. Facebook, rocked by privacy scandals, responds that everyone has the right to a private conversation. It is the latest in an age-old battle between privacy and safety, which has played out between governments and tech firms ever since digital communication became mass market. What is end-to-end encryption? As the name suggests, this is a secure way of sending information so that only the intended receiver can read it. The information is encrypted while it is still on the sender's device and is only decrypted when it reaches the person intended. Nobody, not even the platform owner, has the keys to unlock it. It was introduced partly as a response to National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden's revelations that the intelligence services in the UK and US had many ways to intercept communication and were doing so on a mass scale. Facebook encryption threatens safety - ministers WhatsApp hack: Is any app or computer truly secure? Why has this become an issue now? The UK and the US have just signed an historic agreement to give each other a much faster way of getting hold of private conversations - cutting down the process time from months or years, to weeks or days. But that agreement could potentially be rendered a bit useless, if they cannot read the scrambled messages. Is there evidence encryption has hampered police enquiries? When the BBC asked the Home Office to provide examples, it could not do so. The real issue is the fact that Facebook will no longer be able to police its own content, it said. It pointed to the fact that last year Facebook sent 12 million reports of child exploitation or abuse to the US's National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, and it would no longer be able to do this if it had encryption on all its platforms. It is something that Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg addressed directly in a Q&A with staff about the issue. ""When we decided to go to end-to-end encryption across the different apps, this is one of the things that just weighed the most heavily on me,"" he said. ""There is more stuff on basically being able to identify patterns of activity, especially around sharing child pornography, and things like this that are just terrible, that I think you can probably find through patterns of activity and that we are going to ramp up investment of,"" he added. He was keen to point out that the fact there was so much child abuse imagery reported via Facebook did not indicate that Messenger, the name of Facebook's direct messaging service, was the preferred platform for it, more that Facebook had become very good at finding it and sending it on. Would it be easy for Facebook to give police a backdoor? ""A backdoor is rather like leaving a key under the mat - once someone knows it is there anyone can walk in,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert at the University of Surrey and a consultant to Europol. His words were echoed by human rights pressure group  Amnesty International in its response . ""Proposals for a 'backdoor' have repeatedly been shown to be unworkable. There is no middle ground: if law enforcement is allowed to circumvent encryption, then anybody can,"" it said. Governments could also ask the social network to change the technical architecture of its platforms so messages could be decrypted when they reached the server. But that would signal a return to days of mass surveillance, thinks Prof Woodward. ""It's exactly what we had before Snowden's revelations and the reaction of the service providers was to introduce end-to-end encryption such that they could not disclose either the key or the decrypted message even if compelled to by law. The laws of mathematics currently trump the law of the land."" And, of course, there is good old-fashioned policing - if the police request data from WhatsApp, they do get IP addresses, phone numbers and contact lists which could be useful in piecing together evidence, even without the full messages Related Topics Facebook Encryption WhatsApp More on this story Facebook encryption threatens safety - ministers Published 4 October 2019 Child abuse images being traded via apps Published 19 February 2019"

That is the message of the UK's Integrated Review, which says the government's aim is for the country to become an innovation ""superpower"" by 2030. ""This will be essential in gaining economic, political and security advantages in the coming decade,"" it says. It marks a major strategic shift in thinking. But delivery will not be straightforward. US v China A global tech race is heating up.  China this month announced its latest five-year plan, including significant increases in research and development spending. It highlighted seven areas including: artificial intelligence (AI) quantum information brain science semiconductors biotechnology neuroscience aerospace The Biden administration, meanwhile, is focusing on maintaining America's edge. image copyright Getty Images image caption The ability to make the latest computer chips is one of both the US and China's key tech strategies A report this month led by former Google chief executive Eric Schmidt focused on the security risks of falling behind China in AI. Strategic advantage Wars of the future may involve AI algorithms battling each other. The first nation to master this and other technologies may not just have a significant military advantage on the battlefield, but also in protecting its people at home and in spurring economic growth.  That is why the UK's review says its ""first goal"" is growing the UK's science and technology power ""in pursuit of strategic advantage"". ""We need to generate strength through technological innovation,"" former MI6 Chief Alex Younger told the BBC. More cyber-attacks Some of this focuses on traditional areas. At least Â£6.6bn of defence funding over the next four years will go on research and development.  Some of this will support industries in particular regions of the UK - a sign of the fusing of security and economic priorities.  In addition, a national space strategy will be launched, as well as a new cyber-strategy that could see more frequent use of offensive capabilities by the new National Cyber Force.  UK investment will be dwarfed by China and the US. But the ambition is that a more activist, industrial policy can create ""thriving ecosystems"" in crucial areas.  Gene-edited troops Three fields are picked out for case studies. One is quantum computing, where the review argues the UK is ""well placed to emerge as a global leader"".  The much-heralded quantum breakthrough will offer major advantages to those who get there first. This includes one field governments do not talk about: breaking the encryption which keeps messages secret. image copyright Getty Images image caption A quantum computer could theoretically unscramble many of today's encrypted communications Another is engineering biology - the design and redesign of biological systems through techniques like gene editing.  This has potential for health and environmental benefits but also, as the report notes, defence and security.  US intelligence officials have suggested China was exploring gene-editing its soldiers to improve their performance. The third is AI. The UK is home to cutting-edge research. But critics also say it highlights some of the historic problems in commercialising domestic innovation.  London-based DeepMind is world-class, but sold itself to Google. The US may be a close ally, but there are still officials who believe the shift of ownership represented a strategic loss. Revolving door The failure to take UK research and grow tech giants from it is not a new problem.  The UK built the first semi-programmable computer in World War Two to break codes at Bletchley Park.  But it did so in secret and the computing industry it led to has been limited in terms of scale. By contrast the US, with a revolving door between government and the private sector, massive investment from the Pentagon and spy agencies, and a larger domestic market, created Silicon Valley. There is also a question about where it will be practical to try to convince what is a highly international workforce at UK companies and universities, to work on defence and security-related projects. In the US, a staff revolt led Google to pull out of Project Maven which wanted to use AI to tag objects in drone-collected video.  Other US companies have been more willing to work with the Pentagon. image copyright Reuters image caption Microsoft and Amazon both bid for the Pentagon's AI-focused Jedi contract But copying the military-civil fusion that China talks about may not be either desirable or possible. Lessons from Huawei One criticism of the review is that it tries to have it both ways with China - stressing the need to be open to Beijing for trade and investment, while also engaging in systemic competition.  This is not always easy. Last year's decision to effectively kick out Huawei from 5G telecoms showed hard choices are sometimes involved. In areas like 5G, the focus today is not just on developing cutting-edge technology, but also in setting global standards and rules for the future. And here China has invested heavily. The UK will need to work hard with allies to catch up and convince other countries to share its vision.   That is just one of the areas where becoming a science and tech superpower may be a tough promise to deliver on.

encryption|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-46463029|"Australia data encryption laws explained Published 7 December 2018 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Australian police can now order tech firms to access the encrypted messages of suspects Australia has passed controversial laws designed to compel technology companies to grant police and security agencies access to encrypted messages. The government says the laws, a world first, are necessary to help combat terrorism and crime. However critics have listed wide-ranging concerns, including that the laws could undermine the overall security and privacy of users.  The laws were rushed through parliament on its final day of the year. The Labor opposition said it had reluctantly supported the laws to help protect Australians during the Christmas period, but on Friday it said that ""legitimate concerns"" about them remained. Cyber-security experts have warned the laws could now create a ""global weak point"" for companies such as Facebook and Apple. Why are encrypted messages an issue? Australia already has laws which require providers to hand over a suspect's communication to police.  This may already be possible if a service provider uses a form of encryption that allows them to view a user's message. But in recent years, services such as WhatsApp, Signal and others have added an additional layer of security known as end-to-end encryption. FBI says device encryption is 'a huge problem' Geeks v government: The battle over public key cryptography End-to-end encryption allows only the sender and recipient to view a message, preventing it from being unscrambled by the service provider.  Australia and other countries have said that terrorists and criminals exploit this technology to avoid surveillance. How would this change work? It differs from laws in China, Russia and Turkey, where services offering end-to-end encryption are banned. Under Australia's legislation, police can force companies to create a technical function that would give them access to encrypted messages without the user's knowledge. image copyright EPA image caption Only two MPs, Adam Bandt and Andrew Wilkie (left), voted against the bill ""This ensures that our national security and law enforcement agencies have the modern tools they need, with appropriate authority and oversight, to access the encrypted conversations of those who seek to do us harm,"" Attorney-General Christian Porter said. However, cyber-security experts say it's not possible to create a ""back door"" decryption that would safely target just one person.  ""Any vulnerability would just weaken the existing encryption scheme, affecting security overall for innocent people,"" said Dr Chris Culnane from the University of Melbourne. Such a ""security hole"" could then be abused or exploited by criminals, he said.  In a bid to address these concerns, Australia's law offers a safeguard which says decryptions won't go ahead if they create a ""systemic weakness"". However critics say the definition of ""systemic weakness"" is vague, meaning it is unclear how it may be applied.  What are the other concerns? Digital rights advocates are highly critical of Australia's move, saying it lacks sufficient checks and balances. The Electronic Frontier Foundation has said police could order individual IT developers to create technical functions without their company's knowledge. ""This has the potential for Australian tech firms to have no clue whether they were even subject to an order,"" the foundation's Nate Cardozo told the BBC. There is also criticism over how fast the laws were passed.  A draft bill was presented only in August. A parliamentary committee examining the legislation did not release its report until late on Wednesday.  Labor initially proposed 173 amendments to the bill, but agreed to drop them on Thursday so that the law would be passed this year. In return, the government pledged to debate possible amendments next year. But the nation's top legal society, the Law Council of Australia, said on Friday that the laws had been ""rammed"" through the parliament with inadequate consideration. What does it mean for tech firms? If companies don't comply with the laws, they risk being fined.  That's led to speculation that some global firms which have vocally opposed the laws could withdraw from the Australian market. However, Dr Culnane said that most companies are likely to comply - partly because users won't be aware if their messages have been accessed. However, experts say the full implications are unclear and much uncertainty remains. Some firms have already suggested that they may not be subject to Australian law. Experts add that, given the debate involves national security, many aspects may play out behind closed doors. We are following the Australian  #AAbill  closely.

encryption|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-55222499|"Encrypted messaging puts children at risk, commissioner warns Published 8 December 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption By age 12, 90% of children use an online messaging app - despite a 13+ age requirement Encryption of online messages could make it harder to police child abuse and grooming online, the children's commissioner for England has warned.  End-to-end encryption is a privacy feature that makes it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to read messages sent online. Commissioner Anne Longfield said it also prevented police from gathering evidence to prosecute child abusers. But digital rights groups see it as an essential part of online privacy. Facebook, which is behind the most popular messaging apps children use, already offers end-to-end encryption for Whatsapp.  It has added an opt-in version to its Messenger service, with plans to make it the default for all its platforms. That could include Instagram, which does not yet have it. Messaging strangers Ms Longfield's warning came as she launched a new report looking at how children used online messaging apps. It found the vast majority of children aged eight and over used some sort of messaging service. That includes 60% of eight-year-olds and 90% of 12-year-olds, despite the main such apps having an age restriction of at least 13, if not older. Child protectors urge Facebook encryption rethink Child abuse images being traded via apps More than a third of children surveyed for the report said they had received a message that made them feel uncomfortable. One in 10 talk to strangers online, and one in 20 have shared videos or photos of themselves with strangers. Duty of care Ms Longfield said the report ""shows how vigilant parents need to be, but also how the tech giants are failing to regulate themselves and so are failing to keep children safe"". She is calling on the government to make the big tech firms responsible when it introduces the long-delayed Online Harms Bill, with large fines for companies that breach their ""duty of care"". She has warned against classifying encrypted messaging as ""private communications"". Doing so could offer an exemption for the tech giants on their duty of care, she said. That ""could be a cynical attempt on the part of some tech firms to side-step sanctions and litigation"" she warned. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport responded: ""Children will be at the heart of our new online harms laws with tough sanctions on social media platforms that fail to protect young people from harm. ""We are clear that firms should only implement end-to-end encryption if it can be done without preventing action against child abuse.""  Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced in March 2019 that end-to-end encryption was going to become standard across Facebook's messaging platforms, the criticism of the plan has got ever louder.  Mr Zuckerberg himself has admitted that the move could harm the fight against child abuse. ""You're fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back,"" he told a Facebook staff meeting.  Now the Children's Commissioner has joined those warning of the damaging effects of making messages too secret.  But her broadside may be aimed less at the tech firms than at the government, which she and other critics feel has dragged its heels on the issue of regulating online content.  A year and a half after the publication of  the Online Harms White Paper, there is still no clarity about when it will be turned into law and what sort of sanctions might be in it.  This week saw Labour's Margaret Hodge, a victim of online abuse, call for either an end to anonymity on social media or for directors of the platforms to be made liable for defamatory posts.  The critics' shopping list for measures against the tech giants is getting longer. Meanwhile, ministers must try to work out what is practicable as well as desirable. The commissioner says that end-to-end encryption should not be applied at all to children's accounts, and that tech companies should ""retain the ability to scan for child sexual abuse material"". ""It's time for the government to show it hasn't lost its nerve and that it is prepared to stand up to the powerful internet giants, who are such a big part in our children's lives,"" she said. media caption What is encryption? Digital rights organisations, however, have long argued that encryption is essential. The Open Rights Group  accuses the government of using the Online Harms Bill to weaken security for everyone, warning that a ban on encryption ""would create a degree of surveillance and government intrusion that simply should not be tolerated in a democratic society"". The  Electronic Frontier Foundation , meanwhile, says encryption ""is one of the most powerful tools individuals have for maintaining their digital privacy and security in an increasingly insecure world"". Facebook, as the owner of three messaging apps, said that child exploitation has ""no place on our platforms"" and that it has been ""developing news ways"" to prevent and detect abuse. But it remains in favour of encryption, with added anti-abuse features. ""End-to-end encryption is already the leading technology used by many services to keep people safe"", a spokesman said. ""Through a combination of advanced technology and user reports, WhatsApp bans around 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery.""

The agency has  published a paper , Ethics of AI: Pioneering a New National Security, saying the technology will be put at the heart of its operations. And officials say it will help analysts spot patterns hidden inside large - and fast growing - amounts of data.  This could include: trying to spot fake online messages used by other states spreading disinformation mapping international networks engaged in human or drug trafficking finding child sex abusers hiding their identities online But it cannot predict human behaviour such as moving towards executing a terrorist attack.

After its first announcement in January,  millions of users downloaded apps from WhatsApp's competitors. The Facebook-owned platform previously said it had been the victim of ""misinformation"" around the change. But WhatsApp now says it has ""reflected"" on how it could have explained the changes better. The phrasing of the warning in the initial push  led to widespread fears that it was going to share large amounts of WhatsApp data with Facebook.  In reality, very little had changed in that area - and almost all users had previously accepted the type of data sharing involved. As part of its second attempt to convince users, WhatsApp will begin displaying a banner alert within the app in the coming weeks. image copyright Whatsapp image caption The in-app banner will lead to more detailed explanations for users It encourages users to learn more about the update and what is - and is not - changing. Messages informing users of the update will also be displayed in the status section of the app. The new terms are scheduled to come into effect on 15 May. Down to business WhatsApp says  the data it shares with its parent company does not include messages, groups or call logs.   Instead, it says the new terms focus on changes to allow users to message businesses.  WhatsApp already shares information with Facebook, such as your IP address and information about your phone, as well as purchases made via the platform.  However this does not apply in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist.   But privacy experts say the saga highlights how unaware users are of how their data is being used. ""In its efforts to clarify that [it] isn't doing anything wrong, Whatsapp has in fact inadvertently highlighted that it was already harvesting huge amounts of data for Facebook,"" said Ray Walsh, a digital privacy expert at ProPrivacy. That ""vindicates"" those who decided to leave Whatsapp, he said. ""The biggest takeaway from all of this is that Whatsapp was already harvesting device level identifiers, IP addresses, and purchase info on behalf of Facebook - and that until recent media attention, the general public was largely unaware."" Signal messaging service restored after outage US regulators open privacy probes into tech giants Whatsapp said it had ""reflected on what we could have done better here"". âWe want everyone to know our history of defending end-to-end encryption, and trust weâre committed to protecting peopleâs privacy and security."" It also said it will ""be doing much more"" to be clear about changes in the future. In January, government officials in India asked the messaging giant to withdraw its planned changes.

From there, the young victims were not only enticed into sharing sexualised images of themselves but in some cases blackmailed to commit abuse by proxy on their younger siblings. How was David Wilson - the man behind the teenage girl mask - eventually caught? David Wilson, a roofer who lived at his mother's Norfolk home, was ""one of the most prolific offenders"" the National Crime Agency (NCA) had ever come across. From his bedroom in Kirstead in King's Lynn, the 36-year-old built a web of false personas to target thousands of children both in the UK and abroad. At Ipswich Crown Court on Wednesday, Wilson was  sentenced to 25 years for 96 child sex offences . As many as 500 victims sent him images. One of them told the BBC how they felt ""trapped inside his game"". And yet the first concerns about Wilson's behaviour came not from the victims themselves, or from police intelligence - but from a Facebook algorithm. Those involved in bringing him to justice now fear whether  Facebook plans to use end-to-end encryption  might mean people like Wilson might evade justice in the future. The crimes image caption Wilson blackmailed and coerced his victims, said National Crime Agency director Rob Jones Wilson's modus operandi was deception and blackmail. He created fake personas of young girls and then used pre-paid mobile telephones to target boys, the majority of whom were aged between 11 and 13 years old, via social media. ""Once he made contact, he coerced those children to abuse themselves or others and produce images of that abuse,"" said Rob Jones, director of the National Crime Agency.  ""As soon as Wilson established a relationship he would incite and blackmail and really try to establish control over that child by threatening them to a whole range of different tactics which were designed to allow him to control the child to commit abuse and and to victimise other children."" Once he had a compromising image of a child, Wilson would then use it to blackmail the victim into sending increasingly extreme imagery of themselves or, in some cases, to commit sexual abuse - or ""contact offending by proxy"" - on their siblings. One of his victims was just four years old. ""It is happening in people's homes - created by people like Wilson, who is able to do it remotely because of access to social media platforms and the use of false personas,"" said Mr Jones. The case against him involved 51 boys. But officers unearthed hundreds of victims who had been lured into sending images of themselves by Wilson. ""Those he was abusing had no idea who he was,"" said Mr Jones. By the time Wilson was charged, officers had evidence of seven fake female identities, 14 separate social media accounts and five pre-paid mobile telephones.  All had one user - David Wilson. image copyright NCA image caption One of the victims said Wilson continued to increase his abusive behaviour, despite knowing how frightened they were 'I was very, very scared' One of his victims is now 16 years old. He was 11 when he was first contacted by Wilson. ""I was completely unaware of dangerous people online and in the world,"" the boy said. When he set up his social media account he had a number of friends on there - and a girl purporting to be about 12 years old. ""She contacted me and I had a look at her account to see what she looked like. She looked like a normal girl, about my age, and it didn't concern me, and she also talked and approached me in a way that was very normal,"" he said. ""It didn't alarm me so I decided to carry on talking to her thinking it was just a girl my age. Over time, I was attracted to this person who I thought was a pretty young girl, but as it progressed I began to feel very alarmed by the way they started to talk to me. ""I was concerned that this wasn't a girl and I was very scared. I kept on asking him to leave me alone and the only way he would leave me alone was if I sent him indecent images."" In a desperate bid to free himself from Wilson, the boy agreed to send some sexual images of himself. Two years later the boy was approached by a second ""girl"" online. The boy asked her to leave him alone but the ""girl"" refused and said they had indecent images of him from two years ago. ""I was very, very scared,"" the boy said. ""She requested more indecent images and if not [supplied] she would spread it all across the internet, despite knowing I was extremely frightened. ""I was trapped inside his game."" Tony Cook, the NCA's head of child exploitation and online protection, said: ""These children and their families had their lives turned upside down - some of them never recover psychologically. ""I must pay tribute to the bravery of the people who came forward. They've been very patient with us. ""He was getting them to do very, very depraved and degrading acts. ""It doesn't bear thinking about what he was having those children do."" The algorithm image caption Tony Cook described Wilson as ""despicable"" The social media giant Facebook uses an algorithm to ""scan"" messages sent over its platform. ""They are able to detect the type of behaviour in messaging and in the exchange of images which is indicative as the sexual abuse of children,"" said Mr Jones. ""They are really, really good at that."" Intelligence from Facebook was shared with the NCA in 2017 which identified 20 accounts of boys aged between 12 and 15 years old sending indecent images of themselves to an account of a 13-year-old girl. Wilson's case was one of 90 referrals made to the NCA from Facebook, via the US  National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children . From the information from Facebook, detectives were able to put together their case. The IP addresses used to commit the crimes were linked to his mother's home. They had CCTV footage of him buying a top-up voucher for a phone linked to one of his fake accounts. And when he was arrested in August 2017, the telephone used to commit some of the offences was found hidden in his bedroom. But at that stage, the full scale of Wilson's offending remained unclear. Officers wanted to examine evidence from his Snapchat, Google and Instagram accounts too. That involved filing an International Letter of Request to the US authorities. It was nearly two years before the NCA received its data trove from the US. It contained more than 250,000 messages for detectives to pore over. It revealed Wilson's victims lived across the UK, the US and Australia. Could he have been stopped earlier? image copyright NAtional Crime Agency image caption All 96 offences Wilson (pictured at the moment of his fourth arrest) admitted at court in November 2020, happened after he was first arrested by Norfolk Police on 4 April, 2015. By the time Wilson was charged for crimes committed between 2016 and 2020, he had been arrested on four separate occasions. He admitted to all 96 offences at Ipswich Crown Court in November 2020, but all those crimes took place after he was first arrested by Norfolk Police on 4 April 2015. That arrest was connected with two counts of possessing indecent images of children. No action at that stage was taken by police. Responding to the BBC's questions about that first arrest, a spokesperson for Norfolk Constabulary said: ""Officers carried out a search of the property and investigated the matter, however found no evidence to link him to the crimes and consequently no action was taken.  ""Due to ongoing concerns around safeguarding, he was subject to further measures through a multi-agency Local Authority Designated Officer meeting where a referral was made to the Disclosure and Barring Service. ""This meant employers would be informed of the concerns and the Football Association were also made aware as he had connections to children's football."" But it did not stop his offending - not even after the National Crime Agency got involved. The NCA arrested Wilson three times during its three-year investigation - in August 2017, January 2018 and finally in April 2020. ""He continued to offend even when we'd arrested him. And we arrested him three times, so he was a pretty determined individual,"" said Mr Cook of the NCA. ""He's been grooming and preying on very vulnerable young children and getting them to send him very indecent imagery of themselves and doing very degrading acts and then blackmailing them.  ""I don't think you get more despicable than that, do you?"" But the NCA said it was not in a position to charge him before 2020. ""When you're dealing with somebody who has given a fake identification we have to be 100% certain that that person we arrest and charge is the person who is behind the fake identities,"" said Mr Cook. ""That takes a lot of time. It is just one of those things - you've got to piece together the evidence like a jigsaw puzzle until you can prove that the fake identities are linked to David Wilson."" The NCA now feared whether it will be able to bring people like Wilson to justice in the future. Its concerns, the agency said, stem from proposals within Facebook to use end-to-end encryption in its Messenger platform. Mr Jones said had such encryption been in place in 2017 it would have been ""highly unlikely"" Wilson would have been caught. ""Had that content been end-end-encrypted, there is a real risk that justice would not have been served and Wilson would still be abusing victims today,"" he said. A spokesman for Facebook said: ""Facebook has led the industry in developing new ways to prevent, detect, and respond to abuse and we will continue to work with law enforcement to combat criminal activity."" The company told the BBC child exploitation had ""no place"" on its platforms and said it would ""build on"" the ""strong anti-abuse capabilities"" of one of its platforms (WhatsApp) when it rolled out end-to-end encryption in its other messaging services.

Emil Apreda, 33, sent emails from Berlin demanding Â£10m worth of Bitcoin to not carry out the attacks. The National Crime Agency said he made his threats in the spring and summer of 2020 as the NHS struggled with Covid. Senior officers kept the threats from the public for fear of patients being scared into not attending hospitals.  Apreda used encryption techniques and the dark web in an attempt to hide his identity, but police brought in behavioural, linguistics and cyber-crime experts to track him down.  He sent emails to the NHS pretending to be a far-right activist linked to the neo-Nazi group Combat 18, but police believe that was just a ruse to instil fear.  He was finally identified by German detectives and armed officers raided his home in Berlin on 15 June last year.  UK facing 'nasty mix' of threats, says MI5 chief Pandemic 'exposes' UK security planning gaps 'Heightened anxiety' For the first time, the NCA has revealed details of the case, calling it ""one of the most significant threats we've seen for some time"" which took place at a time of ""deep and heightened anxiety"" in the UK.  Tim Court, the NCA's head of investigations, said the content of the emails was ""so threatening and so damaging"" that it was only disclosed to a ""very tight circle of people - and I mean very tight"" within the police and government.  Meanwhile, security at hospitals was quietly stepped up.  Mr Court said the risks were both of loss of life and a loss of confidence in the NHS.  ""At the height of this, we were losing nearly nearly 1,000 people a day - and for six weeks we're trying to manage somebody who could have been planting a bomb in a hospital, somewhere in the UK."" A particular concern was that many patients were on ventilators or oxygen at the time, and it would have been more difficult to get them out of a hospital in the event of a credible bomb threat.   The extortion campaign started on 26 April when Apreda sent an email to the NHS, making his demand for Bitcoin and warning that he would send a bomb in a package to a hospital in the UK if he was not paid.  This was followed by an identical email to an NCA control centre, followed by 16 more over six weeks.  During that period, the death of George Floyd in the US and resulting protests in the UK prompted threats from him to blow up Black Lives Matter demonstrations.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Threats were also made against Black Lives Matter protests Finally, as the fourth anniversary of the murder of Labour MP Jo Cox by a far-right activist approached, he emailed that he would kill MPs - but did not name any. Police behavioural and linguistics experts drew up a profile of the extortionist, who they decided was not from the UK.  Police say further ""technical leads"" pointed to Germany. He was finally identified by LKA, the German CID. image copyright PA image caption Jo Cox was the Labour MP for Batley and Spen Apreda had been issuing deadlines for payment after which he said he would attack, so the day before the anniversary of Ms Cox's death, German police moved in, blowing open the front door of his Berlin flat and arresting him.  Police say he has background in computing, but they have discovered no links to Combat 18, despite his claims.  The far-right group has been active in the UK in the past, but now exists mainly in the US and Germany. Apreda was charged and convicted of extortion in Germany, but the NCA said he could have faced terrorism charges if he had been brought to the UK.  The NCA  said he had no links that they could find with Britain, and therefore extraditing him had not been possible. It denied Brexit had been a major factor.

Cardiff Crown Court heard he thought he was sending hundreds of images to his girlfriend over the course of a year. But they were in fact sent to Darren Hart, 29, from Glasgow, who has been jailed for eight-and-a-half years. Hart, who pleaded guilty to 10 charges of sex offences, befriended the boy through online gaming, then created a fake persona.  Prosecution barrister Matthew Roberts told the court the boy was told he had to send the images because the woman had been captured in America and ""was being held by a gang who would hurt and rape her if he didn't do what was being demanded of him"". The court heard the boy's parents removed computer devices from him after concerns were raised at school and indecent images were found on them. But his abuser Hart, managed to send him an internet-enabled mobile phone so he could continue sending the extreme images, which were sent through multiple encrypted social media accounts to the fictitious girlfriend. 'Shocking' scale of online child abuse Siblings targeted in ânew online grooming trendâ Warrants uncover '160,000 child images' Mr Roberts said the boy had been ""totally brainwashed by the defendant"" into making hundreds of images and videos of sexual acts of ""extreme self-harming at the direction of the defendant"". Hart was arrested while on his way, with his stepfather, to meet the boy in south Wales and to ""remove him for sexual purposes to Scotland"" without the knowledge of his parents.  Hart's phone had 364 images and 192 videos of the boy along with a note containing a ""shopping list of requirements"" of acts for the boy to carry out.  Family's 'horror' The court heard that the boy saw his family as ""the enemy"", although their relationship had been repaired recently.  In a victim impact statement, the boy's father told the court of his ""horror that this abuse could be carried out anonymously from behind a keyboard"".  He added: ""I shudder at what happened and what could have happened if the defendant had succeeded in taking away my son"".  The boy said he had hundreds of physical scars as a result and had carried out the acts because he felt that his girlfriend was ""in peril and danger"". He added that he felt he had lost a lot of his childhood and found it hard to trust people. Defence barrister Susan Ferrier told the court that Darren Hart had an ""introverted character"" with no history of offending.  She said that was a ""lonely man who struggled with his mental health"" and who had been in a secret relationship with his stepfather since he was 18.  She said the offending had occurred in a gap in that relationship. He pleaded guilty to 10 charges of sexual offences at an earlier hearing. Recorder Timothy Brennan said Darren Hart had committed ""multiple offences over a long period by cruel deception"" and that the case was ""so astonishing, were it not known to be true, it would be difficult to believe"".  He said Hart had shown an inability to realise how serious the offences were and that there was a ""significant risk"" of further offending. Hart was sentenced to eight-and-a half years in prison with an extended period of four years on licence. He must also comply with a sexual harm prevention order indefinitely.

Encryption scrambles messages so that if they're intercepted while being delivered they cannot be read.  Most messaging services use a level of encryption, but there are different types. Twitter, Instagram and Snapchat are other services that don't use end-to-encryption. Facebook Messenger encrypts messages by default from the sender to its server, and then encrypts them again between the server and the recipient.  End-to-end encryption, used by WhatsApp, doesn't have the stop in between.  media caption What is encryption? Usually the only people with the 'key' to decipher an end-to-end encrypted message are the sender and the intended recipient.  The messaging service can't read the message. It's particularly useful for sending sensitive information like bank details, which you wouldn't want to fall into the wrong hands or be stored anywhere online. The reason some are arguing it's a bad thing There's been a big discussion about end-to-end encryption and the problems it causes for policing.  Khalid Masood accessed WhatsApp moments before he killed four people in the Westminster terror attack. He also used iMessage and SMS. After the attack, Home Secretary Amber Rudd called it ""completely unacceptable"" that the security services couldn't access some of the content - and said ""there should be  no place for terrorists to hide "". At the time, a WhatsApp spokeswoman said the company was ""horrified at the attack"" and was co-operating with the investigation. But since then, Amber Rudd has repeated her call for messaging services to work more closely with government to stop criminals misusing apps. image caption Chats on WhatsApp are encrypted end-to-end by default Whatsapp, which is owned by Facebook,  added end-to-end  encryption by default in 2016, with Facebook saying that protecting private communication was one of its ""core beliefs"". But its native Facebook Messenger doesn't have the same levels of security.  You have to specifically enable something called ""secret conversation"" within the Messenger app in order for your conversations to have end-to-end encryption. image copyright BBC/Facebook image caption Enabling end-to-encryption on Facebook Messenger Facebook-owned Instagram does not use end-to-end encryption on the photo-sharing app, which introduced private messaging in 2013. Twitter doesn't either, while there's nothing on Snapchat's website to suggest messages on the app are completely encrypted. Its support page does say that most messages are deleted from its servers after a maximum 30 days. And Skype, which also has no information on end-to-end encryption on its website, has been trialling a ""private conversation"" option with some users. Newsbeat has contacted Snapchat and Skype for clarification. So what does use end-to-end encryption? Well, as mentioned above the main player in end-to-end encrypted messaging is WhatsApp, but Apple also uses it. Its 'approach to privacy' document says it ""uses end-to-end encryption to protect your iMessage and FaceTime conversations"" across all devices. But Apple also allows users to send messages as a text if the iMessage won't go through, and text messages are not end-to-end encrypted.  A lot of messaging services, like iMessage, allow you to back up to the cloud, which gives those cloud services access to your messages.  Follow Newsbeat on  Instagram ,  Facebook  and  Twitter .

Amber Rudd said technology companies were not doing enough to beat âthe enemyâ on the internet.  Encryption tools used by messaging apps had become a âproblemâ, she added. Ms Rudd is meeting with representatives from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and others at a counter-terrorism forum in San Francisco. Tuesdayâs summit is the first gathering of the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism, an organisation set up by the major companies in the wake of recent terror attacks. In a joint statement,  the companies taking part said  they were co-operating to âsubstantially disrupt terrorists' ability to use the internet in furthering their causes, while also respecting human rightsâ.  WhatsApp must not be 'place for terrorists to hide' Euro MPs back end-to-end encryption for all citizens Australian PM seeks access to encrypted messages Ms Rudd is expected to tell companies that extremists should not be allowed to upload content at all. ""Thatâs what weâre really trying to achieve,"" she told the BBC. ""What [technology companies] have been saying to us is using artificial intelligence, theyâre beginning to make progress in that way.â  Privacy rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation has expressed concern about the possibility of heavy-handed blocking of content.  It said such a move would have a significant impact on free speech online. Encryption - a common feature of business and personal communications - was ""the duct-tape that holds the internet together"", said Ross Anderson, cryptography expert at the University of Cambridge. He added that he was worried authorities and Silicon Valley firms were making an agreement behind closed doors that would ultimately undermine security. End-to-end In recent years, messaging services, including Facebook, Apple, and Google, have adopted end-to-end encryption, an added layer of complexity that makes it almost impossible for messages to be accessed without a userâs permission. The measure has been heralded by the technology companies as a vital tool for privacy. But authorities around the world say end-to-end encryption has created unreachable parts of the internet. media caption What is encryption? Ms Rudd told the BBC that the UK government supported encryption, with caveats. ""We support its place in making sure that we have secure facilities in our daily lives,â the home secretary said. ""However, there is a problem in terms of the growth of end-to-end encryption. ""Itâs a problem for the security services and for police who are not, under the normal way, under properly warranted paths, able to access that information. âWe want [technology companies] to work more closely with us on end-to-end encryption, so that where there is particular need, where there is targeted need, under warrant, they share more information with us so that we can access it.â She said companies should give up more metadata about messages being sent via their services.  Metadata refers to information about a conversation - such as who took part, when and for how long - but not the contents itself. When pressed on what kind of metadata she wanted, she replied: âIâm having those conversations in private.â Technology companies are likely to resist any action that would result in them being seen to be sharing too much data with governments.  In an  interview with BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs  programme, Facebook's chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, warned about pushing criminals into even harder to reach parts of the internet.

Several apps encrypt communications end-to-end, which stop messages being legible if intercepted by criminals or law enforcement. In a speech, Rod Rosenstein said law enforcers were increasingly thwarted by such encryption. He met Home Secretary Amber Rudd on Thursday to discuss the issue. He will also meet the head of the UK's GCHQ intelligence agency. ""Increasingly, the tools we use to collect evidence run up against encryption tools which are designed to defeat them,"" said Mr Rosenstein, speaking at the Global Cyber Security Summit in London. media caption What is encryption? He said the United States was ""co-ordinating with our foreign partners as to what the challenges are"". With end-to-end encryption, messages are scrambled when they leave the sender's device and are decrypted only on the receiver's device. It means service providers such as WhatsApp cannot hand over a legible copy of a suspect's messages to law enforcement, because they do not have one. Mr Rosenstein said technology companies often ""resisted co-operating with governments"". Ms Rudd has also described encryption tools used by messaging apps as a ""problem"". In August, she met representatives from Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and others at a counter-terrorism forum in San Francisco.

The Harris Federation, which runs 50 primary and secondary academies in and around London, said it had temporarily disabled email while it deals with the cyber-attack. Data on the systems has been encrypted and hidden by the attackers. Last week, the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) issued a warning that hackers are targeting schools. 'Sophisticated attack' âWe are at least the fourth multi-academy trust to have been targeted in March,â  a statement on the Harris Federation website  said.  âThis is a highly sophisticated attack that will have a significant impact on our academies but it will take time to uncover the exact details of what has or has not happened, and to resolve. âAs a precaution, we have temporarily disabled our email system.â Any devices which the Harris Federation have given to pupils have also been disabled, the statement added.  However, schools have recently returned to in-person learning as part of the easing of lockdown restrictions - meaning students can still attend classes. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Harris Federation schools break up for Easter later this week. Its statement did not detail what information or data has been compromised, and it has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. The trust is working with âa specialised firm of cyber-technology consultantsâ, the National Crime Agency and the NCSC to resolve the issues. The NCSC said it has ""recently alerted the education sector to the significant threat posed by ransomware attacks"" and urged schools and colleges to follow its advice to protect themselves online. It used to be the case that ransomware groups concentrated their efforts on large multinational companies. Big corporate budgets and potential business interruption mean large ransom payouts. Publicly funded schools and colleges are therefore an odd and particularly cruel target. One hacker group recently posted part of their negotiation conversation with another unnamed institution on the dark net. It made for grim reading, and once again showed me how ruthless they are. At one stage, when the hackers demanded $15m, the school wrote: ""Sir, please, this is NOT a business with profits. We operate much like a charity operates. This is a state-funded school, our salaries are paid for by taxing the people that live in the state. We have no idea how you think we can afford this.""

By Alex Taylor BBC Entertainment reporter Published 3 days ago Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Getty Images image caption Singer Beyonce Knowles, actor Rami Malek and front man Axl Rose have all attempted to control their online image ""I would really appreciate if you take that down. I'm a really private person."" Actress Rachel Bilson has recalled her surprise on receiving this message from old school friend and fellow film star Rami Malek after she had posted online a throwback picture of the pair.  Speaking on Dax Shepard's Armchair Expert podcast , she said she had shared the ""super-nerdy"" picture - taken on a school trip - in light-hearted support for Malek just before he won the Oscar for his role as Freddie Mercury in 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody. Bilson believed he would appreciate the gesture as ""good friends"". But Malek didn't react as anticipated. A week later Bilson received a blunt direct message asking for the picture to be removed.  She said that despite taking it straight down and sending him an apology, she was ""super-bummed"" at how it harmed their relationship.  ""I wrote to him, a really nice message, like, 'I'm so sorry. Go get the Oscar, you're doing amazing.' And I never [heard] anything back,"" she said. ""I'm a big fan of not taking yourself seriously, especially at that level of fame and talent. But look, he wants to be super-respected, it's his thing, so I respected it."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Bilson said she never heard again from Malek after the Instagram exchange The exchange highlights the delicacy of posting old photos on social media without permission - particularly those that counter our present-day identities, says Brett Cullen, head of social media at Hatch PR.  He says that while throwback photos have long been popular on social media - from Facebook's memories function to the #ThrowbackThursday hashtag - it's important to remember that we're ""not all comfortable looking backwards"", so it's always wise to get consent.  ""Although a lot of people may share happy memories or photos of them goofing around at school because they want to remind themselves of positive feelings or to show the world proof that they are a certain type of character, others simply aren't,"" he says.  And this is especially true when talking about a public figure such as Malek.   ""Celebrities have finely crafted public images and social media is an important part of making or breaking that. There's a strategy behind why celebrities do what they do (or don't), particularly on social.  ""Something coming out of the blue in an uncontrolled manner, bringing up something from the past which doesn't align with that strategy can present a challenge and a risk,"" says Cullen.   image copyright Kevin Winter image caption Rami Malek won the Oscar for best actor for his performance as Freddie Mercury in 2018's Bohemian Rhapsody ""Malek could have felt that the photo shared didn't represent his brand and didn't want to negatively impact on that. Having a strong brand can bring so many benefits beyond securing roles, there's wider commercial opportunities at play.  ""Keeping control of that image, and the narrative of the brand, is therefore crucial for celebrities,"" he says. But just as it's become more important, it's also increasingly complicated in the age of the internet and social media. Here are other notable examples of stars who have fought to maintain control of their image. Beyonce's Super Bowl controversy (2013) The success of Beyonce's 2013 Super Bowl performance was also marred by online controversy. Soon after the show finished, the singer's team became unhappy with some of the photos circulating and  her publicist attempted to limit their spread .  ""There are some unflattering photos on your current feed that we are respectfully asking you to change,"" said an email to Buzzfeed. The request backfired. Not only did the website refuse, it published the exchange in an article titled ""The 'Unflattering' Photos BeyoncÃ©'s Publicist Doesn't Want You To See."" image copyright Reuters image caption A more flattering picture of Beyonce from the recent Grammy Awards And while a similar request to Getty Images did see the photo agency remove the originals from its library, this did nothing to stem the circulation of those already bought and published. The case stands as an example of the so-called Streisand Effect. Named after singer Barbra Streisand's efforts to supress pictures of her Malibu home in 2003, it refers to attempts to hide or remove information unintentionally having the reverse effect and spark greater spread. The perils of the Streisand effect Social media consultant Matt Navarra says that increasingly celebrities who think they can ""control"" conversations about themselves on social media platforms find themselves sorely mistaken. ""In 2021, the sheer volume of posts, comments and clips shared publicly is colossal,"" he explains. ""A lot of the conversations and sharing of content between friends happens in private messages and encrypted chat groups, out of reach of even the most determined agent seeking to protect a star's online persona. ""The rise of platforms like TikTok and Instagram Stories means everyone is a creator. Nowadays, we all have access to easy-to-use yet incredibly powerful tools to discover, edit, and share content in an instant.  ""Once something about a celebrity is shared or discussed online, they are at the mercy of algorithms and memes - a potent combination far greater than the will of any celeb publicity team."" Axl Rose's meme battle (2016) One celebrity to learn the power of meme culture is Guns N' Roses front man Axl Rose.  When the '80s rock icons  reunited for various tours throughout the 2010s , the singer, once known as a youthful rock pin-up but now in his 50s, fell victim to a slew of memes based on a photo of him looking noticeably sweatier and rounder-faced onstage. In an effort to wrestle back some sense of control, he issued takedown requests demanding that Google remove the now infamous photo associated with the ""fat Axl Rose"" meme from its search engines. He argued that under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, the image - taken at a 2010 concert in Canada by Boris Minkevich and published in the Winnipeg Free Press - was his own intellectual property and therefore needed his approval and consent to be shared. image copyright Robert Cianflone image caption Rose on stage during a different performance in 2010 Rose even hired intellectual property registry Web Sheriff to get the photo taken offline. It argued Minkevich never had any right to publish or post the photograph since he had signed a waiver before the concert. Stolen celebrity nudes prompt changes at 4Chan Minkevich said he was unable to remember six years on. ""Either way, the photo was stolen off our website with no permission granted by the Winnipeg Free Press,"" he told reporters.  Ultimately Rose's efforts were in vain. The meme was out of the bottle. Emily Ratajkowski speaks out against photo-editing (2017) But just as the internet has seen celebrities sometimes lose control of their image, social media can also empower - offering a platform for stars to dictate narratives in previously unprecedented ways. In 2017, US model Emily Ratajkowski used her Instagram account to call out French magazine Madame Figaro for altering her cover shoot photos in post-production.                   View this post on Instagram                         A post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) ""I, like so many of us, try every day to work past those insecurities. I was extremely disappointed to see my lips and breasts altered in Photoshop on this cover,"" she wrote alongside a comparison post of the original stills and final cover. Activist and actress Jameela Jamil similarly spoke out against the practice two years later. ""It made me so mentally unwell trying to live up to this image in person. Airbrushing is the DEVIL,"" she said in an Instagram  post analysing an old press shot . ""Social media has definitely allowed women to fight back against harmful, reality-skewing practices such as airbrushing and filtering imagery,"" says Sara McCorquodale, author of Influence: How Social Media Influencers Are Shaping Our Digital Future. image copyright Getty Images image caption Actress Jameela Jamil has used her platform on social media to call for body positivity ""Celebrities such as Jamil and Ratajkowski have brilliantly held mainstream media to account for this and in the process revealed how little control they have had over their image.""  She says this has been eye-opening for many people and created space for conversations around everything from why women may feel a certain body shape is ""right"" to why we feel like we must hide skin conditions like acne.  However, it's proved a sensitive balance,  fraught with the potential for misinterpretation . ""The irony of course is that so much conversation and activism around this is happening on Instagram - a platform which became popular for making it easier to filter pictures,"" says McCorquodale. ""Filtering is fine if it is the individual's choice, but what we must achieve now is transparency on this  - especially given how many young people are looking at social media and taking what they see and read as gospel.""

An  unidentified programmer  has produced a tool that exploits shortfalls in the way the malware encrypts a file that allows Windows to start up. In notes put on code-sharing site Github, he said he had produced the key generator to help his father-in-law unlock his Petya-encrypted computer. The malware, which started circulating in large numbers in March, demands a ransom of 0.9 bitcoins (Â£265).  It hid itself in documents attached to emails purporting to come from people looking for work.  Scrambling schemes Security researcher Lawrence Abrams, from the Bleeping Computer news site, said the key generator could unlock a Petya-encrypted computer  in seven seconds .  But the key generator requires victims to extract some information from specific memory locations on the infected drive.  And Mr Abrams said: ""Unfortunately, for many victims extracting this data is not an easy task.""  This would probably involve removing the drive and then connecting it up to another virus-free computer running Windows, he said. Another tool can then extract the data, which can be used on the  website set up to help people  unlock their computer.

First - messaging app Telegram says it has blocked 78 accounts that were being used by the so-called Islamic State group to communicate propaganda. It was ""shocked"" to learn the service was being used in this way. Worth stressing, again, that the  BBC reported this fact weeks ago . My colleagues at BBC Monitoring told me that since the account closures, several new pro-IS channels have been set up on Telegram, rapidly amassing followers.

The draft legislation seeks to protect sensitive personal data from hacking and government surveillance. EU citizens are entitled to personal privacy and this extends to online communications, the proposal argues. A ban on ""backdoors"" into encrypted messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram is also being considered. Encryption involves digitally scrambling a communication to protect its contents, and then using a digital key to reassemble the data. End-to-end encryption means the company providing the service does not have access to the key, meaning it cannot ""listen in"" to what is being shared - giving the sender and recipient added confidence in the privacy of their conversation. ""The principle of confidentiality should apply to current and future means of communication, including calls, internet access, instant messaging applications, email, internet phone calls and personal messaging provided through social media,""  said a draft proposal  drawn up for the European Parliament's Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice, and Home Affairs. WhatsApp's privacy protections questioned after terror attack Jeremy Corbyn and Theresa May clash over security The proposal seeks to amend Article Seven of the EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights to add online privacy. It will require approval by committee's members, the wider European Parliament and the Council of Ministers before it can be passed into law. 'Existing techniques' During the UK's recent election campaign, the Conservative Party said that  tech firms should provide the authorities  ""access to information as required"" to help combat online radicalisation, but ministers have also said they do not want to weaken encryption. That has led to some confusion among tech industry leaders as to whether the government wants some kind of ""backdoor"", a way to have end-to-end encryption disabled in specific cases, or some other action. However, cyber-security experts warn that criminals can still find a way to protect their communications, even if end-to-end encryption is banned. media caption What is encryption? ""There are lots of existing techniques law enforcement can use,"" Dr Steven Murdoch, a cyber-security researcher in the department of computer science at University College London told the BBC.  ""One of them is traffic analysis, which is looking at patterns of communications, eg who is talking to who, when and from what location. ""The other one is hacking - equipment interference in British law - which can happen before data is encrypted and after it's been decrypted, so there are still ways for law enforcement to gain access to information.""  In the Manchester, Westminster and London Bridge terror attacks, the perpetrators were already known to UK security services, Dr Murdoch added. ""They were not stopped because there were either insufficient resources or the resources were not sufficiently prioritised,"" he said. ""The suggestions being considered by the UK government would be worse for computer security. So much of people's lives are now carried out online.

The tactic has emerged after Scotland Yard's cybercrime unit smashed a fake credit card fraud racket.  Officers realised crucial evidence in the investigation was concealed on a suspect's iPhone - but it would be unobtainable if the device was locked.  So a covert team seized it in the street while the suspect was on a call - beating the security settings.  The street seizure of the phone was dreamt up by detectives from  Operation Falcon , the specialist Metropolitan Police team running investigations into major fraud and related crimes organised online.  image copyright Metropolitan Police image caption Gabriel Yew: Phone seized in the street Gabriel Yew had been under investigation for the suspected manufacture of fake cards that gangs were using across Europe to buy luxury goods. Detectives suspected that he was using an iPhone exclusively to communicate to other members of the network but knew if they arrested him, he could refuse to unlock it and they would never see incriminating evidence. They considered whether they could legally force a suspect's finger or thumb on to the device's fingerprint reader to unlock it, but found they had no such power.  However, they concluded they could stage their own lawful ""street robbery"" - using a similar snatch technique to a thief - and in June a team set out to do precisely that.  Undercover surveillance officers trailed Yew and waited for him to unlock his phone to make a call - thereby disabling the encryption.  One officer then rushed in to seize the phone from Yew's hand - just as would happen in a criminal mugging. As his colleagues restrained the suspect, the officer continually ""swiped"" through the phone's screens to prevent it from locking before they had downloaded its data.

Experts say the trend towards ransoming sensitive private information could affect companies not just operationally but through reputation damage. It comes as hackers bragged after discovering an IT Director's secret porn collection. The targeted US firm has not publicly acknowledged that it was hacked. In its darknet blog post about the hack last month, the cyber-criminal gang named the IT director whose work computer allegedly contained the files. It also posted a screen grab of the computer's file library which included more than a dozen folders catalogued under the names of porn stars and porn websites. The infamous hacker group wrote: ""Thanks God for [named IT Director]. While he was [masturbating] we downloaded several hundred gigabytes of private information about his company's customers. God bless his hairy palms, Amen!"" The blog post has been deleted in the last couple of weeks, which experts say usually implies that the extortion attempt worked and the hackers have been paid to restore data, and not publish any more details. The company did not respond to requests for comment. The same hacker group is also currently trying to pressure another US utility company into paying a ransom, by posting an employee's username and password for a members-only porn website. 'The new norm' Another ransomware group which also has a darknet website shows the use of similar tactics. The relatively new gang has published private emails and pictures, and is calling directly for the mayor of a hacked municipality in the US to negotiate its ransom. In another case, hackers claim to have found an email trail showing evidence of insurance fraud at a Canadian agriculture company. Brett Callow, a threat analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft, says the trend points to an evolution of ransomware hacking. ""This is the new norm. Hackers are now actually searching the data for information that can be weaponised. If they find anything that is incriminating or embarrassing, they'll use it to leverage a larger pay-out. These incidents are no longer simply cyber-attacks about data, they are full-out extortion attempts."" Another example of this was seen in December 2020, when the cosmetic surgery chain The Hospital Group was  held to ransom  with the threat of publication of 'before and after' images of patients. Ransomware is evolving Ransomware has evolved considerably since it first appeared decades ago. Criminals used to operate alone, or in small teams, targeting individual internet users at random by booby-trapping websites and emails. In the last few years, they've become more sophisticated, organised and ambitious. media caption Technology explained: what is ransomware? Criminal gangs are estimated to be making tens of millions of dollars a year, by spending time and resources targeting and attacking large companies or public bodies for huge pay-outs, sometimes totalling millions of dollars. Brett Callow has been following ransomware tactics for years, and says he saw another shift in methods in late 2019. ""It used to be the case that the data was just encrypted to disrupt a company, but then we started seeing it downloaded by the hackers themselves. ""It meant they could charge victims even more because the threat of selling the data on to others was strong."" Tough to defend against  This latest trend of threatening to publicly damage an organisation or individual has particularly concerned experts because it is hard to defend against. Keeping good backups of company data helps businesses to recover from crippling ransomware attacks, but that is not enough when the hackers use extortionware tactics. media caption Watch: The factory brought to its knees by ransomware hackers Cyber-security consultant Lisa Ventura said: ""Employees should not be storing anything that could harm a firm reputationally on company servers. Training around this should be provided by organisations to all their staff. ""It's a troubling shift in angle for the hackers because ransomware attacks are not only getting more frequent, they are also getting more sophisticated. ""By identifying factors such as reputational damage, it offers far more leverage to extort money from victims."" A lack of victim reporting and a culture of cover-up makes estimating the overall financial cost of ransomware difficult. Experts at Emsisoft estimate that ransomware incidents in 2020 cost as much as $170bn (Â£123bn) in ransom payments, downtime and disruption.

With end-to-end encryption, messages are scrambled as they leave the sender's device and can only be decrypted by the recipient's device. It renders messages unreadable if they are intercepted, for example by criminals or law enforcement. Whatsapp, which has a billion users worldwide, said file transfers and voice calls would be encrypted too. The Facebook-owned company said protecting private communication was one of its ""core beliefs"". media caption What is encryption? Encryption was thrown under the spotlight after the FBI asked Apple to help it access data on an iPhone used by California gunman Syed Farook. Whatsapp said: ""The idea is simple: when you send a message, the only person who can read it is the person or group chat that you send that message to. No one can see inside that message. Not cybercriminals. Not hackers. Not oppressive regimes. Not even us."" Users with the latest version of the app were notified about the change when sending messages on Tuesday. The setting is enabled by default. Amnesty International called the move a ""huge victory"" for free speech. ""Whatsapp's roll out of the Signal Protocol, providing end to end encryption for its one billion users worldwide, is a major boost for people's ability to express themselves and communicate without fear,"" the organisation said in a statement. ""This is a huge victory for privacy and free speech, especially for activists and journalists who depend on strong and trustworthy communications to carry out their work without putting their lives at greater risk."" Whatsapp's decision was also welcomed by security professionals. ""Wire-tappers lament, law-abiding citizens rejoice, for WhatsApp's latest update is a victory for communications privacy,"" said Lee Munson, a security researcher for Comparitech.  ""With the ability to access data removed even from the company behind the app, only ill-informed law enforcement agencies are likely to mutter 'terrorists' as the masses enjoy the encrypted text messages, photos, video and phone calls they've been demanding ever since Edward Snowden blew the lid on government surveillance."" The move is likely to irk law enforcement agencies, particularly the US Department of Justice which has recently expressed concern over ""unreachable"" information contained in devices. The DoJ did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Tuesday. Indeed, FBI attorney James Baker has reportedly criticised the move saying encryption threatens the work of law enforcement. ""It has public safety costs. Folks have to understand that, and figure out how they are going to deal with that,"" he said, according to  the US News and World Report news site . ""Do they want the public to bear those costs? Do they want the victims of terrorism to bear those costs?"" Mr Baker was speaking at the International Association of Privacy Professionals summit.

A statement about encryption was released  by the Information Technology Industry Council (ITIC) - a  policy body that represents tech giants. Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Samsung and many other computer industry firms are all ITIC members. It said encryption helped preserve safety and security every day. The ITIC is a global lobby and policy group that communicates the views of tech firms to politicians and legislative bodies. The statement comes after many politicians criticised the data-scrambling systems that tech firms are increasingly applying to hardware and services.  They have called for encryption to be weakened in order to help police and intelligence services catch criminals or thwart potential terror attacks. Others want backdoors included in encryption software that would give law enforcement access to data that is otherwise locked away. But, said the ITIC, weakening encryption in a bid to help the ""good guys"" was a mistake. Doing so ""would actually create vulnerabilities to be exploited by the bad guys"", it warned.

The method is often used by private companies that want to use the expertise of ""friendly"" hackers to find holes in their systems. It came after the US defence secretary backed strong encryption amid the FBI's phone unlocking row with Apple. Ash Carter called on tech firms and the US government to work together. The US Department of Defense launched its Hack the Pentagon project on Wednesday, inviting vetted outside hackers to test the security of some of its public websites. According to the Reuters news agency, the programme will be modelled on the hacking bounties often run by firms, in which experts are offered incentives to identify and report security issues. The Pentagon said it was also considering offering financial rewards. 'Digital defences' ""I am confident that this innovative initiative will strengthen our digital defences and ultimately enhance our national security,"" Mr Carter said. The Pentagon has long tested its own networks using internal so-called ""red teams"" but this initiative - the first such scheme to be run by the US federal government - would open at least some of its vast network of computer systems to cyberchallenges from across industry and academia. However, the Pentagon said that other more sensitive networks or key weapons programs would not be included in the scheme, at least initially. ""The goal is not to comprise any aspect of our critical systems, but to still challenge our cybersecurity in a new and innovative way,"" one senior defence official told Reuters. The official said they expected thousands of qualified participants to sign up ahead of the pilot scheme's opening in April. image copyright Getty Images image caption FBI director James Comey appeared before Congress amid his bureau's encryption battle with Apple During a visit to Silicon Valley on Tuesday, Mr Carter underscored the US military's support for data security and strong encryption. Speaking on the day that both  Apple and the FBI appeared before the US congress  over the former's refusal to help the latter overcome an iPhone's encryption protection, he said that the Pentagon viewed strong encryption as critical. Reuters reported that Mr Carter declined to address a live case directly and said that no one case should drive policy decisions. But he did call for greater co-operation between Silicon Valley and Washington on data security. He said that a failure to work together would allow China, Russia and others who he said did not favour a free internet to set new global standards, according to the news agency. ""We shouldn't let the solutions to this larger issue of how to handle data security as a society be driven by any one particular case,"" Mr Carter told reporters after a speech to the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco. ""It would be unreasonable."" In his speech, Mr Carter said: ""It is easy to see wrong ways to do this. One would be a law hastily written in anger or grief. Another would be to have the rules be written by Russia or China."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Encryption has become a battleground between tech firms and governments On the same day, it was announced that the Turing Award had been given to a pair of cryptographers whose ideas helped make the internet possible. According to the Associated Press, the recipients - Whitfield Diffie, a former chief security officer of Sun Microsystems, and Martin Hellman, a professor emeritus of electrical engineering at Stanford University - said that giving governments control over encrypted communications would put everyone at risk. The pair were chosen for the $1m (Â£700,000) award for contributions to computing for the ideas of public-key cryptography and digital signatures, which they introduced in 1976. The concepts now secure all kinds of data, from online communications and financial transactions to internet-connected infrastructure like power plants, the AP agency reported.

Published 2 March 2016 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright iStock The clash between  Apple and the FBI over whether the company should provide access to encrypted data on a locked iPhone  used by one of the San Bernardino attackers highlights debates about privacy and data security which have raged for decades.  Cryptography was once controlled by the state and deployed only for military and diplomatic ends. But in the 1970s, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised a system which took encryption keys away from the state and marked the start of the so-called ""Crypto Wars"".  Whitfield Diffie and three other experts spoke to the  BBC World Service Inquiry programme  about the tensions at the heart of the spat between Apple and the FBI.  Whitfield Diffie: The revolution begins In 1975, cryptographer Whitfield Diffie devised ""public key cryptography"", which revolutionised encryption.  ""The basic techniques we used until public key cryptography come from around 1500 in the western world, and were known from about 800 in the Middle East.  ""They are basically arithmetic. Not ordinary integer arithmetic, but something like clock arithmetic - it's 11 o'clock and you wait three hours and you get 2 o'clock - and table lookups. What's the 5th element in the table? What's the 20th element?  ""The trouble is you can't do them very well without some kind of mechanical computation. A human being can't do enough of those calculations to produce a secure system without making too many mistakes.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Whitfield Diffie's discovery marked a paradigmatic shift in cryptography ""Before what we did, you could not have supported cryptography outside a fairly integrated organisation. If you look at the US Department of Defense, it's very large, but very centralised; everybody knows the chain of command. ""They can have a trusted entity run by the National Security Agency (NSA) to manage the keys [used by the military and government]. If you were in the military, and it was part of your assignment to talk to somebody securely in another part of the military, they would supply you with a key, and every morning you come out and put one in your teletype machine or phone or whatever.   ""But the internet is not just meant for friends to talk to friends, it's for everybody to talk to everybody. Until you have public key cryptography you have no way of arranging the keys on demand at a moment's notice for these secure communications.   ""That's what browsers do with websites all the time. Amazon, eBay, all of the merchants on the internet encrypt at least some of the traffic you have with them, at the very least the payment portion of it. ""[At the time] the NSA reacted like any other enterprise that has had a monopoly in a market for a long period of time. Suddenly somebody was treading on its turf, and it made several attempts to recapture its market."" Susan Landau: Crypto Wars  Susan Landau is professor of Cyber Security Policy at Worcester Polytechnic Institute.  ""Public-key cryptography was mathematically elegant and also quite elementary. That's what made it so powerful and so wonderful. ""The NSA said 'Wait a minute: this work should be classified.' They had been accustomed to being the only place that cryptography was done. They didn't want a competitor developing algorithms that maybe they would have trouble breaking into. They wanted to hold the keys to the kingdom.  image copyright Getty Images image caption The NSA tried unsuccessfully to restrict access to Whitfield Diffie's discovery ""There was a big fight between the academic and industry research community and the NSA. But it was settled fairly amicably, fairly quickly. The next problem was who would control the development of cryptography standards for the US government.   ""The NSA does this for military and diplomatic communications, but there's a vast need for cryptography for civilian agencies such as health and human services, education, agriculture. The National Bureau of Standards had been doing this in the 1970s but in the 1980s the NSA began pushing in this direction.   ""Congress, who had always looked more favourably on the civilian side, put the National Institute of Standards and Technology in charge. ""But the law also included this little thing about three people from NSA approving certain things. They exercised tremendous control, and kept blocking standards that were more friendly to the commercial sector. That battle went on between 1987 until the mid 1990s. It was quite ugly. ""Another battle was over the clipper chip. Clipper was a very hard algorithm with a secure key, but the key was split and was to be shared with agencies of the federal government. The idea was [that] a business person travelling overseas would be able to use a clipper-enabled phone and talk securely with the office back at home.  ""But if you're doing something illegal the US government will be able to decrypt easily, because the keys are held by its agencies. ""It was a complete flop. Outside the US, no one wanted it. Inside the US, no one bought it. It was a total failure. ""The controls on cryptography in the 1990s were very odd because they were controls on an export. If you wanted to export a computer or communications device with cryptography, you needed an export licence from the US government.   ""Much of the time you would get 'We're looking at it, we'll get back to you.' Of course, when you're selling high tech, you don't need a delay of two months, [so] you decide not to have strong encryption within the device - you put in something very weak that the US government will allow to go without a licence. The effect was to not have strong encryption domestically as well as abroad.  ""In 2000, the US government loosened the controls on export of devices with strong encryption; it looked as if the private sector won the battle.""  Alan Woodward: Going dark Alan Woodward is an expert in signals intelligence, intelligence gathered from communications, who has worked for the UK government in various roles.  ""Suppose you got intelligence that people appeared to be mobilising their military forces. You'd need to know whether that was a prelude to war, or just an exercise. One of the ways to do that was by analysing the signals and communications traffic going around on the other side. ""In the early 2000s, it got harder. Previously they'd had the ability to decrypt things that were weakly encrypted. You could throw a super computer at the problem and try all the possible keys until you unlock the message.  ""You just physically couldn't do that for the number of encrypted messages that were starting to pile up. But also, the forms of encryption were becoming stronger. The encryption that was being used by governments themselves back in the 1970s was called the Data Encryption Standard. With a modern PC, you can break that in a matter of seconds. That kind of evolution in encryption and decryption has been going on ever since.  image copyright Thinkstock image caption People use the Tor network to browse the internet and communicate in private ""It got worse because there were various other forms of technology that were based on encryption, where you were able to remain anonymous, completely hidden. There's a thing called  the Tor network  which causes security agencies a great deal of trouble, because you don't even know where that person is based, never mind who they're communicating with.  ""Governments recognised that there wasn't a lot you could do about this technically or from a policy perspective. It's out there. So what you have to do is  be able to get at it before it is encrypted or after it's decrypted.   ""They recognised that they needed to work more closely with the technology providers because they were the ones that owned the infrastructure that was being used.  They were the ones running it; it was no longer governments and state telecommunications companies.  ""They had very good relationships. Microsoft produced a suite of software called Cofee (Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor), which is only given to government and Law Enforcement Agencies. It's a forensic tool that allows you to analyse Windows systems.  ""You used to be able to go along to Apple and they could unlock the phone. With messaging services it was possible for governments with the right authorisation to go along and sit in the middle of the conversation and look at the messages in a non-encrypted form.   ""All of that changed when Edward Snowden got his leaks out.""  Jeff Larson: The Snowden Effect Jeff Larson is a reporter at New York investigative newsroom ProPublica. It worked with the Guardian newspaper on the sensitive material leaked by Edward Snowden from the US National Security Agency in 2013.  ""I had seen something in the Snowden tranche of documents that made me suspicious that the NSA and GCHQ had been working behind the scenes to crack encryption that powers internet technologies. ""When you log into your bank or Twitter or Facebook, your web browser talks to those servers over what's known as TLS, which is an encryption layer that protects the confidentiality of that traffic.   ""The intelligence agencies - not only NSA and GCHQ, but Canada and Australia and New Zealand- had spent 10 years and untold billions of dollars trying to break these fundamental encryption technologies.   ""They honed things, like their power with super computers, but they were also able to mount a programme of inserting back doors into cryptographic software, and - perhaps a bit more troubling - the NSA launched a covert campaign to influence the very standards that programmers rely on to create encryption.   ""So standards bodies write up 'here's how encryption works, here's how you implement it in your software', and the NSA was actually working against that effort. image copyright Getty Images image caption Edward Snowden's revelations angered many in the technology sector ""Ever since [the Snowden revelations were published in] 2013, there's been quite a movement to further encrypt the internet.   ""I think there's been an awakening on the part of private companies that it is important to their users to keep [their data] confidential and secret.  ""Apple saw these revelations about the overreach of intelligence services and law enforcement services, and created a phone that was harder to crack because they wanted to increase the security of their users. I do believe that. ""The Apple case is very hard. I see the arguments on both sides. I see the fact that the FBI wants access to this information, and I also see Apple's need to protect its customers' privacy.   ""I hope that we come to a conclusion that is more open and transparent.

In relation to the issue of frustrating the investigation, the defence solicitor said that the court could put reporting requirements on the defendant, that they could tag him, place him under a curfew and freeze his assets. However, Deputy District Judge Phillip Mateer refused bail, stating: ""I'm not satisfied the conditions would give the court confidence that he wouldn't abscond.

The Netherlands began reviewing its policies after the recent Paris terrorist attacks. But this week it said ""restrictive"" measures would put citizens at risk. Encryption is a way of protecting communications or data so that it is incomprehensible without the correct passcode or key. Advocates say it protects users by preventing criminals and spies from prying into private conversations.  But security agencies have said  they struggled  to bypass encrypted messaging platforms used by groups such as so-called Islamic State to plan attacks. ""We are not some kind of maniacs who are ideologues against encryption,"" FBI director James Comey said in November:     ""But we have a problem that encryption is crashing into public safety and we have to figure out, as people who care about both, how to resolve it.""  Going Dutch In a  letter published this week , the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice concluded there were arguments for and against ""strong encryption"". However, it said allowing law enforcers to access protected data would make digital systems vulnerable to ""criminals, terrorists and foreign intelligence services"". ""This would have undesirable consequences for the security of information stored and communicated and the integrity of ICT systems, which are increasingly of importance for the functioning of the society,"" it added. image copyright Getty Images image caption President Obama has argued tech firms should share encrypted data with security agencies Despite objections from the FBI, the White House has dropped plans to force tech firms to share encrypted data. But the UK government hopes to secure such powers through its Draft Investigatory Powers Bill - referred to by some as the Snooper's Charter. The bill also includes a stipulation that internet and phone companies keep records of every website, app and service to which a computer connects. 'Weaken security' The proposals have met with fierce resistance from privacy advocates and  tech firms .  Some fear it will legitimise the mass surveillance programmes of the US and UK security agencies uncovered by  whistleblower Edward Snowden  in 2013.   In December, Apple told a parliamentary select committee scrutinising the bill that ""in this rapidly evolving cyber-threat environment, companies should remain free to implement strong encryption to protect customers"". And this week, William Binney, ex-technical director of the US National Security Agency, said the bill would be ""totalitarian"" and ""cost lives"". ""It is 99% useless,"" he said in a letter sent to MPs.  ""Who wants to know everyone who has ever looked at Google or the BBC?

The firm had faced criticism after it emerged that the feature had been dropped in a recent update to Fire OS. Amazon had  justified the move by saying that  ""customers weren't using"" the privacy facility. It now intends to reintroduce it before the end of May. Disk encryption has become a topical issue as it lies at the heart of a clash between Apple and the FBI. The facility digitally scrambles data on a device, making it impossible to make sense of it unless a passcode or other ID check is provided.  The dispute involving Apple concerns the tech firm's refusal to alter its own mobile operating system to prevent an iPhone's data being wiped if too many incorrect passcode guesses are typed in.  Amazon has publicly backed Apple's stance  via a legal filing known as an amicus brief , which was submitted to a US court last week. media caption What is encryption? Angry owners Amazon removed disk encryption when it released Fire OS 5 last year. It included the operating system with its Fire tablets, as well as its TV-streaming devices. However, a backlash only occurred after Amazon started making the update available to owners of its older Fire tablets, who noticed the security facility was no longer available. ""I will no longer be able to keep my business email... as our institution requires that encryption be used,""  wrote one tablet owner on the firm's forums . ""I cannot believe Amazon just 'deleted' this critical feature."" Another posted: ""In an era where devices store information on everything from browsing habits to bank information it's nearly unthinkable for a company to deliberately remove the one feature that can protect a customer from identity theft if their device is lost or stolen."" The firm reversed its stance over the weekend. ""We will return the option for full disk encryption with a Fire OS update coming this spring,"" a spokesman told the BBC. The flip-flop has not affected the firm's continued use of encryption to protect data sent between its devices and its data centres. Encrypted by default Fire OS is a variant of Android.  Google offers full device encryption in its version of the operating system, and in October told device manufacturers that it should be  switched on by default  in new handsets powerful enough to support it. image copyright Google image caption Google made disk encryption the default option in Android Marshmallow One expert suggested Amazon should take a similar step. ""There's growing recognition that better security is needed in the whole sphere of computing and particularly mobile devices,"" commented Dr Steven Murdoch from University College London. ""So, I was surprised when Amazon removed the feature.  ""It's certainly possible that many people didn't enable it - perhaps they found it inconvenient to do so.

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-30794953|"Can the government ban encryption? By Jane Wakefield Technology reporter Published 13 January 2015 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Reuters image caption Britain's prime minister wants new laws in the wake of the Paris attacks Whenever the terrorist threat is increased, as it has been since the tragic events in Paris last week, so too are the calls from politicians to increase the powers of the people they employ to protect the public from such threats. Those agencies can only do their job, the argument goes, if they have full access to the online chatter of those planning terrorist atrocities. As the UK's Prime Minister David Cameron put it in a speech this week - there should be no ""means of communication"" which ""we cannot read"". But in an era when communication takes many forms, and with the added problem that much of this communication is encrypted, how easy is it to turn this sound bite into reality? Legislation image copyright PA image caption There are myriad ways to communicate online and many of them are encrypted For Mr Cameron the answer lies in a new ""comprehensive piece of legislation"" that will close the ""safe spaces"" used by suspected terrorists. So what are those safe spaces?  Although Mr Cameron doesn't name any, it is likely he is referring to new apps such as WhatsApp and Snapchat which allow people to chat with relative anonymity by keeping their services encrypted. But the battle is much more wide-ranging as established names such as Google and Apple promise to do more to ensure that encryption is used as default on their services. After the revelations from whistle-blower Edward Snowden about mass surveillance programs, firms are determined to be seen to be putting the control of their data back in the hands of consumers. In the past, governments with the appropriate warrants could go to firms such as Apple and ask them to unlock the communications on phones. image copyright Reuters image caption The iPhone 6 is encrypted by default and Apple cannot open it for anyone No more. Apple has changed its infrastructure to make it impossible for it to hand over any data from the iPhone 6's iMessage service, for example. Such military-grade lock-down of devices inevitably terrifies governments so it should come as no surprise that they are fighting back with new legislation. Although, it should be noted, that the new legislation Mr Cameron referred to in his speech is probably just a resurrection of an old law.  The Draft Communication Bill of 2012, dubbed the ""snoopers' charter"" by critics, aimed to extend the range of data that communication companies had to store for 12 months. It would have included, for the first time, details of messages sent on social media, webmail, voice calls over the internet and gaming. Officials would not have been able to see the content without a warrant but the bill was blocked by the Liberal Democrats. Politics continues to dog attempts to revive it with Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg saying after Mr Cameron's latest speech that his party will continue to oppose any such legislation. Crypto-wars image copyright Thinkstock image caption Should governments have a master key to unlock communications? At the heart of the debate is the question about how the government deals with the fact that communication data is increasingly being encrypted. As Prof Alan Woodward, a security expert from the University of Surrey, puts it: ""You can have all the legislation in the world but you still might not be able to read what you've got."" Encryption has long terrified governments.  The so-called crypto-wars began in the 1970s when the US government attempted to classify encryption as munition.  The Clinton administration in the 1990s tried to get industry to adopt the so-called Clipper chip - an encryption chip for which the government had a backdoor. The US government also tried to introduce something called key escrow - a policy that all encryption systems should leave a a spare key with a trusted third party. When software developer Phil Zimmermann developed PGP, a free mass-market encryption product for emails and files, the US government attempted to prosecute him because someone had exported his software from the US without government permission. Cybercriminals image copyright Thinkstock image caption Backdoors could be exploited by criminals And, however outrageous this may sound now, those two options remain the only ones for the government as, two decades later, they grapple with exactly the same issues. So does the idea of a golden key, a backdoor for the security service, make any more sense now than it did in the 1990s? Certainly the threat from terrorism is greater and few would argue with the sentiment that, if you are in danger and a police officer turns up at your backdoor - you are going to let them in. But the analogy implies that someone has control over who uses the backdoor and, of course, in the software sense this is impossible.  A backdoor in software is not just something for the security service. Anyone - including the criminals - may discover it and exploit it. ""A UK cryptographic backdoor would become the number one global target for cybercriminals. The UK government would not be able to keep it secure for long, particularly if it needed to give access to police and security services,"" said Matthew Bloch, managing director of internet hosting firm Bytemark. All of this has been debated before, of course.  Ahead of the controversial Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which came into force in 2000, both options of a backdoor and the idea of a key stored by a third party were considered and rejected by lawmakers. They opted instead for a third way - that someone in possession of an encryption key should be forced to hand it over to the authorities. That too is fraught with complexities. Often the person simply doesn't know the key. ""It comes down to passwords on laptops and you can't force someone to hand these over,"" said Prof Woodward. And encryption technology is evolving. ""Now there is a way of protecting secret information into the future so if a key is compromised the key agreed for a particular session changes,"" he explained. ""There are even technologies emerging that can give a false key which makes the system aware that the key was given under duress and wipes the data."" Mathematics not technology The technology industry tends to have a knee-jerk reaction to attempts from government to interfere in its processes.  Don't mess in things that you don't understand, they warn. The technology genie is out of the bottle and cannot be put back. In this particular case, some have interpreted Mr Cameron's words as meaning that the government is seeking to ban, in effect, a technology that underpins the global economy. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) encryption protects financial details when people shop or bank online while so-called end-to-end encryption such as PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) help keep personal messages private. ""Encryption is mathematics, not technology. It can't be suppressed by law,"" Mr Bloch told the BBC. Whatever route the government elected in the UK in May decides to go, Prof Woodward hopes that it will listen carefully to the technology industry. ""The government will need to take a lot of wide-ranging advice as this has the potential to go spectacularly wrong."" It is also worth noting, he added, that the men involved in the Paris shootings were known to the authorities and had been under surveillance until it was deemed that the threat from them had lessened. ""The security forces need better resources not more powers.""

The new law would have forced Indians to store plain-text versions of their encrypted data for 90 days and make it available to security agencies. The policy sparked outrage on social media, as most messaging services like WhatsApp use some form of encryption. Online banking and purchases will also be exempt from the law.   Indians have until 16 October to weigh in on the proposed measures, and the government has said that the final policy will only be drafted after the feedback is taken into account. The encryption policy was proposed to enhance information security in India. But experts argue that if enforced in its current form, the policy could make personal information vulnerable to hacking.  Plain text files like a Word document or email are not encrypted and can be read by anyone. Related Topics India Internet Social media More on this story Can the government ban encryption?

Hidden areas of the internet and encrypted communications make it harder to monitor terror suspects, warns Europol's Rob Wainwright. Tech firms should consider the impact sophisticated encryption software has on law enforcement, he said. Mr Wainwright was talking to 5 Live Investigates. A spokesman for TechUK, the UK's technology trade association, said: ""With the right resources and cooperation between the security agencies and technology companies, alongside a clear legal framework for that cooperation, we can ensure both national security and economic security are upheld."" Mr Wainwright said that in most current investigations the use of encrypted communications was found to be central to the way terrorists operated.  ""It's become perhaps the biggest problem for the police and the security service authorities in dealing with the threats from terrorism,"" he explained. ""It's changed the very nature of counter-terrorist work from one that has been traditionally reliant on having good monitoring capability of communications to one that essentially doesn't provide that any more."" Mr Wainwright, whose organisation supports police forces in Europe, said terrorists were exploiting the ""dark net"", where users can go online anonymously, away from the gaze of police and security services. Secret messaging But he is also concerned at moves by companies such as Apple to allow customers to encrypt data on their smartphones. And the development of heavily encrypted instant messaging apps is another cause for concern, he said. image copyright PA image caption Edward Snowden revealed that the UK's GCHQ was also involved in widespread surveillance of communications This meant people could send text and voice messages which police found very difficult or impossible to access, he said. ""We are disappointed by the position taken by these tech firms and it only adds to our problems in getting to the communications of the most dangerous people that are abusing the internet.  ""[Tech firms] are doing it, I suppose, because of a commercial imperative driven by what they perceive to be consumer demand for greater privacy of their communications."" Surveillance Mr Wainwright acknowledged this was a result of the revelations by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, who exposed how security services were conducting widespread surveillance of emails and messages.  He said security agencies now had to work to rebuild trust between technology firms and the authorities.  The TechUK spokesman told the programme: ""From huge volumes of financial transactions to personal details held on devices, the security of digital communications fundamentally underpins the UK economy.  ""Encryption is an essential component of the modern world and ensures the UK retains its position as one of the world's leading economies.  ""Tech companies take their security responsibilities incredibly seriously, and in the ongoing course of counter-terrorism and other investigations engage with law enforcement and security agencies.""  The programme also found evidence that supporters of the Islamic State (IS) are using encrypted sites to radicalise or groom new recruits. image copyright AP image caption Europol director Rob Wainwright says IS is believed to have up to 50,000 different twitter accounts On one blogging website, a 17-year-old girl who wants to become a ""jihadi bride"" is told that if she needs to speak securely she should use an encrypted messaging app.  The family of 15-year-old Yusra Hussein from Bristol, who went to Syria last year, also believe she was groomed in this way. Twitter terrorism The extent of the challenge faced by security services is shown in the scale of social media use by IS. Mr Wainwright revealed that IS is believed to have up to 50,000 different Twitter accounts tweeting up to 100,000 messages a day. Europol is now setting up a European Internet Referral Unit to identify and remove sites being used by terrorist organisations. Mr Wainwright also says current laws are ""deficient"" and should be reviewed to ensure security agencies are able to monitor all areas of the online world. ""There is a significant capability gap that has to change if we're serious about ensuring the internet isn't abused and effectively enhancing the terrorist threat. ""We have to make sure we reach the right balance by ensuring the fundamental principles of privacy are upheld so there's a lot of work for legislators and tech firms to do.""

Robert Hannigan said the encoding of data was being misused by a small number of people.  He said the rational response was not to think encryption was bad, but to look for pragmatic ways of responding.  Mr Hannigan was speaking as the FBI  engages in a legal battle  with Apple over the firm's encryption systems. At an event at MIT in Boston, Mr Hannigan, director of the UK government's communications intelligence agency, said it should be up to politicians - not companies or spies - to set the parameters. On his first day in charge of GCHQ in November 2014, Mr Hannigan wrote an opinion piece for the Financial Times accusing US tech companies of becoming the ""command and control network of choice"" for terrorist groups.   A year and a half later in Boston, Mr Hannigan conceded the comments caused a bigger stir than he expected and said they were wrongly seen as an attack on the tech industry.  The tone of his latest intervention was conciliatory, focusing on the need for government agencies and companies to work together to find solutions.  media caption What is encryption? ""We need a new relationship between the tech sector, academia, civil society and government agencies. We should be bridging the divide, sharing ideas and building a constructive dialogue in a less highly-charged atmosphere,"" he told the audience. Vulnerability Apple has designed phones with strong encryption which made it impossible for the company to retrieve data for the state, including in  the case of one of those involved in the San Bernadino attacks .   The company and its supporters have stressed that creating any form of ""key"" for the government to unlock data would also create a vulnerability for hackers and others to exploit.    Mr Hannigan did not mention Apple directly but emphasised the way in which GCHQ supported strong encryption because of the agency's role in protecting British data from hackers and other states.  He also pointed to the agency's pioneering work such as that of Alan Turing in World War Two who worked not just on breaking codes but also on securing speech through encryption.  image copyright AFP image caption Apple's position on encryption is strongly supported by its customers and other tech firms Mr Hannigan said two previously secret papers from 1970 by James Ellis, a leading GCHQ cryptographer, were being declassified which showed the early work on developing what became the now widely used system of public key cryptography.  That kind of innovation was what Mr Hannigan said he wanted to see today in dealing with the modern challenges surrounding encryption.  ""The solution is not, of course, that encryption should be weakened, let alone banned. But neither is it true that nothing can be done without weakening encryption,"" he said, adding that it was wrong to see every attempt to tackle the misuse of encryption by criminals and terrorists as a ""backdoor"".   Mr Hannigan reiterated that the British government position - as set out in the new investigatory powers bill - would not outlaw the type of end-to-end encryption which is at the heart of the row between Apple and the FBI.   Drawing the boundaries Instead, he said, it will demand companies take reasonable and practical steps to provide data when demanded.  ""Within the parameters set by legislation, it should be possible for technical experts to sit down together and work out solutions to particular manifestations of the abuse of encryption.""  Such conversations were more common before  the Snowden revelations , officials say, but since then companies have withdrawn and referred requests to their lawyers.   The decision about where to draw the boundaries was not one for either the companies or the spies, Mr Hannigan said, but instead for lawmakers.  ""It is not for me, as an intelligence official and civil servant, or for a law enforcement officer to make these broad judgements, whether about the use of data in general or encryption in particular; nor is it for tech company colleagues nor even for independent academics.   ""Since the trade-offs are for society as a whole, it must surely be for elected representatives to decide the parameters of what is acceptable."" Antony Walker, deputy chief executive of techUK, an organisation which represents tech firms, said the solution lay in government, academia and industry working together.  ""These are hugely complex issues,"" he said. ""This speech makes it very clear that there are no easy answers. It is a realistic assessment of the trade-offs that need to be made to secure our digital world.  ""We must not jeopardise our long-term security.""

As well as increased military activity, and the controversial suggestions to close the door on refugees, the next battle in the ""surely something can be done"" arena will be aimed squarely, and angrily, at Silicon Valley. Tech companies were already under pressure to make it easier for governments to access ""private"" communication apps and services. Those calls have intensified greatly since the attacks in Paris. ""If you create a product that allows evil monsters to communicate in this way, to behead children, to strike innocents - whether it's at a game in a stadium, in a small restaurant in Paris, take down an airline - that is a big problem,"" Dianne Feinstein, who chairs the Senate Intelligence Committee, told MSNBC. ""We need hi-tech's help in securing an internet [where] even with a court order you can't get to what they're saying. ""That's a big problem."" Cracking comms The ""problem"" is to do with encryption. Without encryption, all of the things we do online would be insecure, be it emailing, or shopping, or banking. They all rely on the principle that if you encrypt data using complex mathematics it is nigh-on impossible to crack. If you're using communication apps such as WhatsApp, Apple's iMessage, WeChat and so on, your messages are encrypted by default. It means that even if those companies wanted to hand over your messages to law enforcement, they couldn't. image copyright Thinkstock image caption A locked phone is locked for everyone - including Apple and Google That's bad, some say. ""There are a lot of technological capabilities that are available right now that make it exceptionally difficult, both technically as well as legally, for intelligence and security services to have the insight they need to uncover it,"" said CIA director John Brennan at a security forum on Monday. ""And I do think this is a time for particularly Europe, as well as here in the United States, for us to take a look and see whether or not there have been some inadvertent or intentional gaps that have been created in the ability of intelligence and security services to protect the people that they are asked to serve."" An opinion column in the New York Times , authored by Manhattan's district attorney, and the City of London Police commissioner, said ""encryption blocks justice"".  In the piece, published back in August, they wrote about a murder near Chicago in which a father of six had been shot. At the scene, officers found two mobile phones. But they were passcode locked. Neither Google or Apple (the phones ran their software) could unlock the phones, and therefore the data was inaccessible. ""On behalf of crime victims the world over,"" the opinion piece read, ""we are asking whether this encryption is truly worth the cost."" After Paris It's an argument that can be made with more vigour than ever after the Paris attacks. With access to communications, the anti-encryption advocates say, we could perhaps stop these tragic events from occurring. That's a claim worth scrutinising. It's early days in the investigation, and no evidence has yet been offered to show that encrypted communications were used to organise the atrocity. But, given that much of the world's population - from gossiping teenagers to deal-making business people - are using encryption regularly, it's not a wild assumption to consider that the attackers were too. image copyright Thinkstock image caption The attacks in Paris will energise calls for more access to communications data But technology industry is, on the whole, against the suggestion that law enforcement should have ""backdoors"" into popular services - the term given to a hidden way of circumventing the app's security. A backdoor, in the infosec world, is the term given to a method in which a supposedly secure system can be accessed. It could be a quirk in some code, or a vulnerability in how a system communicates. Whatever the weakness, typically, once backdoors are made public, they are fixed. Hackers make serious money by discovering backdoors and selling them on - often to government security services. Many in law enforcement and government feel there should be a backdoor made just for those in authority to investigate and stop criminals and terrorists. But some of tech's most influential figures say that the notion of a secure, secret backdoor is dangerously misguided.  If any backdoor exists, hackers will find it eventually. It would mean data security for all of us, not just criminals, would evaporate. No key The Edward Snowden leaks about mass surveillance changed the landscape in this debate dramatically. Faced with user backlash over apparent cooperation with the US government, technology companies were desperate to show they could be trusted. image copyright Getty Images image caption ""We can't provide it."" - Apple's Tim Cook on turning over iMessages They quickly implemented changes that were essentially designed to put them in a position of being able to credibly say: ""Listen, even if we wanted to help, we couldn't."" ""If the government laid a subpoena to get iMessages, we can't provide it,"" said Apple boss Tim Cook, speaking last year to US public broadcaster PBS. ""It's encrypted and we don't have a key. And so it's sort of - the door is closed."" For a company that is reluctant to say much about anything, Apple is bullish on encryption. At a dinner event earlier this year, Mr Cook pressed home his view. He said calls for intentional backdoors for government as an attack on ""civil liberties"". ""If you put a key under the mat for the cops,"" he said. ""A burglar can find it too."" Momentum But Silicon Valley companies are preparing themselves for a backlash against this attitude. Post-Snowden, the Obama administration was compelled to rejig its rules over data gathering, acknowledging that some of the actions of its security services were unconstitutional. Great news for Silicon Valley and privacy advocates. Gone is the wholesale collection of some types of data. In its place, a more selective means of data mining, but, crucially, a backing off of trying to get Apple et al to back down on their views over encryption. But after Paris, we could see a shift in momentum. A memo uncovered by the Washington Post, sent three months ago by Robert Litt, a lawyer working for the US National Intelligence office, said that while attitudes towards creating government backdoors were ""hostile"", that atmosphere ""could turn in the event of a terrorist attack or criminal event where strong encryption can be shown to have hindered law enforcement"".  Paris may just be that event. Offshore haven But if it is, how effective would those suggested measures be?  One of the apps being used extensively by so-called Islamic State is Telegram, a secure messaging app founded by Russian brothers Pavel and Nikolai Durov. image copyright Telegram image caption Telegram is being used by IS to broadcast messages The app allows broadcast channels, and my colleagues at BBC Monitoring logged that at least 4,500 people were listening to IS's channel on Telegram. Any US decision to force back doors into software wouldn't affect what Telegram does. The company is based in Berlin. Any attempt by European authorities would probably fall on deaf ears - the Durovs are no strangers to evading what they see as government meddling. Pavel Durov founded VKontakte (known now as VK), a social network with the lion's share of audience in Russia. It's not unfair to call it a Facebook clone - it looks almost identical. When Russian authorities wanted more access to the discussions on VK, Pavel fled. Telegram has repeatedly ignored the BBC's request for comment on this, and other, stories. But on Instagram, Pavel  made his feelings on the Paris attacks clear . ""I think the French government is as responsible as IS... for this, because it is their policies and carelessness which eventually led to the tragedy,"" he said. ""They take money away from hardworking people of France with outrageously high taxes and spend them on waging useless wars in the Middle East and on creating parasitic social paradise for North African immigrants. ""It is a disgrace to see Paris in the hands of short-sighted socialists who ruin this beautiful place."" In a comment posted to his profile on VKontakte, Pavel,  as quoted by the Moscow Times , mocked the suggestion his app should be blocked.  ""I propose banning words,"" he said. ""There's evidence [to suggest] that they're being used by terrorists to communicate."" Weak The attitude displayed by Pavel Durov exposes, pro-encryption advocates say, the inherent flaw in the argument for allowing government access. If Apple, Google, Facebook and others were compelled by law to introduce backdoors, terrorists would probably just move, as they have done already, to other platforms with a more anarchistic approach. It would leave services ""normal"" people use far less secure, while dangerous people would be operating on systems that are even harder to gain access to, with proprietors who are proudly anti-government. In the coming days, statements from politicians and law enforcement will be made, directed at the technology companies that handle our day-to-day communications. They'll be forced to look cooperative while not undermining the promises they made after the Snowden revelations. Put up against military or diplomatic action, taking affirmative steps against communication apps may seem an easy win in the war against terrorism.

If you're anything like me, it's a lot.  But imagine installing just one app that does almost everything - from buying a pizza, hailing a taxi, chatting to your friends and even booking a massage. It does exist and it's known as a super-app.  There are two major players in the market and the most popular,  with over a billion users , is WeChat. Created in 2011 by Chinese tech giant Tencent, WeChat started life as a messaging platform. It is now estimated to offer more than one million services through mini programmes, which are apps created by third-party companies and accessible through WeChat. More than an app: Trump's WeChat ban shocks Chinese abroad What is Tencent? That means you never have to leave WeChat's virtual universe (except perhaps to go to the bathroom).  Most of these services are only available to users in China, which is why you may not have heard of it despite its dominance. The other main player is Ant Group's Alipay, which  also has more than one billion users  and offers 120,000 mini programmes.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Angeline Liu sells on WeChat and says it's a part of ""daily life"" Business booms on WeChat Singapore-based Chinese entrepreneurs Angeline Liu and Angee Teng saw a unique opportunity to tap into WeChat's captive audience.  ""WeChat is a part of our daily life that we [can't] live without,"" says Ms Liu, who spends two to three hours a day on the app. ""Basically everything you need is within this one app and every part of your life is touched [by it]."" Three years ago they launched a business selling premium meat to Chinese customers in Singapore. ""You can browse the products, make purchases, make payments and complete the whole cycle within this app,"" Ms Liu says. They don't advertise through traditional channels or social media yet business is booming, with tens of thousands of dollars worth of orders rolling in every month. image copyright Getty Images image caption Angeline Liu sells premium meat via WeChat Why is China so good at creating super-apps? China leapfrogged into the internet era, which means people went from telephones to smartphones pretty quickly.  This allowed internet companies to innovate in a way their counterparts in the West haven't been able to. Rui Ma, who co-hosts the podcast Techbuzz, tells me it's also because data laws in China are quite different.  ""In the West we have a lot of rules and regulations, creating a lot of friction around these services that in China the government simply hasn't gotten around to regulating,"" she says. media caption How a little Ant became a financial giant That's not the only reason. ""Chinese internet companies think of building entire ecosystems, versus product-first or product-centric companies,"" she says. ""They're not just building a feature or one service. They're thinking about how to take the user's entire lifestyle and move it online."" A life lived online means a lot of transactions and a lot of data. Under Chinese law, all companies - not just WeChat - can be compelled to hand over that data to the ruling Communist Party. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute (ASPI) says it has found evidence of censorship on WeChat in China and warns this could also happen to overseas users.  image copyright Getty Images image caption Under Chinese law, all firms can be compelled to hand over data to the ruling Communist Party. ""The risks associated with WeChat's lack of end-to-end encryption is that Tencent and WeChat can have access to any of your data on WeChat,"" says Audrey Fritz, who co-authored an ASPI report looking at the Communist Party's influence on Chinese internet firms. ""[They are] bound by [China's] cyber-security laws to give any data on WeChat or any of their apps to the government, if the Communist Party should request that."" Tencent told the BBC it complies with the laws and regulations of each market it operates in, adding that user privacy and data security are core values.  ""User privacy and data security are core values at Tencent. We hold ourselves to the highest standards in protecting our users while ensuring we comply with all laws and regulations in the markets in which we operate,"" the company said.  Concern over privacy and data security could be among the reasons it has been difficult for these Chinese apps to expand overseas. Throw in the fact that the domestic market in China is so big, there's really no need to go anywhere else.   image copyright Getty Images image caption Indonesian-based Gojek has grown from a motorcycle-hailing platform to offering other services South East Asia a contender to produce the next super-app The race to build the world's next super-app is revving up and many of the frontrunners are based in South East Asia.

Perhaps surprisingly for a company that calls itself a super-app, Mr Aluwi says Gojek isn't trying to monopolise its users' time.

Anthony Kamara, 33, was tracked down by police who cracked secret messages the group sent in encrypted messages. The 'Manc Joe' gang operated from Liverpool and ran hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of heroin and crack cocaine to Exeter during the first seven months of 2020. Seven other gang members were sentenced at Exeter Crown Court last year. County lines is where  urban drug gangs expand their markets  for crack cocaine and heroin into smaller towns and cities. Kamara, of Ritson Street, Toxteth, Liverpool, admitted conspiracy to supply heroin and cocaine and was jailed for six years by Judge Peter Johnson. The judge told him: ""You played a highly significant and active part in bringing drugs down and taking money back and running the phones."" Peter Coombe, for the prosecution, said Kamara's role was only just below that of organiser Connor Wilbraham, 21, from Merseyside, who set up the drugs line while on the run from the police. Wilbraham was  jailed for seven and a half years  in December. In November, five other men aged between 21 and 46 were  jailed for between two-and-a-half and four years  each. Lewis Rees, now aged 18, of Woodchurch Estate, Birkenhead, was sentenced to two years, suspended for two years. Mr Rees was deemed to be a modern slave by the national referral mechanism and charges against a 16-year-old were dropped after he received a similar adjudication. The gang were caught because their street dealers became highly visible to police during the first lockdown and detectives were able to trace the leaders through the encrypted messages on their phones. They used the street names of 'Manc Joe' or 'Joey' in an apparent attempt to hide their Merseyside origins. Peter White, defending Kamara, said he was drawn into the conspiracy after he lost his job with Jaguar Land Rover.

Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein, high commissioner for human rights at the United Nations, has warned that a ""Pandora's box"" will be opened if Apple co-operates with the FBI. The FBI has ordered the tech giant to assist it with unlocking an iPhone used by San Bernadino gunman Syed Farook.  Prince Al Hussein said the law enforcement agency ""deserves everyone's full support"" in its investigation. However, encryption was essential in the interests of freedom, he added. ""There are many ways to investigate whether or not these killers had accomplices besides forcing Apple to create software to undermine the security features of their own phones,""  he said in a statement . ""It is potentially a gift to authoritarian regimes, as well as to criminal hackers. ""Encryption and anonymity are needed as enablers of both freedom of expression and opinion, and the right to privacy. Without encryption tools, lives may be endangered."" Syed Rizwan Farook and his wife Tashfeen Malik killed 14 people and left 22 injured when they opened fire at his place of work in California in December 2015. The FBI has asked Apple to disable a feature that means the data on an iPhone is erased after 10 incorrect attempts at the four-digit password. It also wants to be able to run software that could go through the 10,000 possible combinations to unlock the gunman's handset quickly. Apple says agreeing to the request would set  ""a dangerous precedent"" . Tech support A number of major tech firms have also pledged their support for Apple's refusal to circumvent its own security. Two groups of tech giants have now filed an amicus brief, which allows parties not directly involved in a court case, but who feel they are affected by it, to give their view. They include Twitter, AirBnB, eBay, LinkedIn, Reddit, Amazon, Microsoft, Snapchat and Yahoo. However, a lawyer representing a group of Farook's surviving victims said he would file similar legal paperwork on their behalf in support of the FBI. ""They were targeted by terrorists, and they need to know why, how this could happen,"" said Stephen Larson, a former judge.

Called ""Freak"", the bug was found in software used to encrypt data passing between web servers and web users.  Initially the flaw was thought only to affect some users of Android and Blackberry phones and Apple's Safari web browser. Microsoft's warning suggests millions more may be at risk of losing data. The Freak flaw was discovered by encryption and security expert Karthikeyan Bhargavan and lets attackers force data travelling between a vulnerable site and a visitor to use weak encryption. This makes it easier to crack open the data and steal sensitive information. Statistics gathered by a group  set up to monitor the impact of the Freak flaw suggest about 9.5% of the web's top one million websites are susceptible to such attacks. The monitoring group has also produced  an online tool  that lets people check if they are using a browser that is vulnerable to the flaw. Vulnerable Apple is expected to produce a patch for the flaw next week and Google has updated its version of Chrome for the Mac to remove its susceptibility to Freak. It has yet to say what action it is taking with Android. In a security advisory note released on 5 March, Microsoft said every current version of Windows that uses Internet Explorer, or any non-Microsoft software that calls on a part of Windows called Secure Channel, was vulnerable to the Freak flaw. Microsoft has issued advice about ways to remove the vulnerability from some of its software but said applying these fixes could cause ""serious problems"" with other programs. It said it was working on a separate security update to remove the vulnerability. In its advisory , Microsoft said it had not received any information that suggested the attack was being actively exploited by cybercriminals.

Alex Stamos pressed NSA director Adm Mike Rogers on whether the access to encrypted data requested by the US authorities should also be granted to the Russian and Chinese governments. Adm Rogers insisted an agreement could be reached ""within a framework"". The tense exchange came after many top tech figures refused to attend a White House cybersecurity summit this month. ""If we're going to build defects, backdoors or golden master keys for the US government, do you believe we should do so... for the Chinese government, the Russian government, the Saudi Arabian government, the Israeli government, the French government?"" asked Mr Stamos, Yahoo's chief information security officer. After initially dodging the question, Adm Rogers - who took over as director of the NSA last year - responded: ""I think that we're lying that this isn't technically feasible. ""Now, it needs to be done within a framework. I'm the first to acknowledge that."" image copyright Getty Images image caption Adm Mike Rogers testifying before a Senate committee while a vice-admiral According to a transcript  provided by the Just Security website , he argued that he did not want the FBI and NSA to unilaterally decide what access they should have, but insisted an agreement was achievable. Pressed on whether he thought that access should also be granted to other nations' governments, Adm Rogers said: ""I think we can work our way through this."" Mr Stamos responded: ""I'm sure the Chinese and Russians are going to have the same opinion."" The exchange took place before delegates at a cybersecurity conference hosted by the New America Foundation on Monday. image copyright Getty Images image caption The US authorities want to ensure they have access to encrypted data in order to investigate crime There has been an increasingly tense relationship between the US authorities and Silicon Valley since information was leaked by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. Encryption of user data has subsequently become increasingly popular and, in some cases, the companies hand over the keys to users, making it difficult to break. But the White House has asked tech firms to share more data with law enforcement agencies. And the US authorities want them to build in vulnerabilities that they would be able to exploit. The rift was illustrated when, earlier this month, senior Google, Yahoo and Facebook executives turned down invitations to a White House cybersecurity summit at Stanford University. Tim Cook, of Apple, was one of the few top tech bosses to appear. Adm Rogers told the conference on Monday that the NSA needed a way to access data if it was believed that a device was ""being used for criminal, or in my case, foreign intelligence or national security issues"". But he acknowledged that there were legitimate concerns to be addressed before a ""legal framework"" could be established.

Without anonymising tools, many people will find it far harder to express opinions without censure, it says. Any attempt to weaken encryption software will only curb this ability, it warns. The report comes as many governments seek to put ""backdoors"" in encryption software to aid law enforcement. ""Encryption and anonymity, separately or together, create a zone of privacy to protect opinion and belief,""  says the report written by David Kaye , a special rapporteur in the UN's office of the high commissioner for human rights. No backdoors The tools to bestow such protection are essential, it says, given the ""unprecedented capacity"" governments, companies, thieves and pranksters now have to interfere with people's ability to express themselves. Lacking such tools, it adds, many people will be unable to fully explore ""basic aspects of their identity"" such as their gender, religion, ethnicity, origins or sexuality. The software acts as a ""shield"" for opinions against external scrutiny - a fact that is ""particularly important in hostile political, social, religious and legal environments"", says the report. ""States should not restrict encryption and anonymity, which facilitate and often enable the rights to freedom of opinion and expression."" The report acknowledges the need for police forces and other agencies to get at encrypted messages and other communications - but says this should be done on a ""case-by-case"" basis and should not be applied to a ""mass of people"". It also cautions against the use of backdoors and weak encryption systems that can put anonymity in peril as much as they aid law enforcement. The report is being released against a background of calls from the US and UK governments to hobble encryption - so intelligence agencies and others have access to scrambled communications to help tackle crime and terrorism. Mr Kaye's report is due to be presented to the UN's Human Rights Council in June.

The proposal outlined in the Queen's Speech to ""modernise the law on communications data"" will divide opinion. But prepare for another long battle over the way that law is framed and the balance it strikes between privacy and public safety. The row over forcing internet service providers (ISPs) to hold on to far more data about their users' online activities has stretched over three parliaments. The idea first came up under the last Labour government, when it was quashed by Conservative and Liberal Democrat opposition. Then it was resurrected by the Coalition, with Theresa May's plans - immediately dubbed the Snooper's Charter - blocked by her Liberal Democrat partners. Now we have in the Queen's Speech what looks like a much wider proposal for a new Investigatory Powers Bill. The government says this will ""provide the police and intelligence agencies with the tools to keep you and your family safe"", will ""maintain the ability of our intelligence agencies to target the online communications of terrorists"", and will ""cover all investigatory powers including communications data, where the government has long maintained that the gap in capabilities are putting lives at risk"". So it is both sweeping and vague, promising to give the authorities the tools they need to track criminals in a complex online world without specifying as yet how far they will be allowed to go. image copyright Thinkstock The Open Rights Group (ORG), which campaigns against increased surveillance, is convinced this is the return of the so-called Snooper's Charter, with increased powers of data collection and retention aimed at the entire population, coupled with attacks on encryption. The ORG's executive director Jim Killock thinks the bill will have two aims - codifying existing practices by the intelligence agencies uncovered by Edward Snowden and expanding data retention by ISPs.  But he believes that the increasing use of encryption by the likes of Google and Facebook means that ordering ISPs to store their customers' data won't be enough: ""There's going to be a very interesting discussion about whether government can break encryption or order companies to break it."" Those at the sharp end - the ISPs - are more circumspect in their response to the government's plans. Their trade body ISPA put out a statement welcoming the fact that the government had promised to factor in the independent Anderson review of the laws on intercepting communications data. But it warned of the need to ""properly balance security, privacy, costs to industry and to preserve the UK's reputation as a leading place to do business online"".  The ISPs also suspect that plans to attack encryption could be on the agenda.  The government has a clear election mandate, and is under pressure from the police and intelligence agencies to give them more capabilities in their online battles. But the opposition to its plans - if they do involve cracking the codes that keep online communication secret - will be intense. And it is likely to come not so much from opposition politicians, but from the global technology giants.  Related Topics Cyber-security National security"
encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-32814309|"LogJam encryption flaw fix will block some websites By Leo Kelion Technology desk editor Published 20 May 2015 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption The LogJam attack vulnerability could mean encrypted communications could still be spied upon Web-browser makers are preparing a fix for a flaw in an encryption algorithm that makes it possible to spy on supposedly secure communications. However, the updates will mean a minority of websites will be blocked by the new software. The "" LogJam attack"" was discovered by researchers  at Microsoft and a number of US and French universities. They believe about  8% of the top one million HTTPS security-protected sites  are made vulnerable by the flaw. Users would therefore be given false reassurance by the padlock icon that such sites display in a browser's address bar. Some email servers and services that use the Transport Layer Security (TLS) cryptographic protocol are also at risk of being hacked until their operators update their systems. Export controls The LogJam attack vulnerability is a legacy of the US 1990s-era export restrictions on cryptographic tools. These limited the complexity of the secret encryption codes that could be generated by ""international versions"" of US-made software, including Netscape's web browser. The export rules were later relaxed, but the researchers say an unintended consequence is that a commonly used process, called a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, can be compromised by a ""man-in-the-middle"" attack. image copyright Thinkstock image caption The flaw allows hackers to make target systems use a weaker than desired encryption key A Diffie-Hellman key exchange was one of the first techniques developed to allow two or more parties to create and share an encryption key by exchanging parts of the key in public.  What the researchers discovered was that by intercepting the communications, a hacker could ensure a 512-bit key was used rather than a more complicated one. In this context, 512-bit means there are two to the power of 512 possible combinations - representing a huge number. Nevertheless, the researchers said it was still possible for computers to crack such codes in ""minutes"". Even more complicated types of encryption were susceptible to cyber-spies using supercomputers at the National Security Agency, they added. ""In the 1024-bit case, we estimate that such computations are plausible given nation-state resources, and a close reading of published NSA leaks shows that the agency's attacks on VPNs [virtual private networks] are consistent with having achieved such a break,"" they wrote. Nevertheless, the fix that web-browser makers have agreed on is that their software should block 512-bit or weaker encryption keys. image caption Users may not be able to access some website after they upgrade their browser ""The solution is relatively simple - you disable this legacy function on your system,"" said Prof Alan Woodward, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Surrey. ""Unfortunately, some older web servers might then be prevented from starting a secure conversation with the updated web browsers as they would support only that older, shorter, weaker key lengths.  ""But do you really want this backward compatibility if it means others could be forced to use this weaker form of encryption? ""Browsers can be updated and servers can be reconfigured easily, and it really is no bad thing to force this to happen bearing in mind the alternative is that a 'secure connection"" could potentially be broken by an eavesdropper."" According to a report by the Wall Street Journal , it has been estimated that 20,000 websites could become blocked as a consequence. 'Storm in a teacup' Mozilla - which is responsible for the Firefox browser - said its new software should be released in the ""next few days"". image copyright Getty Images image caption The NSA is thought to be capable of breaking 1024-bit encryption ""Most of the coordination in this case was done thanks to the researchers who found the bug. They provided valuable measurement data to the various browser vendors, which allowed us all to calibrate our response,"" said Richard Barnes, the organisation's cryptographic engineering manager. Another security expert said that internet users should not be worried about being unprotected in the meantime. ""The fact that LogJam can only be exploited when hackers and targets are on the same network, as well as patches being imminent, means that hype around it is likely to be a bit of a storm in a teacup,"" said Ross Brewer, from security research company LogRhythm. ""Organisations should, however, use flaws like this as an excuse to give themselves a security health check.  ""With flaws like LogJam being identified with increasing frequency, the only real way to know you're safe is to know you can stop an attack in its tracks as soon as it gets going.""

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25670315|"2014: The year of encryption By Paul Rubens Technology reporter Published 10 January 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Thinkstock image caption Companies are under pressure in the current environment to make sure their encryption is up to scratch ""The solution to government surveillance is to encrypt everything.""  So said Eric Schmidt, Google's chairman, in response to revelations about the activities of the US National Security Agency (NSA) made by whistle-blower  Edward Snowden . Schmidt's advice appears to have been heeded by companies that provide internet-based services.  Microsoft, for instance, says it will have ""best-in-class industry cryptography"" in place for services including Outlook.com, Office 365 and SkyDrive by the end of the year, while Yahoo has announced plans to encrypt all of its customers' data, including emails, by the end of the first quarter of 2014. For many smaller businesses too, 2014 is likely to be the year of encryption. That's certainly the view of Dave Frymier, chief information security officer at Unisys, a Pennsylvania-based IT company.  But he believes the driving force for this will be different: not government surveillance programmes, but the threat of attacks from hackers.  Diamonds and paperclips Rather than encrypting everything, Mr Frymier advocates that companies identify what he believes is the 5%-15% of their data that is really confidential, and use encryption to protect just that.  He says employees should then be barred from accessing this data using standard desktop and laptop machines or their own smartphones or tablets, which can easily be infected with malware. Access would be restricted to employees using secure ""hardened"" computers. image copyright other image caption Dave Frymier from Unisys says the threat posed by hackers will drive firms to invest in encryption ""When you look at the increasing sophistication of malware, it becomes apparent that you need to establish highly protected enclaves of data. The only way to achieve that is through modern encryption, properly implemented,"" says Mr Frymier.  ""You can split your data into diamonds and paperclips, and the important thing is to encrypt the diamonds, and not to sweat the paperclips."" Prakash Panjwani, a general manager at Maryland-based data protection company Safenet, also believes that the large number of high-profile data breaches in 2013 - including hacker attacks on  US retailer Target ,  software maker Adobe , and  photo messaging service Snapchat  - means that 2014 will inevitably be a bumper one for encryption vendors.  ""Snowden has focused attention on surveillance issues, but the real threat is organised crime and the number of data breaches that are occurring,"" he says.  ""Companies are going to come under extreme pressure from boards, customers and regulators in 2014 to take action so that if there is a data breach they can say, 'We didn't lose any data because it was encrypted.'"" Keeping the regulator happy A large number of companies already use encryption to protect the data they store on their own systems ""at rest"", as well as data ""in flight"" as it is sent over networks to customers, other data centres, or for processing or storage in the cloud.  image copyright Thinkstock image caption Using a longer encryption key will make it harder for hackers to access your data But Ramon Krikken, an analyst at Gartner, believes that the way encryption is used by many of these companies is likely to change in 2014.  ""Companies are certainly going to have to take encryption more seriously thanks to the Snowden revelations,"" he says.  ""At the moment many companies are using encryption for compliance reasons, not for security. They are not using it to protect their data, but because it is the easiest way to comply with regulations: encryption is the auditor's and the regulator's favourite check box item."" 'Back doors' One question that companies will need to consider is which encryption algorithm or cipher to use to best encrypt their data. It's an important question as some older ciphers can now be ""cracked"" relatively quickly using the computing power in a standard desktop PC.   And there is a question mark over whether the NSA may have deliberately used its influence to weaken some encryption systems - or even to introduce ""back doors"" that provide easy access to encrypted data to anyone who knows of their existence.  ""The problem is that even if you can inspect the source code, it is certainly not a given that you would be able to spot a back door,"" Mr Krikken says.  image copyright AFP image caption US whistle-blower Edward Snowden's revelations have made companies take encryption more seriously He believes it is more important to establish where all the parts of an encryption solution come from.  ""If you procure software or hardware from overseas, from a country with a government which does not have your best interests at heart, you need to remember that it may not be as secure as you think,"" Mr Krikken says.  ""So you have to decide who you trust, and find out where the vendor gets all the parts of its product from."" Don't be cheap Another thing companies need to consider when they implement encryption is how strong the encryption should be. Using a longer encryption key makes it harder for hackers or governments to crack the encryption, but it also requires more computing power.  But Robert Former, senior security consultant for Neohapsis, an Illinois-based security services company, says many companies are overestimating the computational complexity of encryption.  ""If you have an Apple Mac, your processor spends far more time making OS X looks pretty than it does doing crypto work."" He therefore recommends using encryption keys that are two or even four times longer than the ones many companies are currently using.  ""I say use the strongest cryptography that your hardware and software can support.

Speaking to reporters, FBI boss James Comey said the plans to enable encryption by default could thwart law enforcement investigations. Lives could depend on police forces continuing to get access to the data on devices used by criminals and terrorists, he said. The FBI was talking to both Apple and Google about its fears, said Mr Comey. Protect privacy The conversations with tech firms needed to be had before the day when police forces lost access to those devices, he said. ""I'd hate to have people look at me and say, 'Well how come you can't save this kid?' 'How come you can't do this thing?'"" said Mr Comey in a briefing. His comments came in reaction to a decision by Apple to enable a file encryption system on its iOS 8 software for which it has no keys. This means it would not be able to comply with any official request to help police get at the data on those devices. Google has said it too is planning to enable a similar encryption system by default on the next version of Android. Mr Comey said he was ""very concerned"" about these plans because of what they would allow people to do. ""What concerns me about this is companies marketing something expressly to allow people to place themselves beyond the law,"" he said. ""I am a huge believer in the rule of law, but I am also a believer that no-one in this country is beyond the law,"" he added. Apple and Google have yet to respond to Mr Comey's comments. Ten days prior to Mr Comey's press statement, iOS data forensics expert Jonathan Zdziarski pointed out that Apple's encryption system would not stop police getting at data on portable devices.  Specifically weakening security systems just to aid the police was a bad decision, he said. ""For the sake of privacy and overall security, the only logical solution is to make products as secure as possible, and let good detective work do the crime solving, rather than an easy button,""  he wrote in a blogpost .

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29276955|"Google and Apple to introduce default encryption By Joe Miller Technology Reporter Published 19 September 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright Google image caption Google's devices have offered the option of encryption, but many users did not make use of the feature Google has announced that its next mobile operating system, Android L, will encrypt users' data by default. The measure will make it more difficult for private information to be hacked or handed to law enforcement agencies.  On Thursday, Apple said that devices running its new iOS8 software would be encrypted by default, with even the company itself unable to gain access. Both firms have offered encryption for some time, but many users were unaware of its existence or had not enabled it. Earlier this week, Apple's boss Tim Cook  posted an online message  assuring users the company's philosophy was that a ""great customer experience shouldn't come at the expense of your privacy"". Swipe As well as announcing default encryption for all devices running the new iOS8 software, Mr Cook took a thinly veiled swipe at Google, saying that Apple would not use its customers' information to sell things to them. ""We don't 'monetise' the information you store on your iPhone or in iCloud,"" he wrote, ""and we don't read your email or your messages to get information to market to you."" He added that although Apple does have an advertising business, called iAd, the function can be disabled by users. Shortly after, Google announced its stance on privacy, also embracing default encryption. A spokesman said: ""For over three years, Android has offered encryption, and keys are not stored off of the device, so they cannot be shared with law enforcement.  ""As part of our next Android release, encryption will be enabled by default out of the box, so you won't even have to think about turning it on."" Both Apple and Google follow in the footsteps of the now somewhat beleaguered Blackberry, which has encrypted data by default for some time.  The firms' focus on privacy comes after nude photos of celebrities were leaked online earlier this month. The breach, which affected actress Jennifer Lawrence, among others, was linked by some security experts to vulnerabilities in Apple's iCloud storage service.  Law enforcement  The introduction of default encryption also protects US firms from having to hand over data to law enforcement agencies. As the companies themselves do not have access to users' passwords, which unlock the encryption, they are not actually in possession of the data concerned. Several of the largest US tech firms have been fighting government requests for their users' private data, including Microsoft, Google, Twitter, Facebook and Dropbox. David Emm, a senior researcher at security firm Kaspersky Lab, told the BBC that automatic encryption was ""probably more about privacy than about protection"". ""Customers will find some reassurance in the fact that their data can't routinely fall into third-party hands,"" he said. However he added that the measure only ""applies to stuff on a [Apple or Android] device, but not necessarily to stuff you put in the cloud, which could still be accessible to law enforcement agencies"".

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-27974877|"Do quantum computers threaten global encryption systems? By Mark Ward Technology correspondent, BBC News Published 12 August 2014 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image copyright SPL The modern world is a house of cards built upon encryption. Make a mobile phone call and encryption is there to stop eavesdroppers listening in. Spend money online and encryption ensures your card number and identity cannot be scooped up and used elsewhere. And the money that keeps global banking systems lubricated only does so thanks to cryptographic software that turns a stream of data into unintelligible nonsense.  Remove all that encryption and the whole lot comes tumbling down. If that happens we might return to an era when commerce was mostly done face-to-face and based around who you know. Scrambled Yet quantum computers - another modern marvel - are threatening to make this doomsday scenario a reality. Why? ""Because of the possibilities for massive parallelism,"" says Prof Mark Manulis, a cryptographic expert from the University of Surrey's department of computing. In other words, because of a quantum computer's potential ability to do trillions of calculations a second. When a message is scrambled with a modern encryption system, the keys used to lock it are typically very large numbers - tens, if not hundreds, of digits long.  Finding that key means using a computer to carry out lots of sums and then trying each answer to see if it unlocks a message an attacker is interested in.  image caption If encryption fails then we might return to a very different type of commerce The sheer number of possible answers lends protection because it would take centuries, or longer, to find the right key.  Unless large-scale quantum computers are commonplace, says Prof Manulis. Quantum computers can crank through those sums so fast because their basic building blocks, known as qubits, can be used to represent both a zero and a one at the same time. By contrast the computational elements, bits, of the classical computers under our desks and on our laps represent either a zero or a one. Not both. The curious properties of the quantum realm mean that when those qubits work together you get a vast rise in computational power - hence the potential they have to speed things up, find keys and crack codes.  Number crunching  Most significantly affected by the arrival of quantum computers are the public key infrastructure (PKI) systems we use to establish secure channels of communication online. Typically, when you turn up at a website it is PKI that sets up the initial connection. With that secure channel created, different encryption systems that are much less susceptible to attack by quantum computers are used to protect data shuttling back and forth. ""Public key cryptography is based on problems from number theory, integer factorisation and discrete logarithms, that will be broken once we have powerful quantum computers,"" said Prof Manulis. image copyright D-Wave image caption Canadian firm D-Wave sells a working quantum computer The key word here is ""once"".  But that once might be a long time coming, believes Dr Stephan Ritter, who studies quantum computers at the Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics in Garching, Germany. ""Quantum computers are not very powerful at the moment but they have this potential, and that's what this is about,"" he told the BBC.  ""Experimentally I would say that we are at the stage where it's not even clear which physical elements they will be made of."" Researchers have yet to agree on the best way to build these qubits and how to link them together. So far, Dr Ritter says, only quantum computers with a small handful of qubits have been made - a long way from the hundreds and thousands needed to make it able to do useful work and do it quickly. ""There are proofs of concept of these building blocks but they all have advantages or disadvantages, so it's unclear which will be the best as we go forward,"" he says. Controversial Despite what Dr Ritter sees as a lack of progress, Canadian firm D-Wave will sell you a working quantum computer if you have $15m (Â£8.9m) to spare.  The way it operates is controversial and its price suggests it will not be the widely available device that can crack all our codes. Even when they are available, says Dr Ritter, we should not think of them as wonder machines that speed up any and every batch processing job or database search. Purest-ever silicon in quantum fix image copyright NIST image caption US scientists have created a very pure form of silicon-28, an essential component of a quantum computer ""They are good for very specific tasks,"" he says, ""but not everything is faster with a quantum computer and there will be many tasks you will not use one for at all.""  As a result we should have a few years yet to update and improve our encryption systems as research and development work on quantum computers continues. 'Badly broken' That's just as well, says Dr Tanja Lange, a coding theory and cryptology expert from the Technical University of Eindhoven, as it can take a long time for older encryption systems to be swapped out in favour of more secure alternatives.  For instance, she says, it took five to six years to swap out the widely used MD5 data scrambling system once its weakness was demonstrated through a viable attack. Timescales can stretch for systems already used widely in the field, such as those found in cash machines, smart cards and mobile phones. ""However, if a system is absolutely badly broken, roll-out can be faster,"" she says. ""RSA sent new tokens promptly after they had a break-in and credit card companies are used to replacing cards if there is a risk that they were compromised."" image copyright PA image caption Encryption ensures that no-one can listen in to you while you walk and talk What will be harder, she says, is migrating everyone to the software systems that can resist attack by quantum computer. At the very least such systems require much bigger encryption keys and that means they are much less efficient - for which read, slower. ""We hope that with another three to five years of research we can design systems that are smaller, but we're not there yet,"" she says.  ""Currently we can give you a tank with concrete enforcement - it's secure but big. ""We hope to find a way to give you a secure sports car with airbags, ABS and all that neatly hidden away in a sleek design.""

The consumer group  says devices being sold on marketplaces  such as Amazon and eBay, could easily be  hacked or switched off by criminals.  It is asking the government for new legislation to safeguard consumers.  Amazon has removed at least seven product listings in response to the findings.  'He used our smart doorbell camera to track me' Ring logs every doorbell press and app action The watchdog tested 11 devices which were purchased from popular online marketplaces in the UK. Brands included Qihoo, Ctronics and Victure.  It found that among the most common flaws were weak password policies, and a lack of data encryption.  Two of the devices in the test could be manipulated to steal network passwords and then hack other smart devices within the home.  Amazon UK's current number one bestseller in smart doorbells, the Victure Smart Video Doorbell, was found to send users' home network names and passwords unencrypted to servers in China.  The BBC has asked Victure for comment.  Convenience v Security Lisa Forte, a partner at Red Goat Cyber Security, which specialises in cyber-security testing, said consumers may inadvertently be putting convenience before security.  ""Generally speaking the more convenient something is, the less secure it is,"" she told the BBC.  ""The more connected devices you have in your home, the more 'doors' there are for cyber-criminals to open.

By Alistair Coleman and Shayan Sardarizadeh BBC Monitoring Published 19 January Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics US Capitol riots image copyright Getty Images Mass armed protests initially called for by some extreme Trump supporters in the lead-up to inauguration day have so far not materialised, following an apparent change of heart by the groups involved.  One flyer shared on Gab, a Twitter-like platform popular with far-right groups, had called for armed protests in Washington and 50 state capitals ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration. The plans prompted a  warning from the FBI . But in recent days those calls have been reversed and a new theory put forward on fringe platforms - that plans for armed protests were instead a ""trap"" set up by the FBI, or supporters of the left-wing Antifa or Black Lives Matter (BLM) groups. Some of these discussions have been happening on less popular and less public online platforms, where many Trump supporters from far-right and conspiracy groups have migrated after being  kicked off Facebook and Twitter  in the wake of the Capitol riots on 6 January. The vast majority of armed rallies that were initially being promoted have so far not gone ahead following the warnings.  On Sunday, despite earlier fears of violence, there were only a few armed protesters in front of state capitols in several states, including Michigan and Ohio. Those who did turn out were not dedicated Trump supporters but mainly members of the extreme libertarian Boogaloo Bois movement, whose followers advocate an armed overthrow of government.  Who are the Boogaloo Bois? A lone MAGA protester left his sign near the statehouse in Trenton after he realized no one else showed up to the pro-Trump state capital rally today.  pic.twitter.com/hUj6FvlW2U — Matt Katz (@mattkatz00)  January 17, 2021   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter Despite a continued belief in unsubstantiated claims of election fraud, many of Mr Trump's supporters seem resigned to the reality that Mr Biden will be inaugurated as president on Wednesday. Although some claim they will never accept him as their president. Alongside the new online warnings to avoid armed protests in Washington DC and elsewhere, there are a few posts by furious supporters of the president calling for ""guerrilla warfare"". The lack of armed protests for now could be down to ""increased fear about crackdowns by law enforcement following the 6 January,"" says Alex Newhouse, research lead at the Center on Terrorism, Extremism, and Counterterrorism in the US. He also warns of a different kind of threat from the Capitol riots: ""The level of desensitisation to concepts like race war, civil war, and political violence that occurs in these chatrooms means that if even a tiny fraction of 1% of followers take it seriously, that could indicate a higher potential of individual acts of extreme violence.""  image copyright Getty Images image caption Influential QAnon figures were among those who broke into the Capitol And what about the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, which has been blamed for radicalising so many and whose members were among those that stormed the Capitol?  QAnon followers remain convinced that somehow Mr Trump, with the help of the military, will successfully overturn the outcome of the election on inauguration day. What is QAnon? They believe Mr Trump will invoke the Insurrection Act, a rarely used 1807 law that allows the president to deploy military forces inside the US. There is no evidence to suggest this could happen.  Followers of the conspiracy have also been sharing false or doctored images and videos of the fencing around the Capitol building - built to ensure the safety of those attending the inauguration and avoid a repeat of the 6 January riots - with claims the fencing is in fact a military prison which will be used to entrap Mr Biden and members of the so-called ""deep state"". Who are Proud Boys and antifa? The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol   There's also an increasing sense of paranoia. Groups on alternative platforms that openly called for violence on 6 January now worry aloud that they have been infiltrated by government agents or left-wing activists.  Owners and moderators of right-wing social media platforms have posted messages asking members not to post incitement to violence. image copyright Getty Images image caption Pro-Trump supporters banned from mainstreams apps are finding alternative online homes But violent threats against House speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, and Republican Vice-President Mike Pence, whom the groups had hoped would overturn the election result, remain widespread. The move away from mainstream platforms poses a risk, according to Mina al-Lami, jihadism specialist at BBC Monitoring, who sees parallels with Islamist militant groups who have been subject to similar crackdowns. ""Members of the fringe far-right may now slip under the radar into closed spaces which use end-to-end encryption,"" a very secure method of exchanging messages, she says. ""Their radicalisation goes unchecked and unmonitored.""  The social media giants acted to remove QAnon groups after the violence in Washington, but they have quickly rebuilt themselves elsewhere.  On Gab, groups dedicated to QAnon now boast more than 500,000 members. A similar new channel on Telegram has more than 100,000 subscribers.  Meanwhile, accounts spreading conspiracy theories and potentially inciting violence have emerged in surprising places. TikTok, the short-form video platform hugely popular among young people, has seen a flood of clips from pro-Trump militia groups. TikTok videos from militia groups are concerning, says Ciaran O'Connor of the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, a think tank focused on extremism and hate groups.  Users have been sharing footage of members preparing firearms, as well as promoting false claims that President Trump has activated the Insurrection Act. Stop the steal: The roots of Trump's voter fraud claims Who broke into the Capitol building during the riots? Extremist supporters have been taking advantage of TikTok's slow moderation process, which means that videos can stay online for long periods of time before they are deleted for violating the network's terms of service, Mr O'Connor says. Some of the more violent and conspiratorial pro-Trump groups may have been scattered across the internet following purges at mainstream platforms, but that doesn't mean they've gone away.

The first priority is to fill in gaps in broadband coverage where ground infrastructure cannot reach, but later it will power services such as self-driving cars.  The project will in some ways mirror America's Starlink and the UK-Indian OneWeb networks. Its scope has yet to be fully defined.  A consortium of aerospace and telecoms companies is doing that right now. But EU Internal Market Commissioner Thierry Breton said he wanted to get going on the idea as soon as possible. ""My objective is to go fast. And therefore it would be appropriate that the Commission puts forward this year a proposal to the European Parliament and the Council so we can move concretely,""  he told the 13th European Space Conference  on Tuesday. ""To be ready, we launched a few weeks ago a study on a secure space-based connectivity system. The selected consortium consisting of European satellite manufacturers, operators and service providers, telco operators and launch service providers will study the possible design and development of this project.

EU officials have only spoken in the broadest terms about what they want to see from the new telecommunications project.  They talk about a mix of low, medium and geostationary satellites that use advanced quantum encryption, are interlinked with optical connectors, and which piggyback sensors that might also be used to monitor aviation and shipping - just as examples. But, they argue, fast, secure, low-latency, space-borne connectivity will be the must-have capability to enable a raft of coming technologies, such as self-driving cars.   Europe needs such a capability if it wants to stay globally competitive.  The primary motivation in the first instance, however, would be to fill those last ""not spots"" in member states where ground infrastructure is incapable of delivering broadband services - thought to be at least five million households. image copyright EC image caption Breton: A proposal to the European Parliament and the Council by the year's end Pressed on cost, EU officials told reporters on Tuesday that any estimate would have to wait on the industrial consortium's report in the spring. Nonetheless, experience says it would be in the billions of euros price bracket. And as to where the money will come from to make it all happen, the preferred option seems to be some sort of public-private partnership. The officials said the commission had some funds across its various directorates that it could call on, but that they expected industry, individual member states and the European Space Agency to invest in the system as well. Whatever the system looks like and however it is funded, speed of implementation will be paramount.  The Starlink broadband mega-constellation, which is being built by US entrepreneur Elon Musk's SpaceX company, has already started offering ""beta"", or trial, broadband connections in Northern Europe; and OneWeb, owned by Indian conglomerate Bharti Global and the British government, hopes to have an initial offering for its Northern European customers later this year. ""From the first idea about Galileo through to the first operational service in Europe, it has taken 20 years; we don't have 20 years [for this new project],"" observed Jean-Marc Nasr, the head of Airbus Space Systems, which leads the feasibility consortium. ""Speed is of the essence here. The idea of the European space infrastructure has been on the table since early 2020. We cannot have the first service in 2040. If we do that, we are dead.

""We need funding, we need a vision, we need leadership, but also we need frequency rights to sustain the launch of a European low-Earth orbit constellation,"" he told the conference.

encryption|http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-24667834|"How the modern world depends on encryption By Mark Ward Technology correspondent, BBC News Published 25 October 2013 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing image caption Encryption helps to ensure that credit card transactions stay secure Encryption makes the modern world go round. Every time you make a mobile phone call, buy something with a credit card in a shop or on the web, or even get cash from an ATM, encryption bestows upon that transaction the confidentiality and security to make it possible. ""If you consider electronic transactions and online payments, all those would not be possible without encryption,"" said Dr Mark Manulis, a senior lecturer in cryptography at the University of Surrey.  At its simplest encryption is all about transforming intelligible numbers or text, sounds and images into a stream of nonsense.  There are many, many ways to perform that transformation, some straightforward and some very complex. Most involve swapping letters for numbers and use maths to do the transformation. However, no matter which method is used the resulting scrambled data stream should give no hints about how it was encrypted.  During World War II, the Allies scored some notable victories against the Germans because their encryption systems did not sufficiently scramble messages. Rigorous mathematical analysis by Allied code crackers laid bare patterns hidden within the messages and used them to recreate the machine used to encrypt them. Those codes revolved around the use of secret keys that were shared among those who needed to communicate securely. These are known as symmetric encryption systems and have a weakness in that everyone involved has to possess the same set of secret keys.  In the modern era, a need has arisen to communicate securely with people and organisations we do not know and with whom we cannot easily share secret keys, said Dr Manulis. This need has given rise to public-key cryptography. Despite the formidable name it encapsulates a simple idea.  image caption Wartime code-cracking machines such as Colossus broke German encryption systems Essentially, it allows anyone to send a message that only one person (or company or website or gadget) can unlock. It does this using two keys: one public, one private. The public key is used to lock a message. Anyone can get hold of that public key but once a message is locked with it, that message can only be opened with the corresponding private key.  Typically these keys are large numbers and the security of the system depends on the fact that some mathematical operations are easier than others.  For instance, it is far easier to multiply numbers together (public key and plain text message) to get a result than it is to start with that result (the scrambled message) and work backwards. Complicated mathematics guarantees that the right private key will unscramble a message. Far harder, even for the fastest computer, is starting with that result (the scrambled message) and searching through all the possible combinations of numbers that could produce it. ""Because of the size of the keys is so huge its impossible for an attacker to search through the key space with the resources they usually have,"" he said. Such ""brute force"" attacks are pretty much doomed no matter how much computer power attackers bring to bear, he said  Typically the numbers used in these mathematical encryption systems are tens if not hundreds of digits long. This makes it impossible, to all intents and purposes, to search through all potential keys in a reasonable amount of time. The web and many other modern communication systems employ a hybrid approach, said Dr Manulis, because public key encryption is not very computationally efficient compared to symmetric key encryption. image caption Even supercomputers would not break the strongest encryption algorithms On the web, the relatively slower public key cryptography is used initially to establish a secure connection between you and a website. The symmetric system would be no good for this step because there is no way to securely swap the secret key. However, with a secure channel in place, the faster symmetric system can be used to share a key and then scramble the data passing back and forth.  On mobiles, a similar system is used and encryption keys are held on a handset's sim card to help keep chatter scrambled.  Vulnerabilities Attacks on these encryption systems take many forms, said Dr Manulis.  ""You do not need to break the communication system if you have some spy software on the end point,"" he said. In addition, weaknesses have been found in the software used to encapsulate them on computers and phones.  ""The algorithms are mathematically proven,"" he said, "" and if there's any problem then it usually comes in the implementation of the algorithm."" In addition, there have been suggestions that the NSA has subverted the process of creating encryption algorithms, to make them easier for it to break. Official agencies can also force firms, be they websites or mobile operators, to surrender their private keys so they can eavesdrop on supposedly secure communications. Some have sought to get make encryption more secure by using a technique known as end-to-end encryption.  This differs from more standard systems which can be vulnerable because their scrambling system is, in software terms, separate from the program used to create a message.  If attackers insert themselves between the message making software and the encryption system at either end of a conversation they will see information before it is scrambled. End-to-end encryption closes this gap by having the message making software apply the scrambling directly. In addition, many of these systems run a closed network so messages never travel over the public internet and are only decrypted when they reach their intended recipient. image caption Some fear that sending data over public networks makes it more susceptible to surveillance Related Internet Links Dr Mark Manulis The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites."

encryption|https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52152025|"Zoom 'unsuitable' for government secrets, researchers say By David Molloy & Joe Tidy BBC News Published 3 April 2020 Share close Share page Copy link About sharing Related Topics Coronavirus pandemic image copyright AFP image caption The UK Cabinet has been meeting via Zoom - something researchers say may not be ideal The hugely popular video meetings app Zoom has ""significant weaknesses"" which might make it unsuitable for secrets. A team at The Citizen Lab found that Zoom was using a non-standard type of encryption, and transmitting information through China. Government use - such as Boris Johnson's use of the app for Cabinet meetings - may not be wise, the researchers warned. But the app is fine for keeping in touch for most people, they said. Until recently, Zoom was used mainly by large businesses for video conference calls. But the explosion in users during the coronavirus pandemic has created ""a new gold rush for cyber-spies"", The Citizen Lab's report said. It warned that Zoom ""may not be suitable"" for: Governments and businesses worried about espionage Healthcare providers handling sensitive patient information Activists, lawyers and journalists working on sensitive topics But for people using Zoom for contacting friends, holding social events or organising courses or lectures, ""our findings should not necessarily be concerning"", the report said. Analysis: Still fine for most By Joe Tidy, Cyber-security Reporter Zoom says there are now 200 million meetings held on it every day, and despite the serious flaws uncovered in this latest report, it's probably safe to say that 199 million of them are not in danger.  The Citizen Lab has shown compelling evidence here that it is possible to collect all the data of a video meeting and then partially unscramble it to find out, roughly, what was said and what was seen.  UK government defends PM's use of Zoom Zoom is in everyone's living room - how safe is it? However, it would take a huge amount of time and effort for a hacker to achieve this - and it simply wouldn't be worth the effort for an average work huddle or friendly pub quiz held on the service. It's the high-level talks at company board level, or in government, that will be targeted.  The government has been led by the National Cyber Security Centre and other security experts on this since the beginning. The goal has always been to allow for open and smooth communications to take place, but this research may well lead to the advice on Zoom changing fast.  ""Zoom has made the classic mistake of designing and implementing their own encryption scheme, rather than using one of the existing standards for encrypting voice and video content,"" said Bill Marczak, a Research Fellow at The Citizen Lab. ""To be sure, Zoom's encryption is better than none at all, but users expecting their Zoom meetings to be safe from espionage should think twice before using the app to discuss sensitive information."" The research has not taken the security services in the UK by surprise and it is understood that a project is working ""at pace"" to adapt existing communication systems to the demands of home working and security. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre issued a statement saying: ""Zoom is being used to enable unclassified crisis COVID-19 communications in the current unprecedented circumstances. Assured services are in place for more sensitive communications and the provision of these services is being widened given the demands of much greater remote working."" The government is not disclosing which meetings are eligible for Zoom and which ones are not. As an example, the BBC was told that Zoom is safe for Cabinet-level discussions but not for emergency Cobra meetings.  A Chinese 'heart' for the US company Aside from the encryption standards, the researchers also found that Zoom sends traffic to China - even when all the people in a Zoom meeting are outside of China. ""During multiple test calls in North America, we observed keys for encrypting and decrypting meetings transmitted to servers in Beijing, China,"" the report said. image copyright EPA image caption Zoom remains hugely popular despite the concerns expressed in some quarters The report also pointed to the strong involvement of Chinese firms in the company. Zoom has its headquarters in the US, but has about 700 employees across three companies in mainland China working on the app's development. Zoom apologises for security issues, promises fixes Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars ""Running development out of China likely saves Zoom having to pay Silicon Valley salaries, reducing their expenses and increasing their profit margin. However, this arrangement could also open up Zoom to pressure from Chinese authorities,"" the report said. A 'roll your own' approach The team said there are mixed and confusing messages around the type of encryption that Zoom actually uses. In some places, it tells users that it uses ""end-to-end"" encryption - the gold standard for secure messaging, which makes it impossible for the service, or any other middlemen, to access data. In its documentation, Zoom has said it uses a type of encryption called AES-256.  But the researchers said this is not true. Instead, Zoom has ""rolled their own"" encryption - using a variant of something called AES-128 in ""ECB mode"". Among security researchers, ECB mode ""is well understood to be a bad idea"", because it preserves some of the patterns of the original,  the report said . image copyright Wikimedia image caption The report highlighted that ""ECB mode"" preserves patterns, and is ""a bad idea"" The report also says that Zoom does not use end-to-end encryption ""as most people understand the term"". Instead, it uses ""transport"" encryption between devices and servers. ""Because Zoom does not implement true end-to-end encryption, they have the theoretical ability to decrypt and monitor Zoom calls,"" the report said. But it noted that Zoom itself has already addressed this concern, promising that they have never built such a mechanism, even if it is theoretically possible. During their research, the team was able to extract a still image from a video meeting using the encryption key. Zoom clarified its encryption policy  on 1 April, apologising for incorrectly suggesting that meetings were capable of end-to-end encryption. It also moved to quell fears about privacy and security issues, promising to spend the next 90 days exclusively working on  ""trust, safety, and privacy issues"". Alan Woodward, a professor of computer science at Surrey University, told the BBC that a major fix is needed.  ""I don't believe this is something that Zoom can just add to their list of jobs to do in the next 90 days. It's possible, but this requires a re-engineering of the way they encrypt their calls, so it's a major undertaking.""  Prof Woodward added: ""I would not use Zoom for any sensitive or secret discussions.""

In an advisory note to its developer customers, RSA said that a community-developed algorithm in one of its toolkits could contain a vulnerability. It ""strongly recommends"" switching to other random number generators instead. The warning came from the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. The advice comes in the wake of  New York Times allegations  that the NSA may have intentionally introduced a flaw into the algorithm - known as Dual Elliptic Curve Deterministic Random Bit Generation - and then tried to get it adopted as a security standard by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology. Privacy In the 1990s, the NSA tried to claim the right to unlock all encryption systems, but lost the battle after privacy rights and freedom of speech advocates objected. The NSA maintains that it needs to be able to decipher encrypted communications to protect the US against terrorism and organised crime. image caption A replica of Alan Turing's Bombe decryption machine used during WWII: Throughout history governments have tried to decipher secret messages As the documents leaked by the former government security contractor Edward Snowden have demonstrated, the NSA has been intercepting communications data from all over the world through its Prism surveillance programme. But it is locked in a continuous battle with cryptographers who are developing increasingly sophisticated security systems. One of the NSA's tactics has been to persuade leading technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to co-operate with the security services in providing access to user data. Privacy rights campaigners have been concerned over how far this co-operation may extend.  Under US law, service providers have to hand over user data to the NSA but are not allowed to publish how many security-related data requests they receive. A growing number of providers are beginning to stand up to the government and demand more transparency. For example, the Digital Due Process Coalition, which is calling for reform of the 1986 US Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), includes companies such as Apple, Google, Facebook, Amazon, Linkedin and Microsoft. The coalition argues that the ECPA has been outpaced by the rapid rise of the internet and the explosion of digital data.

Disclosures by leaker Edward Snowden allege the US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK's GCHQ successfully decoded key online security protocols. They suggest some internet companies provided the agencies backdoor access to their security systems. The NSA is said to spend $250m (Â£160m) a year on the top-secret operation. It is codenamed Bullrun, an American civil-war battle, according to the documents  published by the Guardian  in conjunction with the New York Times and ProPublica. The British counterpart scheme run by GCHQ is called Edgehill, after the first major engagement of the English civil war, say the documents. 'Behind-the-scenes persuasion' The reports say the UK and US intelligence agencies are focusing on the encryption used in 4G smartphones, email, online shopping and remote business communication networks. The encryption techniques are used by internet services such as Google, Facebook and Yahoo. Under Bullrun, it is said that the NSA has built powerful supercomputers to try to crack the technology that scrambles and encrypts personal information when internet users log on to access various services. The NSA also collaborated with unnamed technology companies to build so-called back doors into their software - something that would give the government access to information before it is encrypted and sent over the internet, it is reported.  As well as supercomputers, methods used include ""technical trickery, court orders and behind-the-scenes persuasion to undermine the major tools protecting the privacy of everyday communications"", the  New York Times reports . The US reportedly began investing billions of dollars in the operation in 2000 after its initial efforts to install a ""back door"" in all encryption systems were thwarted. 'Gobsmacked' During the next decade, it is said the NSA employed code-breaking computers and began collaborating with technology companies at home and abroad to build entry points into their products.  The documents provided to the Guardian by Mr Snowden do not specify which companies participated. The NSA also hacked into computers to capture messages prior to encryption, and used broad influence to introduce weaknesses into encryption standards followed by software developers the world over, the New York Times reports. media caption Computer scientist Dr Herb Lin says he is surprised by the scale of the alleged hacking When British analysts were first told of the extent of the scheme they were ""gobsmacked"", according to one memo among more than 50,000 documents shared by the Guardian. NSA officials continue to defend the agency's actions, claiming it will put the US at considerable risk if messages from terrorists and spies cannot be deciphered.  But some experts argue that such efforts could actually undermine national security, noting that any back doors inserted into encryption programs can be exploited by those outside the government. It is the latest in a series of intelligence leaks by Mr Snowden, a former NSA contractor, who began providing caches of sensitive government documents to media outlets three months ago. In June, the 30-year-old fled his home in Hawaii, where he worked at a small NSA installation, to Hong Kong, and subsequently to Russia after making revelations about a secret US data-gathering programme. A US federal court has since filed espionage charges against Mr Snowden and is seeking his extradition. Mr Snowden, however, remains in Russia where he has been granted temporary asylum."

Up to 350,000 people could be affected , it said, and some of its own financial information had been stolen. The Japanese developer is best known for franchises such as Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Monster Hunter. A week-and-a-half earlier, it had said there was no indication customer information had been accessed. Digitally scrambled But in an update on Monday, Capcom confirmed its servers had been hit by an attack on 2 November.  Ransomware is malicious software that typically threatens to block a victim's access to their own records unless a blackmail payment is made. In this case, the attackers digitally scrambled some of the data on Capcom's servers, making it impossible to view or amend, and destroyed some files outright. The Ragnar Locker hacker group had then demanded to be paid to undo the encryption involved, Capcom said. On Ragnor Locker's dark-net webpage, the hackers didn't just post Capcom's data but also an ominous message. In broken English they wrote the Japanese company didn't ""make a right decision and save data from leakage"".  This - and the fact Capcom is openly talking about the hack - suggests the company chose not to pay the cyber-criminals' extortion demand. Many, including law enforcement, would actually see this as absolutely the right decision. For 18 months, police the world over have been desperately imploring ransomware victims not to pay hackers. The groups have made millions from companies, which often feel they have no other option but to fork out. But it seems Capcom has found a way through without yielding.  No doubt the incident has affected the firm's reputation and some sensitive data is already surfacing online. But reading the disappointment in Ragnor Locker's statement is refreshing and rare. So far, Capcom has confirmed only nine people's personal information was definitely compromised, all current or former employees. But up to 350,000 customers, business partners, and other employees might also be affected, it said. Although, it could not be sure because its own logs had been ""lost as a result of the attack"". Resident Evil-maker hit in latest gaming hack Game firms targeted as part of global hacking plot The information includes different combinations of names, addresses, birthdays, phone numbers and email addresses, depending on why the data was gathered.  For example, some was from Japanese customer support and some from the American Capcom store or e-sports operation. 'Deepest apologies' ""None of the at-risk data contains credit-card information,"" Capcom's statement said.  ""All online transactions... are handled by a third-party service provider. ""And as such, Capcom does not maintain any such information internally."" The company also said it was safe for gamers to continue to play its games online and to use its websites. Police have been notified, as have the Japanese and UK data-protection watchdogs.

Revenues leaped 355% to $663.5m (Â£496.3m) for the three months ending 31 July, beating analysts' expectations of $500.5m. Profits soared to $186m, while customer growth rose 458%, compared with the same period in 2019. Video conferencing apps remain crucial due to the increase in remote working. Zoom's shares hit a record high on Monday, closing at $325.10, as the firm raised its annual revenue forecast by more than 30% to the range of $2.37bn-$2.39bn, from its previous projection of $1.78bn-$1.80bn. Key to Zoom's success was its ability to add paying customers - high-budget corporate clients - as opposed to those who use its services for free.  Zoom sees sales boom amid pandemic Coronavirus: Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars The company said that its large customers - firms that generated more than $100,000 in revenue in the past year - doubled to 988 during the quarter. Zoom, together with rivals Cisco Webex and Microsoft Teams, have all seen a surge in usage of their video conferencing platforms since coronavirus lockdown measures were imposed by multiple countries in March.  But Zoom's soaring popularity has also strained its infrastructure, with some outages last week as schools in many parts of the US resumed classes virtually. Its reputation also took a hit, as the new attention prompted hackers to hijack meetings and exposed a host of security flaws, revealing that the firm had sent user data to Facebook, had wrongly claimed the app had end-to-end encryption, and was allowing meeting hosts to track attendees. Zoom has also faced political scrutiny for its ties to China - where it has more than 700 staff, including most of its product development team - which have prompted warnings that it is not fit for government use.

Several countries have criticised China for imposing a new security law, which they say threatens the territory's long-standing autonomy. The announcements are likely to put pressure on Apple to do likewise. While the others' services are blocked in mainland China, Apple's are not. However, Facebook, Google and Twitter do generate revenue from selling advertising to Chinese clients. Apple complied with the majority of requests it received from Hong Kong's government between January and June, before the new law came into effect,  according to the firm's latest transparency report . Microsoft - which has  also previously handed over data about its users to Hong Kong's authorities , and maintains a significant presence in mainland China - has not announced a change in policy either. The BBC has asked the two companies for comment. 'Right of privacy' Chat app Telegram - headquartered in London - was first to announce plans to halt co-operation. ""We understand the right of privacy of our Hong Kong users,""  the firm told the Hong Kong Free Press on Sunday . ""Accordingly, Telegram does not intend to process any data requests related to its Hong Kong users until an international consensus is reached in relation to the ongoing political changes in the city."" Facebook followed saying it would stop considering the requests, ""pending further assessment"" of the human rights issues.

The 20-year-old, from Blackburn, who can only be identified as RXG, sent encrypted messages inciting an Australian to launch attacks in 2015. He was jailed for life that year after admitting inciting terrorism overseas. But the Parole Board now says it is ""satisfied"" he is suitable for release. ""After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in detention, and the evidence presented at the hearings, the panel was satisfied that RXG was suitable for release,"" the board said in a document detailing the decision.

Their account will be listed as ""inactive"". And inactive accounts can be deleted after 120 days. Calls and notifications will still function for ""a short while"" but, TechCrunch reported,  probably only a ""few weeks"" . WhatsApp announced the update in January. There was a backlash among many users who thought it meant the company was planning to change the amount of data it shared with its parent company, Facebook. It later clarified this was not the case - the update is actually aimed at enabling payments to be made to businesses. Notifying users WhatsApp already shares some information with Facebook, such as the user's IP address (a sequence of numbers attached to every device which connects to the internet, it can also be used to pin down its location) and purchases made via the platform.  But this is not the case in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist.

Police Scotland has spent more than Â£500,000 buying 41 desktop-sized machines which override encryption on devices. The move has already been delayed amid concerns the  technology may be unlawful . The force insisted the devices would significantly speed up investigations.   Phones now form a major part of criminal investigations and forensic experts in Scotland examine about 15,000 a year. The police devices - known as ""cyber kiosks"" - will plug into phones or tablets and trained operators will then look for information relevant to an investigation.  image copyright Police Scotland image caption Officers can choose which types of data they want to access Only information held on devices, such as social media messages or call logs, can be accessed by Police Scotland and the force says all logs of the data captured are deleted after an examination.   Call to delay use of Police Scotland data devices Police Scotland cyber kiosks 'could be unlawful' Should police be allowed to forensically search mobiles? Deputy Chief Constable Malcolm Graham said: ""Increases in the involvement of digital devices in investigations mean that demand on digital forensic examinations is higher than ever.  ""Current limitations, however, mean the devices of victims, witnesses and suspects can be taken for months at a time, even if it later transpires that there is no worthwhile evidence on them. ""By quickly identifying devices which do and do not contain evidence, we can minimise the intrusion on people's lives and provide a better service to the public."" The force has  published a video to explain more about the new devices  to the public.  image copyright Police Scotland image caption Officers have been trained in using the new equipment Seized units being examined by the police will include those handed over voluntarily by victims and witnesses, as well as those obtained under the authority of a judicial warrant, statutory power or following a suspect's arrest. 'Fell below the standard' The technology was first trialled in both Edinburgh and Stirling in 2016 using phones and SIM cards which had been legally seized by frontline officers. However, this came in for criticism, including from  Holyrood's justice sub-committee , after it emerged members of the public whose phones were seized and searched were not made aware they were taking part in the trial.  Police Scotland has since ""acknowledged that the previous trials fell below the standard that would be expected of the service"" but the force said concerns about the use of personal data have been the subject of ""extensive consultation and scrutiny"". The full rollout of the devices, which have seen 410 frontline officers trained to use them, is expected to be completed by May. A number of groups, including the Scottish Human Rights Commission and Privacy International, have argued that the legal basis for device examination has not been made sufficiently clear.  Clare Connelly, of the Faculty of Advocates, has previously said she does not believe the technology complies with European law.  Police Scotland said these concerns had been addressed.

Video courtesy of the journalists organisation Frontline Club. A novel use of encryption by whistle-blowing website Wikileaks could ""challenge the legal system for years to come,"" according to an influential observer of the hacking community.  Emmanuel Goldstein, editor of 2600 The Hacker Quarterly magazine, made his comments in reference to an encrypted file recently posted on the site. Some suspect the file - as yet unopened - contains further sensitive material. It has been reposted around the web and is available for anyone to download. So far, it has beeen downloaded 100,000 times.  ""If you release it in encrypted form, nobody really knows if you've released it or not - or even what the material is,"" Mr Goldstein told BBC News.  ""Then, if something happens to you, all it takes is the revelation of a simple spoken phrase known by a select group of people and everyone who has this mystery file now has all of the secrets."" 'Uncrackable file' Wikileaks recently published 76,000 secret US military logs detailing military actions in Afghanistan; an act the US authorities described as highly irresponsible. The website now says it will release 15,000 further sensitive documents, once it has completed a review aimed at minimising the risk that the release could put people's lives in danger. The site came under criticism after it released the first tranche for endangering the lives of informants or others named in the documents.  The release of the logs has led many to wonder what action the US might take against Wikileaks. Now it seems the site may be using encryption as insurance against legal and other threats to the information it holds. The insurance.aes256 file has been posted alongside the already published leaked war logs and can be downloaded by anyone.  image caption Some have speculated that the insurance file is another video From the file name, it is believed that it has been encrypted using the AES256 algorithm - described as ""extremely strong"" by Professor Whitfield Diffie, of the Information Security Group at Royal Holloway University, London. Prof Diffie believes that AES256, which he says has been ""extensively studied"" could prove too tough even for US intelligence agencies to break. While no-one knows what the insurance file contains, this has not prevented the contents becoming a matter of considerable speculation. Some suspect that the file contains a further leaked US military video, others that it is another tranche of US military logs - perhaps this time from Iraq. Or it could  just be an imaginative bluff. Even the name of the directory in which it is held - ""straw-glass-and-bottle"" - has prompted discussion and debate online. 'Historical value' Speaking at a recent event at London's Frontline Club, Wikileaks founder Julian Assange told attendees how the use of encryption could help overcome legal efforts to prevent publication. Mr Assange told the BBC that Wikileaks had often distributed encrypted material among its members in order to protect it. ""We have over a long period of time distributed encrypted backups of material we have yet to release,"" he told the gathering. ""All we have to do is release the password to that material and it is instantly available,"" he said. By publishing the encrypted documents publicly, Mr Assange said Wikileaks was protecting material of historical value. ""That duty to history is something that weighs heavily with us. If you had the Stasi archive in your pocket, that is a very heavy pocket indeed,"" he said. ""We take precautions to make sure that sort of material is not going to disappear from history regardless of the sort of threats to this organisation."" Intelligence test But with the ""insurance file"" Wikileaks has taken the unusual step of making an encrypted backup - if that is indeed what it is - publicly available online. Emanuel Goldstein told the BBC: ""Julian is smart. He always has a backup, which is the rule of thumb in this community."" But he believes this goes further than just a need to preserve information. image caption Wikileaks has come under criticism for its most recent leaks ""It's a fascinating tactic and one which will challenge the legal system for years to come."" In Mr Goldstein's view, any attempt now to seize or prevent publication of material held by Wikileaks will be self-defeating because thousands of copies will already have been distributed world wide. It is, he says, ""a tactic of intelligence to ward off the inevitable clampdown."" But Cindy Cohn, legal director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation is less convinced the file represents a challenge to the US government. ""I don't see it as a challenge, as much as being open about what's going on,"" she told the BBC. In Ms Cohn's view the idea of circulating encrypted copies of information to keep it safe is well-established. The tactic, according to Ms Cohn, has been used in the past by human rights groups and other organisations. She points to projects like Freenet, which use encryption and wide distribution of data to resist censorship. ""Wikileaks is doing the same basic thing in a more directly political context and using encryption to allow them to be more open about it on the front end."" For Prof Diffie, the release of information in this way does open up interesting possibilities. ""In a sense communications networks can be defined entirely by who has cryptographic keys, and I think a lot of networks will work that way in the future."" That's a view which will not be good news for those trying to prevent groups sharing and publishing leaked material. ""I think that the people who are trying to shut down Wikileaks are going to have to accept this as a fact of reality that cryptography allows you to do this kind of thing,"" Prof Diffie said.

New York's attorney general has written to the firm raising concerns over its ability to cope with the rise in users. Zoom is now being used by millions of people for work and leisure, as lockdowns are imposed in many countries. But its data security and privacy measures have been questioned. The letter from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James asked Zoom whether it had reviewed its security measures since its popularity surged. It also pointed out that in the past the app had been slow to address issues. In response to a request from the BBC for comment, a company spokesperson said: ""Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously. ""During the Covid-19 pandemic, we are working around-the-clock to ensure that hospitals, universities, schools, and other businesses across the world can stay connected and operational. We appreciate the New York Attorney General's engagement on these issues and are happy to provide her with the requested information,"" it added. Zoom is in everyone's living room - how safe is it? Racist 'zoombombing' during synagogue meeting Laid off over Zoom: Firms cut staff by conference call Users have flocked to Zoom as governments around the world ordered large parts of their populations to stay at home to slow the spread of the virus. It is now ranked as the number two and number one app in the UK and US, respectively. Zoom has had security flaws in the past, including a vulnerability which allowed an attacker to remove attendees from meetings, spoof messages from users and hijack shared screens. Another saw Mac users forced into calls without their knowledge. It also doesn't offer end-to-end encryption, according to online news publication The Intercept. This is encryption that should mean no-one other than participants can see a meeting.  Zoom told it: ""Currently, it is not possible to enable E2E encryption for Zoom video meetings."" This means Zoom can access the video and audio of meetings, it reported. Because Zoom uses email domains to identify users who may be in the same company, the service will sometimes allow small internet service providers' customers to see each others' private data, reported Vice's tech website Motherboard.  The company told Motherboard that it regularly updates a  list of private email providers to avoid this.  Zoom has  also been criticised for its ""attendee tracking"" feature , which, when enabled, lets the host of the Zoom call check if participants are clicking away from the main Zoom window during a call. More recently, the UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week tweeted a picture of himself chairing a Cabinet meeting using Zoom, leading to questions about how secure it was.

Thomas Maher, originally from Ireland, has been sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court to more than 14 years in jail after pleading guilty to drugs and money-laundering charges.  He made thousands of pounds a week, using an encrypted Encrochat phone to fix the movement of drugs and money.  He is the first major crime boss jailed using messages obtained when French police cracked the Encrochat network. The phones were considered mandatory for high-end organised crime, and more than a thousand suspects have been arrested on the strength of the evidence their messages contain.  Hundreds arrested as crime chat network cracked Encrypted mobile cracked to convict drug dealer Maher, 39, used the Encrochat handles ""Satirical"" and ""Snacker"" as he did deals with organised crime networks in the UK, Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and Bulgaria.   The National Crime Agency says he was ""hugely influential"" among Europe's drug cartels.  Sentencing him, Judge Aubrey QC said Maher was ""a high-ranking facilitator... a go-between for criminal networks needing to transport their drugs between Holland and Ireland"".   Passing a sentence of 14 years and eight months, the judge told Maher: ""You were an extremely important cog in the wheel of a sophisticated network."" Maher would arrange for lorries to move massive loads of drugs hidden alongside legitimate cargoes such as fruit or wine in one direction and then to bring cash in the other direction.  image copyright NCA image caption The NCA kept Maher under surveillance after French police passed on details of his activities Police found out about his operation after he was arrested in connection with the deaths of 39 Vietnamese migrants while they were being transported to the UK in October 2019. He had previously owned the trailer in which they were found.   The NCA put him under surveillance in an attempt to identify the scale of his criminal activities. However, the cracking of the Encrochat network by French intelligence and the Gendarmerie provided the National Crime Agency with thousands of his encrypted messages.  They were able to watch, almost in real time, as he did deals with crime bosses around Europe.  image copyright NCA Martin Clark, from the NCA, said he posed as an ""honest haulier"", but was in fact ""very much a professional facilitator and he's done it all remotely sitting in his living room"". ""He's never personally been anywhere near any of it."" In fact, the NCA said he had been scrupulous about social distancing during the pandemic while communicating via Encrochat with dozens of criminals.  The evidence the agency has uncovered shines a new light on the way in which a smuggling network operates.  Maher would be contacted by clients wanting to move hundreds of kilos of drugs.  The messages were written in criminal slang. He would discuss deals involving shipments of ""tops"" (top shelf drugs such as cocaine), or ""Colo"" (the purest form from Colombia).  Heroin, which he deemed a more downmarket drug, was known as ""bottoms"".  Shipments might come from ""The Flat"" (The Netherlands) and the lorry returned with ""paper"" (cash).  Decoding the criminals  Officers working on Encrochat cases are having to develop skills in understanding the slang suspects are using in their messages.  In this message Thomas Maher (Satirical) is telling an alleged co-conspirator that they're not doing too badly despite the lockdown. Helpfully for police he sets out the network of drug transportation routes he is currently operating:  ""Taxi ways are working out OK at the minute with this fella from flat to ours and Belgium to ours am other that's two - and plus a driver with [redacted] for Poly's sun to flat and we still have [redacted] turk to flat and and his men [redacted] to here where I am. Once we get this travel ban lifted m8 we be on the pigs bk that alone is a lot of taxi plus we have the receiver here from Asia so m8 we have a lot more than others... that's why I'm not stressing yet The police translation reads:  ""Our HGV drug courier business is working out OK at the moment. Someone is bringing shipments from Holland and Belgium to the UK. There's a driver for ecstasy from Spain to Holland, and we still have Turkey to Holland, and [redacted] is bringing shipments to the UK. Once the travel ban is lifted we will be doing rather well. That alone is a lot of shipments plus we have someone bringing drugs in from Asia.  So, we have a lot more than other gangs... that's why I'm not stressing yet.  However, like many users of the Encrochat network, Maher believed his messages could not be read, so he didn't bother trying to communicate in code. Crucial evidence was obtained from pictures on his phone. His drivers would photograph the shipments to prove they had been picked up.  They would sometimes use a ""token"" during the handover.  This involved showing a particular Euro bank note, with digits previously agreed as evidence of identity.  When Maher was moving drugs he would earn around Â£3,500 each time. For money, transported for laundering in consignments of 300,000 euros at a time, he would ""skim"" 1% of the total as his payment Luxury watches He was ""always showing Â£50 notes in the pub"", Martin Clark said, and people were suspicious that he was a criminal. Maher lived in a ""fairly modest"" Cheshire home, but police surveillance spotted luxury cars including a Range Rover, Porsche Cayenne, Mercedes GLS and Corvette parked on the drive.  When they raided his house they found evidence he had spent hundreds of thousands of pounds on Rolex and Hublot watches.   He had taken holidays in Dubai, Mexico and New York where he liked to buy pricey modern art, including a map of the world created from bullets.

A new level of encryption will also be introduced across the platform from 30 May, which it says will ""provide increased protection for meeting data and resistance against tampering"".    Jo O'Reilly, deputy editor at ProPrivacy, has suggested that Zoom still has some way to go if it is to stop large-scale companies such as Google from banning the use of the platform.  ""This update may be enough to get consumers back on board,"" she told the BBC.  ""However, if they want to turn the tide of big companies and government moving away from using Zoom, it is going to take more than superficial fixes such as enforced passwords. ""The bigger issues such as the of the lack of end-to-end encryption, making it unsuitable for commercially or politically sensitive meetings, are much trickier to solve"","" added Ms O'Reilly.  Perpetrators of video-call hijackings can often be hard to identify and track down, due to the quick nature of the attacks.  Such an attack occurred on 30 April during a video conference to mark the end of Sexual Assault Awareness Month.  According to  The Mercury News , a hacker posted a video depicting child abuse, and forced the meeting to end.  The community-organised event in San Francisco had been intended to allow victims of sexual assault to share their stories. A spokesman for the District Attorney said they were aware of the matter and were looking into it.  âWe are horrified about what occurred during one of our partnerâs town hall events promoting Sexual Assault Awareness Month,"" he said.

Google is hoping to end low quality video calls by deploying artificial intelligence to ""fill in"" audio gaps caused by bad connections.  WaveNetEQ works by using a library of speech data to realistically continue short segments of conversations.  The AI is trained to produce mostly syllable sounds, and can fill gaps of up to 120 milliseconds.   It comes as the use of video calls has become increasingly important during the corornavirus crisis. UK government defends PM's use of Zoom Coronavirus: Racist 'zoombombing' at virtual synagogue When making a call over the internet, data is split into small chunks called packets.  A poor connection can mean these packets reach the other party in the wrong order and at the wrong time, or cause them to be lost entirely. This can result in a significant decline in call quality.    Google says 99% of calls made using its Duo app experience some form of audio-related issue. Of these calls, 20% lose more than 3% of their total audio, while 10% lose almost a tenth.  WaveNetHQ works by specifically creating speech data to fill the gaps made by drops in audio. Data-sharing The AI has been trained using the voices of 100 individuals in 48 languages to enable it to learn the general characteristics of a human voice, regardless of dialect.  Douglas Crawford, cyber security researcher at ProPrivacy, says that Duo's end-to-end encryption should help alleviate any concerns about data-sharing.  ""As calls on the platform are secured using end-to-end encryption, outsourcing AI-processing of missing packets in order to reduce audio jitters was simply not an option for developers,"" he told the BBC. ""Google solved this by performing all the processing on your device so that no data is ever transmitted to a third party.

New York couples can now tie the knot over Zoom Zoom under increased scrutiny as popularity soars Zoom is in everyone's living room - how safe is it? One of the appâs most high-profile issues has been âZoombombingâ incidents, where uninvited guests crash meetings. This has led to several companies, schools and governments stopping the use of the platform. In the UK there has been debate about whether the government should be using Zoom for cabinet meetings, after Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted a picture which included the ID number of the latest meeting. It has also been reported that Elon Musk has banned the use of Zoom for SpaceX meetings over security concerns. Nasa, which is one of Space X's biggest customers, also prevents employees from using it. Meanwhile, Singapore suspended the use of video-conferencing tool Zoom by its teachers, after a ""very serious incident"" during a home-based lesson. Singapore's Ministry of Education has since announced that teaching over Zoom was now resuming, with enhanced security measures.   Earlier this month Zoom said it would pause the development of any new features to concentrate on safety and privacy issues. Mr Yuan apologised for ""falling short"" on security issues and promised to address concerns, saying that the use of Zoom had soared in ways he could never have foreseen prior to the coronavirus pandemic. That came as daily user numbers have soared to 300 million from 10 million in less than three months. At the same time New York's attorney general has written to the firm raising concerns over its ability to cope with the rise in users. The letter from the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James asked Zoom whether it had reviewed its security measures since its popularity surged. It also pointed out that in the past the app had been slow to address issues. In response to a request from the BBC for comment, a company spokesperson said: ""Zoom takes its users' privacy, security, and trust extremely seriously.""

The original cut-off date was 8 February, but users now have until 15 May to take action. The firm was criticised for sending the notification, which seemed to suggest changes to the data it would share with its parent company Facebook.

It added that its practice of sharing some user data with Facebook was not new, and was not going to be expanded.  ""The update includes new options people will have to message a business on WhatsApp, and provides further transparency about how we collect and use data,"" it said.

He tweeted that the company was refusing to unlock iPhones ""used by killers, drug dealers and other violent criminal elements"". On Monday US Attorney General William Barr accused Apple of not being helpful in an inquiry into a shooting that is being treated as a terrorist act. It is the latest in a series of clashes between the White House and technology giants over access to data. Mr Trump accused Apple of refusing to co-operate with investigators despite his administration helping the company on trade and other issues. We are helping Apple all of the time on TRADE and so many other issues, and yet they refuse to unlock phones used by killers, drug dealers  and other violent criminal elements. They will have to step up to the plate and help our great Country, NOW! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump)  January 14, 2020   The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. View original tweet on Twitter The president's comments came a day after  Mr Barr said Apple had failed to provide ""substantive assistance"" to unlock two iPhones in an investigation into a fatal shooting  at a naval base in Pensacola, Florida. Three US sailors were killed when a Saudi trainee at the base opened fire on 6 December.  Apple said it rejected the claim that it had failed to help officials in their investigation. ""Our responses to their many requests since the attack have been timely, thorough and are ongoing,"" it said in a statement. US urges Apple to unlock air base shooter's phones Should governments be given keys to access our messages? New police equipment to search mobile devices This is not the first time Apple has clashed with the US justice department. After a mass shooting in San Bernardino, California in 2015, in which  14 people were killed and 22 others were seriously injured ,  Apple refused to help gain access to the gunman's iPhone . The US government ended up paying another company a reported $1m (Â£770,000) to develop software to get around the device's encryption. The disputes highlight the ongoing disagreement between the technology industry and law enforcement agencies around the world. On one side encryption plays a crucial role in protecting people's privacy, on the other it can cause major issues for criminal investigators.
